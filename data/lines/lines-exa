You spent it all.
- I did?
- Maybe you got too many furs.
- Why didn't you try to stop me?
- Tried to do that, bro.
- You did?
- I sure did.
Yo, Tina!
Yo, baby, everything gonna be all right.
It sho' is.
You still got a little modeling left in you.
It'll be chump change compared to what I used to bring in... but it'll get us by until the commissioner comes to his senses.
Come on, baby.
Where you at?
I'm in the bedroom.
I'll be out in a minute.
Yeah, well, come on.
Ain't that much makeup in the world.
You know I had a rough couple of days.
You ought to be rubbing a brother down.
The Banshees.
- Losing all control.
-And they're back.
I'm prepare to rumble.
Are you?
- Get your tickets today.
- I'll rumble with you.
I'll rumble with you all night long.
- Women's basketball.
What a joke.
-Jamal, I'm leaving.
Okay.
While you're out, why don't you pick a brother up something to eat.
I'm--
Baby, what you doing?
That's the good luggage.
Don't make it easy on 'em.
Put this--
- What is that?
- My stuff.
I'm leaving you.
What do you mean you leaving?
The only reason why I stayed with your lyin', cheating' ass... is because you were rich and famous.
- But now you're neither, so what's the point?
- What are you talking about?
What about all the good lovin' you was getting up in here?
I packed it.
The batteries too.
Good-bye, Jamal.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Yeah, you try to come back... you're gonna have to start at the bottom of the list.
Yeah,yeah,yeah.
That's why I'm leaving your broke ass.
Yeah, plus your feet stink!
All right, listen to me.
You wanna win this thing, it's real simple.
You go inside and you act like an adult.
That's all.
If you forget what that is, just look around the room at everybody else.
Hold on here.
I am calm, Loren.
I am cool.
And I am ready to collect my checks.
Damn, I look good.
Mr. Jeffries, you have clearly embarrassed the league, your team... and I certainly hope you've embarrassed yourself.
What is it you're here to say to me today?
Uh, I'm here to say that--
I'm here to say that-- that what I did was wrong, and, uh...
I sincerely, uh--
I am-- I'm sincerely--
He apologizes, sir.
He is very apologetic.
This is not your arbitration hearing, Mr. Daniels.
May I remind you it's your client's.
He is the one with the oversized ego... that may be eclipsing his talent at this point.
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hold, Colonel Sanders.
Hold on.
- Mm!
Excuse me. "Oversized ego eclipsing his talent?"
Perhaps you haven't seen my game in a while, Pops.
Maybe you need to trim some of them mother-- bushes off your-- head.
You'd be able to see my mother-- game.
Don't try to give me no shit.
- Take that.
What you got, baby?
- I'm gonna show you what I got.
I'm gonna show you what I got right now.
You still ain't saying nothing.
- Ooh!
Jamal, you holding up the game.
- Here.
- Esther.
Uh, Esther, it's on you.
- Come on, You old biddy.
play your card.
- This bra is killing me.
You's a fine-lookin' young man.
Ooh!
Damn!
Okay, that's it.
I've-- I've had enough of the bridge club.
You ain't playing no more?
No, no.
Oh.
I need to go outside for some air.
Why, J.J.?
There's a CNN report that says... too much inside air is-is deadly.
While you're going outside... make yourself useful and pick up some groceries for the morning.
I ain't gonna fetch no groceries.
I don't do that no more, Aunt Ruby.
I'm a professional ballplayer.
I'm a star.
You a what?
You heard me.
I'm a star.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Hurry back with them groceries, star.
Gonna talk back to me in my own house.
Your house?
I was the one bought you the house.
You better get out of here.
Crazy ass.
- Man, what happened?
- What you doing?
Can't pass.
Hey, y'all, it's Jamal Jeffries.
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yeah.
Sure, kid.
- Where's your stupid stamp?
- Ooh!
- What?
- You heard me.
Thought you were hot stuff, didn't you?
But look at you now.
Look where your nasty attitude's gotten you.
- Girl, I'll take this--
- Whatever.
Why don't you just go ahead and pass me the ball, if you still know how.
Ooh!
Ooh!
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"Yeah" that.
What you got, boy?
Come on.
What you got?
What you got?
Boo-yah!
How you like me now?
Lorne Daniels, please.
Tell him it's Kobe Bryant looking for a new agent.
There you are, Lorne.
Jamal.
- You can't stop me.
- Don't hang up.
Listen to me.
I'm calling to tell you about a phenomenal basketball player I just met.
Why?
Because you were good to me and I wanna be good to you.
Listen to me.
This is the greatest basketball player you've ever seen.
And get this, Lorne, it's a girl.
That's right.
A girl.
She a little rough around the edges 'cause she's straight up from the country.
Get me Coach Rivers on the phone, immediately.
Immediately!
I'm coming
Out
I'm
I'm coming
Out
-I'm coming out
- Yeah.
- Time to get paid.
-I want the world to know
- It's time to get paid.
Time to get paid.
- Got to let it show
- Time to get-- get paid.
-I'm coming out
- Ah, yeah.
-I want the world to know
Uh!
Uh!
- Get paid.
Get paid, baby.
- Got to let it show
Get paid.
Time to get paid.
Time to get paid.
Jamal, what are you doing?
Um, I'm, um, trying on your clothes, Aunt Ruby.
Yeah, I gather that, but what are you doing?
I know this look freaky, Aunt Ruby, but it's not what you think.
Well, it can't get much better than what I think.
Jamal, there's no way I'm helping you do this.
- Aunt Ruby-
- Aunt Ruby, please.
- Mm-mmm.
Boy, get up off your knees in my pants.
Aunt Ruby!
Jamal, when you were in the sixth grade... who was there for you when you traded your little baby cousin...
- for a new pair ofbasketball shoes?
- You were there, Aunt Ruby.
You were there for me, but I need you.
I was there, helped you through it, didn't ask no questions... didn't pass no judgments, but this--
Boy, don't you give me them puppy dog eyes.
- Aunt Ruby, you have to help me.
You got to help me.
- Uh-uh.
Jamal, no!
Are you watching?
Are you watching?
Good shot.
Good shot.
That's what I'm talking about.
Way to break it down.
Lorne, practice is almost over.
I think your blind date just stood you up.
Looks that way, Jennifer.
Coach.
Sorry.
Listen.
It's all my fault.
I trusted somebody.
I should've known better--
- I'm here!
- Hold up.
Uh, Latisha.
Guard her.
I hope your game's as tight as your ass.
Girl, I chase chickens quicker than you.
I hope you can make that ball bounce like them titties of yours.
- Just keep your eyes on me.
- Come on with it.
There you go.
Boom!
Sweet.
Come on.
Let's go.
Here I go.
And... boom!
- That costs money.
- Come on, girls!
- Ball!
Ball!
- Ball what?
Too easy.
- Yeah.
- Where did you find her?
I heard about her from a friend.
- Ball!
- I got her!
Damn.
You made me miss.
That's blocking.
What?
Oh, please.
You got to be kidding me.
She made me miss it.
Blocking.
Ladies, that's it.
Nicejob.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Uh, so, why don't you call me in the morning... and maybe we can work something out.
Yeah.
Thanks, Coach.
What's your name anyway, hotshot?
- I don't know myself.
What is it?
- Let's get pizza.
You wanna?
- Ju-
- Juwanna.
- Juwanna?
- Yes.
Juwanna, man.
- Juwanna Mann, Coach Rivers.
- It's great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Coach.
- You all right?
- Yo, I'm straight.
- No, you not.
- And you must be Lorne.
- That's right.
- Jamal's told me so much about you.
- Really?
Didn't tell me you were so cute though.
Juwanna!
How's my favorite girl?
Come on in.
Sit down.
- Oh, why, thank you, Mr. Daniels.
- Please, call me Lorne.
You should be on a first-name basis with the man who's about to change your life.
- Oh, really?
Gonna change my life?
-Absolutely.
I don't know how I did it.
Well, that's not completely true.
This here is a one-year contract for you with the Charlotte Banshees.
- Oh, my Lord, are you kidding me?
- No.
- Oh, my Lord!
- Mm-hmm.
- Am I dreaming?
- No, you're not dreaming.
Go ahead.
Pinch yourself.
I'll wait.
This is the first time in my life I've ever been speechless.
That is the beauty of signing a contract.
There's no speech really required.
So just go ahead and sign there.
Don't I need to get a lawyer to take a look at this thing before I sign it?
Of course not.
These contracts are completely standard at this point.
All the hard work's been done by me.
Just go ahead and sign.
I guess it's better than playing in the parks.
- It certainly is.
Right here.
- Right here?
And here.
And here.
Juwanna.
Juwanna.
Juwanna.
That's a lovely signature.
Congratulations, Juwanna.
You are about to become the newest member... of the Charlotte Banshees.
- Whee-ee.
I am so excited.
All in one day I'm starting a whole new life... and I have my very own big-time agent.
Oh, I don't want you to just think of me as your agent.
I'm also your friend.
Oh, that is so sweet, Lorne.
And I don't want you to only think of me as just your client... because I am also your ex-client, biatch.
- Got you, didn't I?
- Oh, shit.
Give me the fax.
Give it to me.
- Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Come on.
- Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Daniels.
Mr.--
- Give it to me.
- Mr. Daniels.
Mr. Daniels.
- Your wife is on line three.
- Tell her I'm with a client, will you?
Okey-dokey.
- God, this is great!
- Uh-huh.
- Got your ass.
Got your ass.
- Betty.
Betty.
Betty!
I want you to get Coach Rivers on the line immediately, as in right now.
All right, okay.
When Coach Rivers gets on the phone, tell her the whole truth.
Okay.
I will.
I'll tell her.
I'll say, "Coach Rivers, yeah--
"The only way Lorne could make money offi me was to dress me up like this... and trick you into signing me."
That's not at all the truth.
I had nothing to do with this.
What do you mean you had nothing to do with it?
All I did was tell you about a phenomenal basketball player, and what did you do?
You set up the tryouts, you negotiated the contract, you brokered the deal, baby.
You kind of created me.
You're Frankenstein.
Oh, God.
No, no, no.
No, this is crazy.
- No one's gonna believe you're a woman.
- You did.
- This is blackmail.
- No, it's not.
This is black fe-male.
- That's not funny.
- What do you expect me to do?
Basketball is the only thing I really know how to do.
And I have to make a living.
So until you figure out how to get me back with my team... you can just look for me in the women's locker room, baby.
The women's locker room, checking out booties.
Checking out booties.
- Basketball booties.
- Jamal.
I thought we were friends.
Oh.
Now, see, there's a problem.
You're not my friend, Lorne.
Remember?
You're my agent.
Thanks to you, Lorne, I'm gonna be a Charlotte Banshee.
You're better than Jerry Maguire.
Somebody kill me!
- Y'all ready for this?
- Who's ready to play?
Who's ready to win?
- Banshees!
- Ban--
- Shees!
- Ban--
- Shees!
Banshees.
It's the opening game of the WUBA season.
Hi.
Welcome inside the Charlotte Coliseum.
Along with Jeanne Zelasko, I'm Chris Myers.
We have a terrific matchup for you today.
The Charlotte Banshees hosting the two-time defending champion, Houston Gallop.
With all-stars in the lineup like Michelle Langford and Natalie Kemper... you have to believe the Banshees have a great shot at beating the Gallop.
Jamal.
- Jamal.
- Juwanna.
- Lorne.
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise... for the singing of our national anthem.
Singing for us today is multi-platinum recording artist, Romeo.
Oh, say
Can you see
By the dawn's
Early light
You don't understand how excited I am.
My very first game.
I saw television cameras.
Did you know this game is being televised?
I sure did, and I'm still trying to figure out what's my best side.
- Here or my ass.
- I think--
At the twilight's
Last gleaming
- Promise me you'll try to fit in.
- I will try to fit in.
All right.
There is no dunking in this league.
I won't dunk.
I promise.
Relax.
It's not like I need to anyway.
I got to go.
Now, keep your head up.
Yeah.
Keep your boobs up.
For you.
- For my baby.
- How sweet.
- See you after the game?
- No doubt, baby.
That boy drop more shit than the bunny rabbit on Ex-Lax.
But she's so blind she can't see past his great, big ol' walking stick.
Ain't that right, girl?
- What's up, player?
- What's up, player player?
Give me some, player.
What's the deal, baby?
I'm just a squirrel in your world.
I see you're doing your thing.
- You're looking at something.
- Man, hot dogs and hamburgers, man.
She's all that and a baseball bat and a hot wheel track.
I'm telling you, brown sugar like D'Angelo.
Brown Sugar That's what he was talking about-- right there.
Oh!
She gonna block me out, huh?
-She with it though.
- I know she with it.
Yeah, baby.
Drop it like it's hot.
All right!
Yeah!
That's all right, girl.
We get it next time, Natalie.
Hit.
Two shots.
Yeah, that's a nice girl there.
She a little naive though.
Foreigner.
Here on a visa from Oklahoma.
She gonna be a city girl before long.
She rooming with Sanchez.
That little hot tamale over there.
That girl get around.
Really?
How awful.
Awful.
Block out, Magda.
With that big-ass head, she could block out the sun.
I said block out, you Serbian knucklehead!
- Way to go!
- So, what's your story?
Me?
I like to keep it simple.
You give me a good book and a good bitch, I'm straight.
I like you.
Yes, Natalie.
Way to get in there.
Time out!
- Come on, Natalie!
- All right, Natalie!
All right, hotshot.
- Let's see what you got.
- All right, Coach.
Now you're coaching.
There has been a substitution, and the new player is number 22.
Chris, that is Juwanna Mann.
- Yo, you see that?
- That deserves a "wow."
Wrong.
Na-na-na-na.
Beer and a popcorn.
It's all right.
Okay.
The ball is stolen away.
What a move.
No!
No!
No!
Pass the ball!
Don't dunk!
The 360.
Another amazing shot.
Ain't nothing sexier than a woman with ball control.
All right!
Yes!
Pass the ball!
Pass the ball!
- Here I go.
Here I go.
You ready?
- Ball!
Ball!
It's mine!
Mine!
22, Offense.
22, hit.
Technical right here.
If y'all hadn't been playing like a bunch of little girls.
Coach, that girl has got to go.
You know she's the reason we lost the game.
- She wouldn't even let the ground touch the ball.
- I understand your frustration.
The woman has definitely got problems.
You got that right.
Her number-one problem is I'm not playing with her.
You're gonna have to.
We just got Natalie's MRI back.
She tore her ACL.
She's out for the rest of the season.
And I'm making Juwanna her replacement.
What?
But she's nothing but a ball hog, Coach.
You're gonna talk to me about ball hog, "Miss I Got Game, I'm All That"?
- I wasn't as bad as her.
- Michelle, you need to step up.
You're captain of this team, and I'm expecting you to help me turn this woman around.
I'm in a messy situation.
I'm stuck, and, basically, we have no choice.
That was quite a performance you had out there today.
What, 1 5 points in the second half alone.
It was, but it would've been 1 6 if y'all would have just picked up the pace.
Listen to me.
I know I'm not the captain of this team yet.
But you guys wanna win, you're gonna have to find a way to get me the ball.
- What?
- I can't pass the thing to myself.
I probably could if I worked at it, but we're supposed to be a team.
- Teamwork.
Just what we need to talk about.
- That's right.
Forget it.
Look.
You know, I'd love to work with you on your game, if you're up to it.
Go over the playbook with you... make sure you understand how the Banshees--
How you gonna work with me on my game when my game doesn't need any work?
Didn't you see it?
But I'll be more than happy to help you with a few pointers on your game.
I'll be really happy to do that-- Oh, my God.
Lord, what are you doing?
Taking a shower, Einstein.
Aren't you?
Hell, yes, I'll take a shower with-- shower soon as I get home.
I got to do it as soon as I get home.
I really can't take showers in public.
Things crawl up in you and you never find them.
Whatever.
Boy, I love this league.
What part of"don't draw attention to yourself' did you not understand?
Lorne, I'm sorry.
They were screaming and cheering for a brother-- a sister.
What was I supposed to do?
Play like a bitch?
Yes, play like a woman.
That was your plan.
- Calm down.
Chill out, man.
- You're right.
I got to calm down.
I'm overreacting.
Absolutely.
I'm not used to going to a game and praying that my client's boobs don't fall out!
You keep this up, I'm gonna be booking clowns at birthday parties.
That's your problem.
My problem is I need a shower.
I sweat more as a woman.
Jamal, please.
I'm fairly certain I can get you an arbitration hearing.
But until then, I need you to keep a low profile.
That's all.
- Okay.
- Can you do that?
I can do that, Lorne.
I'll keep a low profile.
I promise.
Damn, you're gonna have a heart attack if you keep that shit up.
- Yeah.
- I'm telling you.
Bye-bye, Lorne.
What a snake.
I knew it.
- Holler at ya.
- I'll holler at you too.
- Hold up, little girl.
Let me tell you something.
- Ooh!
You are one tall glass of water... and I'm telling you "scraight" up, I'm thirsty.
- What in the hell are you?
- You don't know who I am, do you?
- No, I don't.
Who are you?
- I am Puff Smokey Smoke.
You wanna kiss it, don't you?
That's right.
Uh-huh.
Rap extraordinaire.
I also sang background on Romeo's last album...
"Where There's Smoke There's Firestone."
Watch the Firestone tires
Oh, really?
Well, you can sing backup for me right now.
Just back right on up.
Thank you very much, Mr. Puffer, but I have to go.
Drive careful now, baby... 'cause you are definitely precious cargo.
You ready?
You ready?
Pass the ball.
Juwanna!
Juwanna.
What the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm sweating.
I'm breaking down the defense.
I'm wearing these chumps out, making all the shots.
Take your pick.
You know what?
Practice is over.
Michelle, don't leave.
Stick around.
This is about you and Juwanna.
Listen, missy.
I want you to take a look up here and tell me what you see.
What I see are a bunch of empty bleaches that I'm about to help you fill.
- That's what I see.
- Very funny.
You're a funny lady.
I see a sign that says the Charlotte Banshees.
My eyes are fine, Coach.
Because it says the Charlotte Banshees... and not the Charlotte Ju-wanna.
And if the Charlotte Banshees are gonna have any chance of winning this season...
I have to get my two strongest players here to try and work together.
Otherwise, we're screwed.
So, you're gonna play with Michelle here... one-on-one... and one-on-one and one-on-one and one-on-one.
Hey, how about one-on-one?
Until you start to get with the program.
You got it?
Yeah, I got it, Coach.
Mm!
- You ready for this?
- What you got?
Come on.
- You're gonna need a pen and paper.
- That's all right.
Come on.
- Are you ready?
- What you got?
Ooh!
Boom!
Sorry about that.
Oh!
Now, that's what I call an ass-ist.
Ha ha.
Ooh!
Boom!
That's game.
You really think you're something, don't you?
Well, I got it going on.
What can I say?
Born with it.
Here we go.
The jokes.
Look, Juwanna... this might be a joke to you, but it's not to me.
You got some big balls, don't you, girl?
Yeah, yeah, but all your arrogance and all of that showboatin'... that doesn't scare me, 'cause I know it's just a cover.
Because underneath, you don't trust anybody but yourself, girl.
And that's exactly where you gonna end up, by yourself... if you don't start to trust your team.
And we'll be right back with more of Oprah.
Are you done?
No.
Don't get me wrong.
You got mad skills.
You're good.
But one player can't win games by themselves.
We need teamwork.
- So you think I got skills?
- Yeah.
I'd like to be able to do some of them moves I saw you do.
- Wrap around.
- I'd sure like to show you some of them moves.
- What?
- I sure could show you some of those moves.
- It's real easy.
- Good.
See, now we talking.
I have never seen anybody pick up some moves quicker than you.
I have never seen anybody pick up some moves quicker than you.
- You were storming'.
- Well, you know.
You know.
- Romeo!
Hey!
- What's up, girl?
What you doing?
I couldn't roll through Atlanta without my baby.
- Juwanna, I got a ride.
- All right.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
You have some trouble there, little lady?
My door's just stuck.
You go right ahead.
I can handle this.
- I don't want you to strain yourself.
- That's what you get.
I guess you don't need no man's help after all.
- No, I don't need a man, but thank you.
- It's like that.
All right.
Hey, Juwanna, You wanna hang out tomorrow before our trip to New York?
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Cool.
-Just you and me, right?
- Yeah.
- It's a date.
- All right.
What's up, baby?
- See you later.
- Bye.
I can't stand him.
Bam!
- I got a little surprise for you.
- What is it?
I love surprises.
You do?
Good.
Because I have booked us for an entire day of beauty at the spa.
Spa?
So relaxing.
- I'm looking forward to this.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm looking forward to it too.
I'm feeling relaxed already.
Hi.
Oh, yes.
Where did you leave your wings, you angel you?
Oh, my God.
Lord.
Who are you?
Slow it down now.
Oh!
- Ooh!
Slow it down, sailor.
Ooh, Lord.
Ow!
Oh!
Is there a medic?
Ooh!
Thanks, Susie.
We'll see you next time.
Yes.
Bye, Susie.
So, how you feeling?
Oh, Lord, girl, if I was any number, I think I'd be dead.
Get a good night's sleep.
We got that 7:00 a.m. flight in the morning to New York.
Don't worry about me.
My alarm's set, sweetie, right here.
- Right here.
- Good.
- Was that your first time?
- First and last, sweetie.
Shake ya ass Watch yourself
Shake ya ass Show me what you're workin'with
-Shake ya ass, watch yourself
- Oh, no.
Shake ya ass
I came in with the mic in my hand
Don't make me leave with my foot in your-
- Be cool
Don't worry about how I'm rippin'it
Oh, Lord.
Oh, Lord.
No, I don't need this.
And he's white.
Okay, I can do this.
I can do this.
Morning, Officer.
Nice morning, isn't it?
Sun shining'.
Birds a-chirpin'.
Anybody tell you you look like Mel Gibson?
Do you have any idea how fast you were going, ma'am?
Well, see, actually, Officer, my speedometer is broken on this car.
And I was looking at it, but-- How fast was I going?
- I clocked you at 50.
- Is that a little too fast?
- I'm gonna have to see your license.
- Oh, Lord.
You really think we need to go that far?
I'm not even sure if it's in this car.
I might have left it in my other car.
It's a Benz.
Well, you better have it or I'm gonna have to impound this car...
- and you and I are going for a little ride.
- Where we going?
Here it is right here.
You know, Whitney Houston's my cousin.
Jamal Jeffries.
Who's Jamal Jeffries?
- That's me, Officer.
- That's you?
- Uh-huh.
- You expect me to believe that?
Well, it's true.
You see, the thing is--
I'm not armed.
I just recently had a little operation.
You mean, one of those operations where you--
- Uh-huh.
- So, you no longer have your--
- Uh-uh.
- And now you have a--
Yes.
- Get out of the car.
- Excuse me?
- What is the problem?
- Out of the car.
Come on.
- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Step away from the vehicle.
- Away from the vehicle.
- I'm not gonna have to spread any eagles?
Come on.
Spin around.
- All right.
How about this?
- All the way.
You look fabulous.
I'm having it done too.
I'm only about a thousand dollars away right now.
Who did you?
Well, whoever it was, they did a great job.
I got my post-op outfit all ready and waiting, hanging in my closet.
- It's got little ruffles on top.
- Excuse me.
Thank you very much.
Officer, trust me.
I believe you're gonna look great when you get it done.
- But I'm really in a hurry.
I really need to go.
- Just forget the ticket.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.
- No, not at all.
- You're gonna look great.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Turn to the side.
You're gonna look great.
- You think so?
Yes.
Make sure they get those nose hairs, especially on the left side.
You're gonna look great.
Thank you very much, Officer.
You have a good day.
Juwanna, they're double-teaming you every time.
If you don't start letting go of the ball, I'm gonna sit your ass down.
- All right.
Banshees on three.
One, two, three.
- Banshees!
Juwanna, remember what we was working on back home?
Not now.
I'm in a zone, okay?
Pass the ball.
Pass the ball.
Pass the ball.
- Pass the ball!
- Pass the ball!
- You ready to play?
You ready?
- Juwanna!
Move back!
Move back!
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.
Nice job, Juwanna!
Way to pass that down, baby.
You my dog!
You my dog!
Isn't she lovely
-Isn't she wonderful
- Great shot.
Way to make a move to the basket, baby!
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
Great shot.
Great shot.
I never thought
Through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
Isn't she lovely
Made from love
Great shot, Magda.
Good shot.
All right, get in here.
Listen up, ladies.
We're gonna run green, penetrate left.
Squeeze.
A little breakdown, go right... and squeeze.
Let's win this thing.
On three.
One, two, three!
Isn't she lovely
Made from love
Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
- Whoo!
-I can't believe
What God has done
Ladies, listen up.
I got a couple of things to say here.
First of all, uh... you guys played one hell of a game tonight.
I hope there's plenty more where that came from.
For those of you who are new to the Banshees, we have a little tradition.
- After every victory--
That's right-- we give away a game ball, and tonight it should come as no surprise... that the ball goes to...
Juwanna Mann.
Yeah.
Good game, Juwanna.
- Hey, Juwanna, kick it out.
I'm open.
Thank you, guys.
I really do appreciate it.
Oh, look at her getting all misty up in here.
I really do.
I mean it.
But I think that since Magda actually made the winning shot...
I think I should share this with her.
You share ball with me?
Oh, thank you, Juwanna.
Thank you.
- Oh, no, you don't have to--
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Precious time.
Let's shower up and get the hell out of here.
Good job, ladies.
Nice work there.
It's just superstition.
Never take it off after a win.
Never take it off.
You was really getting your game on tonight, Juwanna.
I have a feeling that we're gonna have a really good season this year.
Oh, yes, we are.
Whoa!
Look at you.
Isn't this cute?
I got it at Victoria's Secret.
Mm-hmm.
Whew.
Well, the secret's out.
It's just perfect for the road,you know?
You can just keep it comfy and simple.
Mm-hmm.
Comfy and simple.
Damn.
I am so sore tonight.
- Really?
- Would you mind rubbing a bit of this on my shoulders?
Oh!
Mm-hmm.
- I'll be more than happy to.
Yeah.
- Thank you, girl.
- Yes.
All right.
We can do that for each other.
- Thank you.
We was really balling tonight, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- Such teamwork.
Mm-hmm.
Ooh.
That feels good.
Yes, that was one... velvety smooth game.
I just get so stiff sometimes after the game.
Do you?
- I'm starting to.
- Hmm?
I'm starting to get stiff right here.
Right there.
- It's catching up with you?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks, girl.
I appreciate it.
- My pleasure.
- You want me to put a little bit on you?
- Where?
No.
I'm fine.
I'm just cool.
I'll just sit here and hit the old hay.
Good night, Mr. Romeo.
You just so fine.
- Don't leave home without him, huh?
- You got that right.
He goes wherever I go.
You think Romeo takes your picture when he goes on the road?
Hell, I'm sure of it.
I glued it to the inside of his suitcase.
I'm just saying, uh, I know Romeo's a man... and I do know men, if you know what I mean.
All I'm saying is, girl, I trust my man.
Do you love him?
Look, Juwanna, I've never not had someone, and... even with the doubts, which I'm not gonna lie, there are some... it's better than being alone.
I'm not so sure about that, Michelle.
Oh, wow.
Look at these tomatoes.
They're looking good, Aunt Ruby.
Uh-huh.
Hey, baby, how did it go?
It went great, Aunt Ruby.
The game was off the hook.
I was off the hook.
They gave me the game ball.
And, Aunt Ruby...
I really think Michelle and I-- we're getting tight.
Oh!
You like her, do you?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I think I do.
- And she likes you?
- Well, she will.
I just got to keep working it.
She just starting to get into me.
- Get into you.
- Yep.
Have you lost your mind?
- What?
- You a man posing as a woman.
She don't want you.
She wants a girlfriend.
The second she find out you got a extra piece of equipment between your legs... what you think she gonna do?
Juwanna, I have been looking all over for you.
We've got a table right over there.
What's the matter?
You don't like my outfit, huh?
I told my girl this Pebbles do--
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?
- It's just-
- You look so beautiful tonight.
Thank you, Juwanna.
How sweet.
What do you mean, "Thank you"?
What ever happened to "Same to you"?
Oh.
I'm sorry, girl.
Same to you.
You looking good, girl.
- That's what I thought.
- Puff gonna love you in that dress.
- What? "Puff'?
I don't smoke.
- Puff.
You remember.
Over there.
Romeo's friend?
- You remember him.
Look.
- Oh, my Lord.
You did not just set me on a date with that Carolina river cricket.
- I thought I was doing you a favor.
- You call that a favor?
- He really likes you, girl.
- He can start liking somebody else.
- I'm up out of here.
- Juwanna, please don't leave.
I promised to Romeo that I'd hook you guys up... and it would really mean a lot to me if you would stay.
Please.
For me?
- Be nice.
I found her.
- I'm gonna try my best.
- How you doing, Juwanna?
- How are you, Mr. Romeo?
Well, well, well.
- If it isn't Juwanna Mann.
- How you doing, little Puffy?
All good.
I have to admit you are looking so hot tonight.
Sss!
Whew!
- Thank you.
- Let me "ax" you something.
- What do you wanna "ax" me?
- Did it hurt?
- Did what hurt?
- When you... fell from heaven.
Hallelujah!
It's called the bird.
Watch the wings.
Let's have a seat.
Let's have a good evening, huh?
I got the chair.
Sit on--
Good evening, folks.
Would you like to hear the specials?
Don't wanna hear any specials.
Just get me a Cosmos, heavy on the vodka... and just keep pouring 'em and pouring 'em till your arms get tired.
- I'll have a glass of champagne, sir.
- Hold up.
Hold up.
My man, bring a bottle of your best champagne for the table.
Yeah,yeah, bet that.
And some "scrawberries' and some "scrimp'cocktail.
Have we decided on dinner or do you need some more time?
- Don't need any more time.
- Ah, ah, ah.
Stymie that.
That's when you going country.
Country got you crazy
O-7-3-5-7!
The young lady wants a fil-let mig-non.
You know, little hunk of meat, little pink on the inside.
Fil-let mig-non
How do you like it How do you like it
- I'll have the, uh--
- I'll have the snapper.
- Girl, you on fire tonight.
I like it though.
I like it like that.
- I'm gonna run off to the little ladies' room.
- I'd better go with you.
No, no, no.
- Well, the restroom's right back there.
- I can do this.
You know, that could be us out there, right?
- Hey, hey, hey!
Back your ass up.
Yo, Puff, let me holler at you for a second.
Yo, check it out.
Take the keys.
Take my car.
Look like I'm gonna be kickin' it here.
You kids be safe, if you know what I mean.
Funk.
Nice crib, young lady.
- You mind if I got something to drink?
- I ran out.
- How about if I use your bathroom?
- It's broken.
I'm mighty tired.
You mind if I crash on the couch?
Don't have one.
- You mind if I use the phone?
- Listen to me.
My line's dead.
Just cut the crap.
You're not getting into my house.
You don't need to come into my house.
You don't need to use the bathroom.
You can't sleep on my couch.
I don't need you to checking for any burglars.
And I don't have any aspirins for your fake headache.
I'll tell you what.
You're not getting inside of me or my house.
So you and little Puffy can just get to steppin'.
Get to steppin'.
- How about a little kiss?
- I ain't giving you no little-
- Eew!
Giving you no little kiss.
All right, then, good night.
But you know I could use a little sugar.
I--
That's what you can use.
That's exactly what you can use.
Well, I guess no means no.
You're just a big ol' man.
Now give me a big ol' hug.
Go right on over there.
Now, what is your name?
Jerry, you're gonna get one "To My Friend Jerry." There you are.
Juwanna Mann.
What's up?
Oh, my God.
Aren't you getting dizzy?
We rock the house tonight
The Banshees
We'll have a good ol' time
The Banshees
It feels right The Banshees
We ain't been here six hours and already you got some meat sending you flowers.
You move that fast on the court, you'd be league MVP about now.
Are you two done?
'Cause they're not even for me.
They're for Miss Juwanna.
Ooh.
Give 'em here before you wilt 'em.
Let's just see who they from.
Can I read my own card, Lizard?
Let's see now.
"Roses are red, violets are not...
"I can't wait to see what you've got.
Love, Puff Smokey Smoke."
He your baby's daddy He your baby's daddy
He's your mother's sister.
Oh, Juwanna.
Oh, please.
Trust me.
Puffy's not my type.
Anybody who sends me roses is definitely my type.
Hell, bitch, someone passes you the salt, he's your type.
Lizard, that's cold.
I'm gonna tell you ladies what my type is.
Somebody who sends you flowers for no reason at all.
You know?
Just because it's Wednesday or whatever.
And that's special.
Yeah.
- That's the kind of guy you hold on to.
- Well,you know what I like?
I like it when a man tells you... you're the most beautiful girl in the world.
-Aw, girl.
- Oh, Lord.
I hate to burst your bubble, Mother Teresa... but a man would tell you anything to tap that ass.
You got that right.
I'm gonna let you guys in on a little secret.
It's not that I'm easy or anything.
It's just you got to trust me on this.
The key to men is breaking through that little code they have... that little double-talk.
And what about when they take a baby girl out to dinner... talk about you can eat whatever you want, money's no object?
All that means is, if I'm spending this kind of money on your gut... when I get home, I want some of baby girl's-
- That's all that is.
And y'all all know the Mack Daddy line of them all.
Now, say it with me.
"I promise, baby...
I will call you tomorrow."
- Amen, girl!
- Hallelujah!
And what about when some men like to brag about the size of their manhood?
When we know it ain't the size of the boat, baby, but the motion of the ocean.
Can I get a "hallelujah"?
Can't get a "hallelujah"?
What you talking about, Juwanna?
The size of the boat don't matter.
- I want the Titanic.
- You got that right!
All right, ladies, listen up.
No practice today.
Cool!
All right!
The team has a new insurance policy... so each one of you needs to take a new physical.
Come on, y'all.
Let's go knock this out real quick.
Juwanna Mann?
When was your last period?
My last period.
Okay, I had a game three days ago... and I played the whole game.
- So two periods.
- Oh, no, no.
You crack me up.
No, be serious.
Your menstrual period.
Oh.
Oh.
Um-
- Um--
Menstruation period.
Let's see here.
Last Thursday.
Yes, I think I unplugged last Thursday.
And any signs of gonorrhea, syphilis or chlamydia?
- Don't have any sisters.
Am I done yet, Doc?
- No, no, no.
I need for you to disrobe, and I'll step right outside... and I'll be back in just a few minutes.
Excuse me.
You want me to take off everything?
Every little stitch.
Miss Mann.
- Everything all right in there?
- I'll be right there, Doc.
Miss Mann.
I'm coming in, Miss Mann.
Bam!
I must be in the wrong locker room.
You can't go in there.
Mr. Daniels is a very busy man.
Who do you think you are?
Oh.
Betty, it's okay.
It's fine.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Betty.
Thank you, Betty.
Wow.
A third career.
Where the hell do you find the time?
I'm telling you right now.
I'm through.
I'm finished with this.
I'm out.
- I'm getting out.
- Okay, all right.
Have you checked with Juwanna on that?
I don't need to ask Juwanna.
I am Juwanna.
I just left a doctor who was about five minutes away... from a handful of Juwanna's nuts.
All right.
I just thought you might wanna run it by her... because, well, considering all the offiers I've been flooded with.
I don't think you're hearing me.
What do you mean, "offers"?
Reebok, Coca-Cola, Sports Illustrated for Women.
Yeah, it turns out that Juwanna... is every advertiser's dream come true.
She's easy to get along with... considerate of others, a real team player... pretty much everything you're not.
So, really, all you have to do is jump on board... with any one of these advertisers... you'll be making more money as Juwanna than you ever dreamed of as Jamal.
You're not getting it.
You're just not getting it.
I don't care about all that anymore.
Listen.
I did this for one reason, and I did it for one reason only.
I did it so Jamal Jeffries can get back into pro ball, man.
I wanna be back with my team, and that was it.
That's it.
Then I'll tell you that the network is pressuring the commissioner... and you're probably gonna get another hearing.
In the meantime, you might consider taking advantage of the Juwanna train... while the railroad is still in business.
You might wanna stop worrying about Juwanna so much... and worry about Lorne, 'cause this is about saving your career too.
Romeo.
My baby sleeping.
- Romeo?
- That's my name, baby.
That's my name.
- Romeo?
Hold on, baby.
I'm almost finished.
Romeo!
Who are you in my bed?
What are you doing in my house?
Baby, hold up.
It ain't me.
Groupies.
Hel--
- Hello.
- Juwanna, it's Michelle.
- I need to talk to you.
- Girl, why are you crying?
I knew you wanted me.
I knew it was just a matter of time, baby.
What you want?
Six, five, four... three, two, one.
Happy New Year!
You see that, Michelle?
Being alone doesn't mean you have to be lonely.
Juwanna, how come I couldn't see what Romeo was doing behind my back?
It was probably the glare off Puff Smokey's teeth.
I know.
I know.
- It hurts like crazy now, sweetheart.
- Bad.
But you trust me.
You are so much better off.
I just hate being wrong.
Don't you go blaming yourself for this.
No, you don't.
You don't blame yourself for that low-down dirty snake.
Sweetheart, some men just don't realize what they've got till it's gone.
Now, you trust me.
One day he's gonna know.
Thanks.
Juwanna, you are such a good friend.
That's why I like you, 'cause you just keep it real.
You know?
No perpetrating with you.
You're just you.
- Actually, Michelle, there's something--
- And you know what else?
I'm gonna quit all of this crying and trippin'... and I'm just gonna move on.
- That's it.
Move right on.
- Yeah.
Let's have some more wine.
Michelle, I really need to tell you something.
I'm really hoping the playoffs can take my mind offi of things... 'cause you and the team are all that I plan on focusing on right now.
'Cause we got a really good chance of winning the championship this year.
Especially now, since we got you, dog.
Jamal.
Okay, it's all set.
Between the network, the players' union and my shameless groveling... we got you a meeting with the commissioner.
- That's great.
What do I have to do?
- Just show up, be polite, smile.
Let me do all the talking, pretty much like I'm doing now...
- and you're back in the league.
- Sounds good to me.
When is it?
- Tomorrow, 3:00.
- Wait a minute, Lorne.
You know I can't make that.
The Banshees start the playoffs tomorrow.
Well, you know what?
How about if my office tapes the game for you?
Yeah, but they're expecting Juwanna to play.
And I'm expecting Juwanna to disappear.
We got a deal here.
What am I busting my ass for?
Come on now.
Understand, will you?
There's a lot of people involved.
Yeah, Lorne, including Juwanna.
There are a lot of people counting on Juwanna too.
Jamal.
You're scaring me now with this.
I just need a minute, Lorne.
The fans are filing in with great anticipation... as the Charlotte Banshees prepare to host game one... of their WUBA playoff series against the Houston Gallop.
Yo, has anybody seen Juwanna?
Jeanne, this should really be an exciting playoff series.
You're right, Chris.
Even though these two teams are pretty evenly matched... most people expect the Banshees to win the series.
But in order to do that, they're gonna need a huge performance... by their star player, Juwanna Mann.
And we're gonna find out for real when they tip it off in just about 30 minutes.
- Hello.
- Hey, look.
It's me.
Can we, uh-- Can we reschedule the meeting?
No, we don't.
We're not rescheduling the meeting.
Let me make this real clear for you.
You're not here in five minutes, you're not gonna play in the league ever again.
This is it.
You understand me?
Oh, really?
Yeah, I understand.
That was him.
He's on his way.
Nothing to worry about, Mr. Commissioner.
What's it gonna be, boy?
You got to go somewhere.
And now introducing the starting lineup... for your Charlotte Banshees.
- I tried calling her.
- I don't believe this.
- Where she at?
- I don't know.
You know what it is I'm thinking?
Traffic.
Yeah, it's, uh--
It's always-- Down, you know, here it's bad.
Number 22...
Juwanna Mann.
Hey.
Where you been?
I had a friend that had some problems.
- Now let's kick some butt.
- All right.
Let's do this.
Come on.
Let's get in here.
Huddle up.
I guess some things never change.
No, you're wrong about that.
The moment we've been waiting for is finally here.
We are underway.
Ball.
Go, girls!
Yeah!
I've lost my mind!
- Way to go, Michelle.
- Good pass, baby.
Good pass.
- Right here, baby.
Right here.
- Move!
Move!
Move!
Things remain tight here.
The Gallop and the Banshees are playing equally so far.
They've been trading basket for basket,yet the Gallop holding a slim lead for the moment.
It's been that kind of game, but we should have a wild finish.
Juwanna Mann!
Juwanna Mann!
With just nine seconds left, the Banshees are down by one.
There's the steal.
The ball is stolen by Juwanna Mann.
Look at Juwanna Mann go.
Could Juwanna Mann possibly slam-dunk this ball?
Yes!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
Whoo-hoo.
Yes!
Yes.
I can't believe what I'm seeing here.
It's Jamal Jeffries.
And that's your play of the day.
It don't make me no difference.
I still love you, Juwanna Mann.
I love you, Juwanna Mann!
Juwanna Mann.
I love you, even though I guess--
You're still a man.
I'm-
- Does that make me a man?
Juwanna!
Juwanna.
The hell is happening to me?
Hold on, Michelle.
I can explain, all right?
Just give me a minute.
Michelle.
Michelle.
Damn.
In perhaps the most bizarre sports story ever... women's pro basketball star, Juwanna Mann... has turned out to be exactly what her name implies-- a man.
He a sicko.
Straight-up sicko.
No comment.
Excuse me.
No comment.
Excuse me.
In my country, penis okay.
My mother have penis.
The WUBA's Charlotte Banshees have fired Jamal Jeffiries for posing as a woman.
The WUBA's Charlotte Banshees have fired Jamal Jeffiries for posing as a woman.
The odd thing is, Jeffiries is known for being a big playboy.
The team said they became suspicious when they caught him hitting on himself.
In fact-- In fact, he could--
Since the opening tip, the Charlotte Banshees really have been struggling.
They have not looked very smooth offiensively here.
Jamal, Jamal, Jamal.
I see you moping around.
I see you down in the dumps.
I also see you ain't been using no plates in this room.
You got yourself quite a mess here.
I'll clean it up.
I'm not talking about this mess.
I'm talking about that mess.
Sit up.
Scoot over.
It's no sense in crying over spilt milk
Best thing to do is start looking for a paper towel.
You hear me?
Huh?
- Next.
- Damn.
It appears the Banshee fans are just as disheartened as the players.
Well, Chris, I would absolutely have to agree with you.
And unlike the Gallop, this Phoenix Web team, they have a lot of game.
The Banshees need to turn this around now.
Otherwise, they are gonna get blown out and they will not advance to the finals.
Brought my A-game today.
Let's pick it up, guys.
Can you handle that?
Second half.
That's what I wanna see.
What's the matter with you guys?
Huh?
Coach, face it.
We're never gonna get to the championship without Jamal.
That's not true.
What you doing here?
This is the ladies' locker room, perv.
I just wanna talk to you guys, all right?
- Oh, please.
- You ain't got nothing to say.
All right, ladies, hold up.
I think we're letting Mr. Jeffiries offi a little easy by throwing him out.
Let's listen to what he has to say.
I think we all wanna hear this.
Guys, look, uh...
I messed up, all right?
What I did it was-- it was wrong, it was selfish... and I'm--
I'm truly sorry.
When I first got here, I got to tell you...
I thought women's basketball was a big joke.
Hell, I thought anything that wasn't about Jamal Jeffiries was a big joke.
Turns out the joke was on me.
That's because I thought that the most important thing about basketball... was being a star.
That's until you guys taught me the only way to truly shine... was to be a part of a team.
So if you guys wanna hate me... and Lord knows I understand you if you do.
But you're gonna have to hate me after the game... because you guys never needed me to win this... and you don't need me now.
I needed you.
So come on.
Go win it.
And, Latisha.
Your game is on.
Keep an eye out for Magda.
She's getting open in the post.
I don't know what happened in that locker room at halftime... but the Banshee team is playing with tremendous emotion.
-Somehow they've been rejuvenated.
- Well, Chris,you're right.
This is like a completely diffierent team.
What an amazing turnaround.
Don't look now, but the Banshees might actually get to the big show.
We're winners!
Dear Michelle--
Just 'cause it's Wednesday.
The fans deserve to have a true basketball star... and a future role model finish his career on top.
Please believe me when I tell you that Mr. Jeffiries is a changed man.
And I say that, not only as his agent... but as his friend too.
Mr. Jeffiries, after hearing the very sincere... and impassioned plea from your representative...
I must say that I am still left rather unimpressed.
You have not only disgraced our men's pro league... but the women's pro league as well.
This is a closed hearing.
With all due respect, sir, and on behalf of the Charlotte Banshees... we in no way feel that Jamal Jeffries has disgraced our league.
Without a doubt, he may have disgraced himself... and he is certainly paying the price for that.
- But we forgive him.
- No doubt, no doubt.
We feel that you should too.
We want you to have this, Jamal.
I'm convinced.
I think they've made their point.
We out of here, y'all.
And now, returning for his second year at starting guard... the only man who has played in both the men's... and women's professional basketball leagues...
North Carolina's own...
Jamal Jeffiries.
- Hey, you, you!
- What, man?
That's not a keg.
You know how much this stupid thing costs?
What does it matter to you?
The bank owns it now anyway.
The bank?
The bank owns this?
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?
The bank's got a dustpan in the kitchen.
Maybe you need to get that too.
What's up, baby?
Yeah.
You look like an angel in this light.
- Give it to me.
- Mark.
Yo, man, what's up?
I just saw you on the television, man.

- Damn.
-Mr.Jeffries. Mr.Jeffries.
Can I please have your autograph?
Yeah.
Sure, kid.
Ricky.
A stamp?
You're welcome, kid.
Stay in school.
Be like Jamal.
Anothermonsterdunk by Jam-all.
The kid is on fire tonight.
Kenny, that's what I'm talking about.
That six-game suspension did him some good.
His mind is right.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
- Come and get some of this, boy.
- What you got, smurf?
What you got, big smurf?
Huh?
Huh?
Bam!
Somebody catch me.
Did I come down on you?
If you had a little bit more game, maybe you wouldn't be crying.
If you were just a little taller.
A little bit taller.
Here we go again.
- What's up with that, man?
- I'm supposed to let you through?
- Is that five?
- Yep.
Here's the problem.
That's five fouls on Jam-all.
One more, he's done.
That'd set a team record for disqualifications.
- Hearn, get in there for Jeffries.
- Ref, I was going for the ball.
You need to watch the game.
You're missing a good one.
-Jamal, you out, man.
I got you.
- I ain't going nowhere.
- Go tap somebody else.
- Time out!
- Time out!
I was born with it, baby.
Don't be jealous.
Don't be jealous.
-Jamal, you're out.
- What do you mean I'm out?
I'm out?
I'm out of what, Coach?
What you gonna do, fire me?
I'm the head coach.
I call the shots.
Wait.
Hold on.
You may call the shots, but I'm making all the shots.
Coach, you see that?
Look at that scoreboard.
That's me, bro.
All me.
You may be coach of this damn team, but I "am" the team.
There isn't a team in this league that wouldn't kill to have a player like me.
- They can have you.
- Yeah?
And you can have this...
Coach.
Yeah, boo you.
You want something to boo about?
Huh?
How about this?
- Yeah, boo you too.
- Boo!
Yeah, yeah, boo you.
Yeah, boo you.
This is the most disgusting display of unsportsmanlike conduct I have ever seen.
How about this?
- Oh, Lord.
- Change that to second most.
- Ha!
- Oh, my God.
You like it.
You like it, don't you, ladies?
How you like me now?
Last night Beat guard JamalJeffries... gave the fans much more than they bargained for... when he decided to get ready for the showers a little early at the Charlotte Coliseum.
Say hello to my little friend.
How you like me now?
I don't know what the big deal is.
We are all born naked.
I like being naked.
Don't you like being naked?
J.J., he sort of lost it tonight, but, hey, it happens.
I think we as professional athletes got to be role models to the kids... because they look up to us in the community.
Yo, Rasheed,you suck.
Well, say it to my face then, chump.
Whatever the league decides to do in this case... they won't get an argument from us.
The commissioner of basketball will be having a press conference later... to announce what penalties the league will be imposing.
We were able to get the reaction of Jamal's agent.
I spoke with Jamal earlier today... and, naturally, he's feeling quite remorseful... regarding his losing control.
I happen to know, in fact, that at this very moment... he's quietly reflecting on his inappropriate behavior.
Mmmmmmmmmm....
Ow!
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Whoo!
I love this game, baby!
What's up?
What's up in here?
Having a good time?
Everybody having a good time?
- I ain't groovin' unless I got three booties.
- Throw your hands up!
Throw your hands up!
- Mm-mm-mm.
Look at that, out there with the three skankateers.
Girl, I don't know how you put up with that.
Honey, all these tricks is dogs.
But if you have to sleep in a doghouse, it might as well look like this one.
True.
- Work it!
Work it!
Hey, hey, hey!
I know you hear the phone!
You see me talkin' business.
Get the phone.
Go get the phone!
I ain't deaf.
I got to rethink cloning.
Uhh!
Yeah!
- Phone call.
- What do you want me to do?
I'm busy.
Tell 'em I'm not here.
- Sorry, Aunt Ruby, but Jamal can't come to the phone--
- Aunt Ruby?
Out.
Y'all heard me.
Out.
Boy, what in the world is the matter with you?
Have you lost your mind?
Have you plum lost your mind?
- I was ready to call you--
- Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to you.
- I know, but I'm--
- I said don't interrupt me.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sitting here last night, watching the game with my girlfriends... and the next thing I know I'm looking at your naked butt cheeks.
I read the TV guide,Jamal, and nowhere did it say... that I would see my nephew Jamal's scrawny ass on channel 1( at (:00.
I know, Aunt Ruby, but--
You think you can carry on any ol' way, any ol' how just 'cause you feel like it?
Answer me when I'm talking to you, boy!
- But you just told me not to interrupt.
- I don't care what I said.
- Wait a minute.
Is that music I hear over there?
- You having a party?
- No.
That stupid girl got her TV up.
Are you-
- You know what?
I'm not gonna raise my blood pressure... and get upset over this nonsense.
Calm down.
- Yeah, take a deep breath.
- Oh, Lord.
They talking about you on television,JJ.
- They talking about me on TV?
- Is there an echo on this phone?
Yeah!
- Turn it on!
I got to go!
- Hello?
The league has had enough.
Professional basketball can no longer sit idly by... and watch its players undermine the integrity of this game.
As of today,Jamal Jeffries is suspended, indefinitely.
No more questions, please.
Hey, don't worry about all that, y'all.
This is all gonna blow over.
You know how it is.
It's just the man trying to hold a brother down.
You know how they do it.
Pro basketball needs JamalJeffries.
This is gonna blow over.
Blow over.
Trust me.
No, Friday's no good for me.
No, Friday's no good for me.
You know what?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
My client from Chippendale's just showed up.
Yeah, all right.
Bye-bye.
Hey,Jamal.
What's up, baby?
Shoot me straight.
I talked to the Beat about an hour ago and they've dropped your contract.
Well, too bad for the Beat.
They can drop all they want.
My stuff is guaranteed.
Jamal's contract's guaranteed.
"Was" guaranteed.
Yeah.
There's a little thing in the contract called a morals clause... and since, well, you don't seem to have any... the contract becomes null and his trusty sidekick void.
So you the sidekick, right?
Then earn your money and get on the horn.
Shop me around to other teams.
Come on, Tonto.
Let's go.
That's pretty much how I spent my entire day.
Talked to every team, every single team.
Nobody wants you.
You know why?
You're a head case.
Well, then bump 'em.
Bump 'em all.Jamal don't need them.
Send me to Europe.
I like foreign women.
And you know, not a bad idea.
Unfortunately, though, it turns out... they call it the "worldwide web" for a reason.
- That's your ass.
- Forget that.
What about the CBA?
What about the Globetrotters?
- I mean, something.
- Globetrotters.
That'd be fun.
No.
Nobody wants you, not even the Clippers.
- I thought you were my friend, Lorne.
- See, now, that's a problem.
I'm not your friend.
I'm your agent.
I was your agent.
That also is null and void.
Wait.
What are you saying?
Now you're not gonna be my agent?
Yeah, it's over.
I can't be your agent.
That's silly.
But I certainly wish you luck.
I do.
And here's hoping you invested your money wisely...
- 'cause I don't see any fresh cash coming in any time soon.
-Ahh!
Don't even need to hear it.
Bling.
JamalJeffries's got plenty cash.
So don't you worry about me.
Okay?
JamalJeffries is set, baby.
Set.
Broke?
What the hell do you mean I'm broke?
You ain't got no more money, dog.
Chapter 11 .
Chapter 11?
What happened to the first ten chapters?
- Are you stupid?
No money, man.
- Tell me, Mr. Business Manager...
- what you been doing with all my money?
- You spent it all.
- I spent it all?
- That's right.
You spent it all.
- I did?
- Maybe you got too many furs.
- Why didn't you try to stop me?
- Tried to do that, bro.
- You did?
- I sure did.
Yo, Tina!
Yo, baby, everything gonna be all right.
It sho' is.
You still got a little modeling left in you.
It'll be chump change compared to what I used to bring in... but it'll get us by until the commissioner comes to his senses.
Come on, baby.
Where you at?
I'm in the bedroom.
I'll be out in a minute.
Yeah, well, come on.
Ain't that much makeup in the world.
You know I had a rough couple of days.
You ought to be rubbing a brother down.
The Banshees!
- Losing all control.
-And they're back.
I'm prepare to rumble.
Are you?
- Get your tickets today.
- I'll rumble with you.
I'll rumble with you all night long.
- Women's basketball.
What a joke.
-Jamal, I'm leaving.
Okay.
While you're out, why don't you pick a brother up something to eat.
I'm--
Baby, what you doing?
That's the good luggage.
Don't make it easy on 'em.
Put this--
- What is that?
- My stuff.
I'm leaving you.
What do you mean you leaving?
The only reason why I stayed with your lyin', cheating' ass... is because you were rich and famous.
- But now you're neither, so what's the point?
- What are you talking about?
What about all the good lovin' you was getting up in here?
I packed it.
The batteries too.
Good-bye,Jamal.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Yeah, you try to come back... you're gonna have to start at the bottom of the list.
Yeah,yeah,yeah.
That's why I'm leaving your broke ass.
Yeah, plus your feet stink!
All right, listen to me.
You wanna win this thing, it's real simple.
You go inside and you act like an adult.
That's all.
If you forget what that is, just look around the room at everybody else.
Hold on here.
I am calm, Loren.
I am cool.
And I am ready to collect my checks.
Damn, I look good.
Mr.Jeffries, you have clearly embarrassed the league, your team... and I certainly hope you've embarrassed yourself.
What is it you're here to say to me today?
Uh, I'm here to say that--
I'm here to say that-- that what I did was wrong, and, uh...
I sincerely, uh--
I am-- I'm sincerely--
He apologizes, sir.
He is very apologetic.
This is not your arbitration hearing, Mr. Daniels.
May I remind you it's your client's.
He is the one with the oversized ego... that may be eclipsing his talent at this point.
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hold, Colonel Sanders.
Hold on.
- Mm!
Excuse me. "Oversized ego eclipsing his talent?"
Perhaps you haven't seen my game in a while, Pops.
Maybe you need to trim some of them mother-- bushes off your-- head.
You'd be able to see my mother-- game.
Don't try to give me no shit.
- Take that.
What you got, baby?
- I'm gonna show you what I got.
I'm gonna show you what I got right now.
You still ain't saying nothing.
- Ooh!
Jamal, you holding up the game.
- Here.
- Esther.
Uh, Esther, it's on you.
- Come on, You old biddy.
play your card.
- This bra is killing me.
You's a fine-lookin' young man.
Ooh!
Damn!
Okay, that's it.
I've-- I've had enough of the bridge club.
You ain't playing no more?
No, no.
Oh.
I need to go outside for some air.
Why,J.J.?
There's a CNN report that says... too much inside air is-is deadly.
While you're going outside... make yourself useful and pick up some groceries for the morning.
I ain't gonna fetch no groceries.
I don't do that no more, Aunt Ruby.
I'm a professional ballplayer.
I'm a star.
You a what?
You heard me.
I'm a star.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Hurry back with them groceries, star.
Gonna talk back to me in my own house.
Your house?
I was the one bought you the house.
You better get out of here.
Crazy ass.
- Man, what happened?
- What you doing?
Can't pass.
Hey, y'all, it's Jamal Jeffries.
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yeah.
Sure, kid.
- Where's your stupid stamp?
- Ooh!
- What?
- You heard me.
Thought you were hot stuff, didn't you?
But look at you now.
Look where your nasty attitude's gotten you.
- Girl, I'll take this--
- Whatever.
Why don't you just go ahead and pass me the ball, if you still know how.
Ooh!
Ooh!
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"Yeah" that.
What you got, boy?
Come on.
What you got?
What you got?
Boo-yah!
How you like me now?
Lorne Daniels, please.
Tell him it's Kobe Bryant looking for a new agent.
There you are, Lorne.
Jamal.
- You can't stop me.
- Don't hang up.
Listen to me.
I'm calling to tell you about a phenomenal basketball player I just met.
Why?
Because you were good to me and I wanna be good to you.
Listen to me.
This is the greatest basketball player you've ever seen.
And get this, Lorne, it's a girl.
That's right.
A girl.
She a little rough around the edges 'cause she's straight up from the country.
Get me Coach Rivers on the phone, immediately.
Immediately!
- Yeah.
- Time to get paid.
- It's time to get paid.
Time to get paid.
- Time to get-- get paid.
- Ah, yeah.
Uh!
Uh!
- Get paid.
Get paid, baby.
Get paid.
Time to get paid.
Time to get paid.
Jamal, what are you doing?
Um, I'm, um, trying on your clothes, Aunt Ruby.
Yeah, I gather that, but what are you doing?
I know this look freaky, Aunt Ruby, but it's not what you think.
Well, it can't get much better than what I think.
Jamal, there's no way I'm helping you do this.
- Aunt Ruby-
- Aunt Ruby, please.
- Mm-mmm.
Boy, get up off your knees in my pants.
Aunt Ruby!
Jamal, when you were in the sixth grade... who was there for you when you traded your little baby cousin...
- for a new pair of basketball shoes?
- You were there, Aunt Ruby.
You were there for me, but I need you.
I was there, helped you through it, didn't ask no questions... didn't pass no judgments, but this--
Boy, don't you give me them puppy dog eyes.
- Aunt Ruby, you have to help me.
You got to help me.
- Uh-uh.Jamal, no!
Are you watching?
Are you watching?
Good shot.
Good shot.
That's what I'm talking about.
Way to break it down.
Lorne, practice is almost over.
I think your blind date just stood you up.
Looks that way,Jennifer.
Coach.
Sorry.
Listen.
It's all my fault.
I trusted somebody.
I should've known better--
- I'm here!
- Hold up.
Uh, Latisha.
Guard her.
I hope your game's as tight as your ass.
Girl, I chase chickens quicker than you.
I hope you can make that ball bounce like them titties of yours.
-Just keep your eyes on me.
- Come on with it.
There you go.
Boom!
Sweet.
Come on.
Let's go.
Here I go.
And... boom!
- That costs money.
- Come on, girls!
- Ball!
Ball!
- Ball what?
Too easy.
- Yeah.
- Where did you find her?
I heard about her from a friend.
- Ball!
- I got her!
Damn.
You made me miss.
That's blocking.
What?
Oh, please.
You got to be kidding me.
She made me miss it.
Blocking.
Ladies, that's it.
Nice job.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Uh, so, why don't you call me in the morning... and maybe we can work something out.
Yeah.
Thanks, Coach.
What's your name anyway, hotshot?
- I don't know myself.
What is it?
- Let's get pizza.
You wanna?
-Ju--Juwanna.
-Juwanna?
- Yes.Juwanna, man.
-Juwanna Mann, Coach Rivers.
- It's great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Coach.
- You all right?
- Yo, I'm straight.
- No, you not.
- And you must be Lorne.
- That's right.
-Jamal's told me so much about you.
- Really?
Didn't tell me you were so cute though.
Juwanna!
How's my favorite girl?
Come on in.
Sit down.
- Oh, why, thank you, Mr. Daniels.
- Please, call me Lorne.
You should be on a first-name basis with the man who's about to change your life.
- Oh, really?
Gonna change my life?
-Absolutely.
I don't know how I did it.
Well, that's not completely true.
This here is a one-year contract for you with the Charlotte Banshees.
- Oh, my Lord, are you kidding me?
- No.
- Oh, my Lord!
- Mm-hmm.
- Am I dreaming?
- No, you're not dreaming.
Go ahead.
Pinch yourself.
I'll wait.
This is the first time in my life I've ever been speechless.
That is the beauty of signing a contract.
There's no speech really required.
So just go ahead and sign there.
Don't I need to get a lawyer to take a look at this thing before I sign it?
Of course not.
These contracts are completely standard at this point.
All the hard work's been done by me.
Just go ahead and sign.
I guess it's better than playing in the parks.
- It certainly is.
Right here.
- Right here?
And here.
And here.
Juwanna.Juwanna.Juwanna.
That's a lovely signature.
Congratulations,Juwanna.
You are about to become the newest member... of the Charlotte Banshees.
- Whee-ee!
I am so excited.
All in one day I'm starting a whole new life... and I have my very own big-time agent.
Oh, I don't want you to just think of me as your agent.
I'm also your friend.
Oh, that is so sweet, Lorne.
And I don't want you to only think of me as just your client... because I am also your ex-client, biatch.
- Got you, didn't I?
- Oh, shit.
Give me the fax.
Give it to me.
- Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Come on.
- Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Daniels.
Mr.--
- Give it to me.
- Mr. Daniels.
Mr. Daniels!
- Your wife is on line three.
- Tell her I'm with a client, will you?
Okey-dokey.
- God, this is great!
- Uh-huh.
- Got your ass.
Got your ass!
- Betty.
Betty.
Betty!
I want you to get Coach Rivers on the line immediately, as in right now!
All right, okay.
When Coach Rivers gets on the phone, tell her the whole truth.
Okay.
I will.
I'll tell her.
I'll say, "Coach Rivers, yeah--
and trick you into signing me."
That's not at all the truth.
I had nothing to do with this.
What do you mean you had nothing to do with it?
All I did was tell you about a phenomenal basketball player, and what did you do?
You set up the tryouts, you negotiated the contract, you brokered the deal, baby.
You kind of created me.
You're Frankenstein.
Oh, God.
No, no, no.
No, this is crazy.
- No one's gonna believe you're a woman.
- You did.
- This is blackmail.
- No, it's not.
This is black fe-male.
- That's not funny.
- What do you expect me to do?
Basketball is the only thing I really know how to do.
And I have to make a living.
So until you figure out how to get me back with my team... you can just look for me in the women's locker room, baby.
The women's locker room, checking out booties.
Checking out booties.
- Basketball booties.
-Jamal.
I thought we were friends.
Oh.
Now, see, there's a problem.
You're not my friend, Lorne.
Remember?
You're my agent.
Thanks to you, Lorne, I'm gonna be a Charlotte Banshee.
You're better than Jerry Maguire.
Somebody kill me!
- Y'all ready for this?
- Who's ready to play?
Who's ready to win?
- Banshees!
- Ban--
- Shees!
- Ban--
- Shees!
Banshees!
It's the opening game of the WUBAseason.
Hi.
Welcome inside the Charlotte Coliseum.
Along with Jeanne Zelasko, I'm Chris Myers.
We have a terrific matchup for you today.
The Charlotte Banshees hosting the two-time defending champion, Houston Gallop.
With all-stars in the lineup like Michelle Langford and Natalie Kemper... you have to believe the Banshees have a great shot at beating the Gallop.
Jamal.
-Jamal.
-Juwanna.
- Lorne.
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise... for the singing of our national anthem.
Singing for us today is multi-platinum recording artist, Romeo.
You don't understand how excited I am.
My very first game.
I saw television cameras.
Did you know this game is being televised?
I sure did, and I'm still trying to figure out what's my best side.
- Here or my ass.
- I think--
- Promise me you'll try to fit in.
- I will try to fit in.
All right.
There is no dunking in this league.
I won't dunk.
I promise.
Relax.
It's not like I need to an"yw"ay.
I got to go.
Now, keep your head up.
Yeah.
Keep your boobs up.
For you.
- For my baby.
- How sweet.
- See you after the game?
- No doubt, baby.
That boy drop more shit than the bunny rabbit on Ex-Lax.
But she's so blind she can't see past his great, big ol' walking stick.
Ain't that right, girl?
- What's up, player?
- What's up, player player?
Give me some, player.
What's the deal, baby?
I'm just a squirrel in your world.
I see you're doing your thing.
- You're looking at something.
- Man, hot dogs and hamburgers, man.
She's all that and a baseball bat and a hot wheel track.
I'm telling you, brown sugar like D'Angelo.
That's what he was talking about-- right there.
Oh!
She gonna block me out, huh?
-She with it though.
- I know she with it.
Yeah, baby.
Drop it like it's hot.
All right!
Yeah!
That's all right, girl!
We get it next time, Natalie!
Hit.
Two shots.
Yeah, that's a nice girl there.
She a little naive though.
Foreigner.
Here on a visa from Oklahoma.
She gonna be a city girl before long.
She rooming with Sanchez.
That little hot tamale over there.
That girl get around.
Really?
How awful.
Awful.
Block out, Magda!
With that big-ass head, she could block out the sun.
I said block out, you Serbian knucklehead!
- Way to go!
- So, what's your story?
Me?
I like to keep it simple.
You give me a good book and a good bitch, I'm straight.
I like you.
Yes, Natalie!
Way to get in there!
Time out!
- Come on, Natalie!
- All right, Natalie!
All right, hotshot.
- Let's see what you got.
- All right, Coach.
Now you're coaching.
There has been a substitution, and the new player is number 22.
Chris, that is Juwanna Mann.
- Yo, you see that?
- That deserves a "wow."
Wrong.
Na-na-na-na.
Beer and a popcorn.
It's all right.
Okay.
The ball is stolen away.
What a move.
No!
No!
No!
Pass the ball!
Don't dunk!
The 360.
Another amazing shot.
Ain't nothing sexier than a woman with ball control.
All right!
Yes!
Pass the ball!
Pass the ball!
- Here I go!
Here I go!
You ready?
- Ball!
Ball!
It's mine!
Mine!
22, Offense.
22, hit.
Technical right here.
If y'all hadn't been playing like a bunch of little girls.
Coach, that girl has got to go.
You know she's the reason we lost the game.
- She wouldn't even let the ground touch the ball.
- I understand your frustration.
The woman has definitely got problems.
You got that right.
Her number-one problem is I'm not playing with her.
You're gonna have to.
We just got Natalie's MRI back.
She tore her ACL.
She's out for the rest of the season.
And I'm makingJuwanna her replacement.
What?
But she's nothing but a ball hog, Coach.
You're gonna talk to me about ball hog, "Miss I Got Game, I'm All That"?
- I wasn't as bad as her.
- Michelle, you need to step up.
You're captain of this team, and I'm expecting you to help me turn this woman around.
I'm in a messy situation.
I'm stuck, and, basically, we have no choice.
That was quite a performance you had out there today.
What, 15 points in the second half alone.
It was, but it would've been 16 if y'all would have just picked up the pace.
Listen to me.
I know I'm not the captain of this team yet.
But you guys wanna win, you're gonna have to find a way to get me the ball.
- What?
- I can't pass the thing to myself.
I probably could if I worked at it, but we're supposed to be a team.
- Teamwork.Just what we need to talk about.
- That's right.
Forget it.
Look.
You know, I'd love to work with you on your game, if you're up to it.
Go over the playbook with you... make sure you understand how the Banshees--
How you gonna work with me on my game when my game doesn't need any work?
Didn't you see it?
But I'll be more than happy to help you with a few pointers on "your" game.
I'll be really happy to do that-- Oh, my God.
Lord, what are you doing?
Taking a shower, Einstein.
Aren't you?
Hell, yes, I'll take a shower with-- shower soon as I get home.
I got to do it as soon as I get home.
I really can't take showers in public.
Things crawl up in you and you never find them.
Whatever.
Boy, I love this league.
What part of"don't draw attention to yourself' did you not understand?
Lorne, I'm sorry.
They were screaming and cheering for a brother-- a sister.
What was I supposed to do?
Play like a bitch?
Yes, play like a woman.
That was your plan.
- Calm down.
Chill out, man.
- You're right.
I got to calm down.
I'm overreacting.
Absolutely.
I'm not used to going to a game and praying that my client's boobs don't fall out!
You keep this up, I'm gonna be booking clowns at birthday parties.
That's your problem.
My problem is I need a shower.
I sweat more as a woman.
Jamal, please.
I'm fairly certain I can get you an arbitration hearing.
But until then, I need you to keep a low profile.
That's all.
- Okay.
- Can you do that?
I can do that, Lorne.
I'll keep a low profile.
I promise.
Damn, you're gonna have a heart attack if you keep that shit up.
- Yeah.
- I'm telling you.
Bye-bye, Lorne.
What a snake.
I knew it.
- Holler at ya.
- I'll holler at you too.
- Hold up, little girl.
Let me tell you something.
- Ooh!
You are one tall glass of water... and I'm telling you "scraight" up, I'm thirsty.
- What in the hell are you?
- You don't know who I am, do you?
- No, I don't.
Who are you?
- I am Puff Smokey Smoke.
You wanna kiss it, don't you?
That's right.
Uh-huh.
Rap extraordinaire.
I also sang background on Romeo's last album...
"Where There's Smoke There's Firestone."
Oh, really?
Well, you can sing backup for me right now.
Just back right on up.
Thank you very much, Mr. Puffer, but I have to go.
Drive careful now, baby... 'cause you are definitely precious cargo.
You ready?
You ready?
Pass the ball.Juwanna!
Juwanna.
What the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm sweating.
I'm breaking down the defense.
I'm wearing these chumps out, making all the shots.
Take your pick.
You know what?
Practice is over.
Michelle, don't leave.
Stick around.
This is about you and Juwanna.
Listen, missy.
I want you to take a look up here and tell me what you see.
What I see are a bunch of empty bleaches that I'm about to help you fill.
- That's what I see.
- Very funny.
You're a funny lady.
I see a sign that says the Charlotte Banshees.
My eyes are fine, Coach.
Because it says the Charlotte Banshees... and not the Charlotte Ju-wanna.
And if the Charlotte Banshees are gonna have any chance of winning this season...
I have to get my two strongest players here to try and work together.
Otherwise, we're screwed.
So, you're gonna play with Michelle here... one-on-one... and one-on-one and one-on-one and one-on-one.
Hey, how about one-on-one?
Until you start to get with the program.
You got it?
Yeah, I got it, Coach.
Mm!
- You ready for this?
- What you got?
Come on.
- You're gonna need a pen and paper.
- That's all right.
Come on.
- Are you ready?
- What you got?
Ooh!
Boom!
Sorry about that.
Oh!
Now, that's what I call an ass-ist.
Ha ha.
Ooh!
Boom!
That's game.
You really think you're something, don't you?
Well, I got it going on.
What can I say?
Born with it.
Here we go.
The jokes.
Look,Juwanna... this might be a joke to you, but it's not to me.
You got some big balls, don't you, girl?
Yeah, yeah, but all your arrogance and all of that showboatin'... that doesn't scare me, 'cause I know it's just a cover.
Because underneath, you don't trust anybody but yourself, girl.
And that's exactly where you gonna end up, by yourself... if you don't start to trust your team.
And we'll be right back with more of "Oprah." Are you done?
No.
Don't get me wrong.
You got mad skills.
You're good.
But one player can't win games by themselves.
We need teamwork.
- So you think I got skills?
- Yeah.
I'd like to be able to do some of them moves I saw you do.
- Wrap around.
- I'd sure like to show you some of them moves.
- What?
- I sure could show you some of those moves.
- It's real easy.
- Good.
See, now we talking.
I have never seen anybody pick up some moves quicker than you.
I have never seen anybody pick up some moves quicker than you.
- You were storming'.
- Well, you know.
You know.
- Romeo!
Hey!
- What's up, girl?
What you doing?
I couldn't roll through Atlanta without my baby.
-Juwanna, I got a ride.
- All right.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
You have some trouble there, little lady?
My door's just stuck.
You go right ahead.
I can handle this.
- I don't want you to strain yourself.
- That's what you get.
I guess you don't need no man's help after all.
- No, I don't need a man, but thank you.
- It's like that.
All right.
Hey,Juwanna, You wanna hang out tomorrow before our trip to New York?
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Cool.
-Just you and me, right?
- Yeah.
- It's a date.
- All right.
What's up, baby?
- See you later.
- Bye.
I can't stand him.
Bam!
- I got a little surprise for you.
- What is it?
I love surprises.
You do?
Good.
Because I have booked us for an entire day of beauty at the spa.
Spa?
So relaxing.
- I'm looking forward to this.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm looking forward to it too.
I'm feeling relaxed already.
Hi.
Oh, yes.
Where did you leave your wings, you angel you?
Oh, my God.
Lord.
Who are you?
Slow it down now.
Oh!
- Ooh!
Slow it down, sailor.
Ooh, Lord.
Ow!
Oh!
Is there a medic?
Ooh!
Thanks, Susie.
We'll see you next time.
Yes.
Bye, Susie.
So, how you feeling?
Oh, Lord, girl, if I was any number, I think I'd be dead.
Get a good night's sleep.
We got that 7:00 a.m. flight in the morning to New York.
Don't worry about me.
My alarm's set, sweetie, right here.
- Right here.
- Good.
- Was that your first time?
- First and last, sweetie.
Oh, Lord.
Oh, Lord.
No, I don't need this.
And he's white.
Okay, I can do this.
I can do this.
Morning, Officer.
Nice morning, isn't it?
Sun shining;
Birds a-chirpin;
Anybody tell you you look like Mel Gibson?
Do you have any idea how fast you were going, ma'am?
Well, see, actually, Officer, my speedometer is broken on this car.
And I was looking at it, but-- How fast was I going?
- I clocked you at 50.
- Is that a little too fast?
- I'm gonna have to see your license.
- Oh, Lord.
You really think we need to go that far?
I'm not even sure if it's in this car.
I might have left it in my other car.
It's a Benz.
Well, you better have it or I'm gonna have to impound this car...
- and you and I are going for a little ride.
- Where we going?
Here it is right here.
You know, Whitney Houston's my cousin.
JamalJeffries.
Who's JamalJeffries?
- That's me, Officer.
- That's you?
- Uh-huh.
- You expect me to believe that?
Well, it's true.
You see, the thing is--
I'm not armed.
I just recently had a little operation.
You mean, one of those operations where you--
- Uh-huh.
- So, you no longer have your--
- Uh-uh.
- And now you have a--
Yes.
- Get out of the car.
- Excuse me?
- What is the problem?
- Out of the car.
Come on.
- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Step away from the vehicle.
- Away from the vehicle.
- I'm not gonna have to spread any eagles?
Come on.
Spin around.
- All right.
How about this?
- All the way.
You look fabulous.
I'm having it done too.
I'm only about a thousand dollars away right now.
Who did you?
Well, whoever it was, they did a great job.
I got my post-op outfit all ready and waiting, hanging in my closet.
- It's got little ruffles on top.
- Excuse me.
Thank you very much.
Officer, trust me.
I believe you're gonna look great when you get it done.
- But I'm really in a hurry.
I really need to go.
-Just forget the ticket.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.
- No, not at all.
- You're gonna look great.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Turn to the side.
You're gonna look great.
- You think so?
Yes.
Make sure they get those nose hairs, especially on the left side.
You're gonna look great.
Thank you very much, Officer.
You have a good day.
Juwanna, they're double-teaming you every time.
If you don't start letting go of the ball, I'm gonna sit your ass down.
- All right.
Banshees on three.
One, two, three.
- Banshees!
Juwanna, remember what we was working on back home?
Not now.
I'm in a zone, okay?
Pass the ball.
Pass the ball.
Pass the ball!
- Pass the ball!
- Pass the ball!
- You ready to play?
You ready?
-Juwanna!
Move back!
Move back!
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.
Nice job,Juwanna!
Way to pass that down, baby.
You my dog!
You my dog!
Great shot.
Great shot.
Great shot, Magda.
Good shot.
All right, get in here.
Listen up, ladies.
We're gonna run green, penetrate left.
Squeeze.
A little breakdown, go right... and squeeze.
Let's win this thing.
On three.
One, two, three!
- Whoo!
Ladies, listen up.
I got a couple of things to say here.
First of all, uh... you guys played one hell of a game tonight.
I hope there's plenty more where that came from.
For those of you who are new to the Banshees, we have a little tradition.
- After every victory--
That's right-- we give away a game ball, and tonight it should come as no surprise... that the ball goes to...
Juwanna Mann.
Yeah!
Good game, Juwanna!
- Hey,Juwanna, kick it out.
I'm open.
Thank you, guys.
I really do appreciate it.
Oh, look at her getting all misty up in here.
I really do.
I mean it.
But I think that since Magda actually made the winning shot...
I think I should share this with her.
You share ball with me?
Oh, thank you,Juwanna.
Thank you.
- Oh, no, you don't have to--
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Precious time.
Let's shower up and get the hell out of here.
Good job, ladies.
Nice work there.
It's just superstition.
Never take it off after a win.
Never take it off.
You was really getting your game on tonight,Juwanna.
I have a feeling that we're gonna have a really good season this year.
Oh, yes, we are.
Whoa!
Look at you.
Isn't this cute?
I got it at Victoria's Secret.
Mm-hmm.
Whew.
Well, the secret's out.
It's just perfect for the road,you know?
You can just keep it comfy and simple.
Mm-hmm.
Comfy and simple.
Damn.
I am so sore tonight.
- Really?
- Would you mind rubbing a bit of this on my shoulders?
Oh!
Mm-hmm.
- I'll be more than happy to.
Yeah.
- Thank you, girl.
- Yes.
All right.
We can do that for each other.
- Thank you.
We was really balling tonight, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- Such teamwork.
Mm-hmm.
Ooh.
That feels good.
Yes, that was one... velvety smooth game.
I just get so stiff sometimes after the game.
Do you?
- I'm starting to.
- Hmm?
I'm starting to get stiff right here.
Right there.
- It's catching up with you?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks, girl.
I appreciate it.
- My pleasure.
- You want me to put a little bit on you?
- Where?
No.
I'm fine.
I'm just cool.
I'lljust sit here and hit the old hay.
Good night, Mr. Romeo.
You just so fine.
- Don't leave home without him, huh?
- You got that right.
He goes wherever I go.
You think Romeo takes your picture when he goes on the road?
Hell, I'm sure of it.
I glued it to the inside of his suitcase.
I'm just saying, uh, I know Romeo's a man... and I do know men, if you know what I mean.
All I'm saying is, girl, I trust my man.
Do you love him?
Look,Juwanna, I've never not had someone, and... even with the doubts, which I'm not gonna lie, there are some... it's better than being alone.
I'm not so sure about that, Michelle.
Oh, wow.
Look at these tomatoes.
They're looking good, Aunt Ruby.
Uh-huh.
Hey, baby, how did it go?
It went great, Aunt Ruby.
The game was off the hook.
I was off the hook.
They gave me the game ball.
And, Aunt Ruby...
I really think Michelle and I-- we're getting tight.
Oh!
You like her, do you?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I think I do.
- And she likes you?
- Well, she will.
I just got to keep working it.
She just starting to get into me.
- Get into you.
- Yep.
Have you lost your mind?
- What?
- You a man posing as a woman.
She don't want you.
She wants a girlfriend.
The second she find out you got a extra piece of equipment between your legs... what you think she gonna do?
Juwanna, I have been looking all over for you.
We've got a table right over there.
What's the matter?
You don't like my outfit, huh?
I told my girl this Pebbles do--
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?
- It's just-
- You look so beautiful tonight.
Thank you,Juwanna.
How sweet.
What do you mean, "Thank you"?
What ever happened to "Same to you"?
Oh.
I'm sorry, girl.
Same to you.
You looking good, girl.
- That's what I thought.
- Puff gonna love you in that dress.
- What? "Puff'?
I don't smoke.
- Puff.
You remember.
Over there.
Romeo's friend?
- You remember him.
Look.
- Oh, my Lord.
You did not just set me on a date with that Carolina river cricket.
- I thought I was doing you a favor.
- You call that a favor?
- He really likes you, girl.
- He can start liking somebody else.
- I'm up out of here.
-Juwanna, please don't leave.
I promised to Romeo that I'd hook you guys up... and it would really mean a lot to me if you would stay.
Please.
For me?
- Be nice.
I found her.
- I'm gonna try my best.
- How you doing,Juwanna?
- How are you, Mr. Romeo?
Well, well, well.
- If it isn't Juwanna Mann.
- How you doing, little Puffy?
All good.
I have to admit you are looking so hot tonight.
Sss!
Whew!
- Thank you.
- Let me "ax" you something.
- What do you wanna "ax" me?
- Did it hurt?
- Did what hurt?
- When you... fell from heaven.
Hallelujah!
It's called the bird.
Watch the wings.
Let's have a seat.
Let's have a good evening, huh?
I got the chair.
Sit on--
Good evening, folks.
Would you like to hear the specials?
Don't wanna hear any specials.Just get me a Cosmos, heavy on the vodka... and just keep pouring 'em and pouring 'em till your arms get tired.
- I'll have a glass of champagne, sir.
- Hold up.
Hold up.
My man, bring a bottle of your best champagne for the table.
Have we decided on dinner or do you need some more time?
- Don't need any more time.
- Ah, ah, ah.
Stymie that.
That's when you going country.
O-7-3-5-7!
The young lady wants a fil-let mig-non.
You know, little hunk of meat, little pink on the inside.
- I'll have the, uh--
- I'll have the snapper.
- Girl, you on fire tonight.
I like it though.
I like it like that.
- I'm gonna run off to the little ladies' room.
- I'd better go with you.
No, no, no.
- Well, the restroom's right back there.
- I can do this.
You know, that could be us out there, right?
- Hey, hey, hey!
Back your ass up.
Yo, Puff, let me holler at you for a second.
Yo, check it out.
Take the keys.
Take my car.
Look like I'm gonna be kickin' it here.
You kids be safe, if you know what I mean.
Funk.
Nice crib, young lady.
- You mind if I got something to drink?
- I ran out.
- How about if I use your bathroom?
- It's broken.
I'm mighty tired.
You mind if I crash on the couch?
Don't have one.
- You mind if I use the phone?
- Listen to me.
My line's dead.
Just cut the crap.
You're not getting into my house.
You don't need to come into my house.
You don't need to use the bathroom.
You can't sleep on my couch.
I don't need you to checking for any burglars.
And I don't have any aspirins for your fake headache.
I'll tell you what.
You're not getting inside of me or my house.
So you and little Puffy can just get to steppin'.
Get to steppin'.
- How about a little kiss?
- I ain't giving you no little-
- Eew!
Giving you no little kiss.
All right, then, good night.
But you know I could use a little sugar.
I--
That's what you can use.
That's exactly what you can use.
Well, I guess no means no.
You're just a big ol' man.
Now give me a big ol' hug.
Go right on over there.
Now, what is your name?
Jerry, you're gonna get one "To My Friend Jerry." There you are.
Juwanna Mann.
What's up?
Oh, my God.
Aren't you getting dizzy?
We ain't been here six hours and already you got some meat sending you flowers.
You move that fast on the court, you'd be league MVP about now.
Are you two done?
'Cause they're not even for me.
They're for Miss Juwanna.
{y:i}Ooh!
Give 'em here before you wilt 'em.
Let's just see who they from.
Can I read my own card, Lizard?
Let's see now.
"Roses are red, violets are not...
Love, Puff Smokey Smoke."
He's your mother's sister.
Oh,Juwanna.
Oh, please.
Trust me.
Puffy's not my type.
Anybody who sends me roses is definitely my type.
Hell, bitch, someone passes you the salt, he's your type.
Lizard, that's cold.
I'm gonna tell you ladies what my type is.
Somebody who sends you flowers for no reason at all.
You know?
Just because it's Wednesday or whatever.
And that's special.
Yeah.
- That's the kind of guy you hold on to.
- Well,you know what I like?
I like it when a man tells you... you're the most beautiful girl in the world.
-Aw, girl.
- Oh, Lord.
I hate to burst your bubble, Mother Teresa... but a man would tell you anything to tap that ass.
You got that right.
I'm gonna let you guys in on a little secret.
It's not that I'm easy or anything.
It's just you got to trust me on this.
The key to men is breaking through that little code they have... that little double-talk.
And what about when they take a baby girl out to dinner... talk about you can eat whatever you want, money's no object?
All that means is, if I'm spending this kind of money on your gut... when I get home, I want some of baby girl's-
- That's all that is.
And y'all all know the Mack Daddy line of them all.
Now, say it with me.
"I promise, baby...
I will call you tomorrow."
- Amen, girl!
- Hallelujah!
And what about when some men like to brag about the size of their manhood?
When we know it ain't the size of the boat, baby, but the motion of the ocean.
Can I get a "hallelujah"?
Can't get a "hallelujah"?
What you talking about,Juwanna?
The size of the boat don't matter.
- I want the "Titanic."
- You got that right!
All right, ladies, listen up.
No practice today.
Cool!
All right!
The team has a new insurance policy... so each one of you needs to take a new physical.
Come on, y'all.
Let's go knock this out real quick.
Juwanna Mann?
When was your last period?
My last period.
Okay, I had a game three days ago... and I played the whole game.
- So two periods.
- Oh, no, no.
You crack me up.
No, be serious.
Your menstrual period.
Oh.
Oh.
Um-
- Um--
Menstruation period.
Let's see here.
Last Thursday.
Yes, I think I unplugged last Thursday.
And any signs of gonorrhea, syphilis or chlamydia?
- Don't have any sisters.
Am I done yet, Doc?
- No, no, no.
I need for you to disrobe, and I'll step right outside... and I'll be back in just a few minutes.
Excuse me.
You want me to take off everything?
Every little stitch.
Miss Mann.
- Everything all right in there?
- I'll be right there, Doc.
Miss Mann.
I'm coming in, Miss Mann.
Bam!
I must be in the wrong locker room.
You can't go in there.
Mr. Daniels is a very busy man.
Who do you think you are?
Oh.
Betty, it's okay.
It's fine.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Betty.
Thank you, Betty.
Wow.
A third career.
Where the hell do you find the time?
I'm telling you right now.
I'm through.
I'm finished with this.
I'm out.
- I'm getting out.
- Okay, all right.
Have you checked with Juwanna on that?
I don't need to ask Juwanna.
I am Juwanna.
I just left a doctor who was about five minutes away... from a handful of Juwanna's nuts.
All right.
I just thought you might wanna run it by her... because, well, considering all the offiers I've been flooded with.
I don't think you're hearing me.
What do you mean, "offers"?

Yeah, it turns out that Juwanna... is every advertiser's dream come true.
She's easy to get along with... considerate of others, a real team player... pretty much everything you're not.
So, really, all you have to do is jump on board... with any one of these advertisers... you'll be making more money as Juwanna than you ever dreamed of as Jamal.
You're not getting it.
You're just not getting it.
I don't care about all that anymore.
Listen.
I did this for one reason, and I did it for one reason only.
I did it so JamalJeffries can get back into pro ball, man.
I wanna be back with my team, and that was it.
That's it.
Then I'll tell you that the network is pressuring the commissioner... and you're probably gonna get another hearing.
In the meantime, you might consider taking advantage of the Juwanna train... while the railroad is still in business.
You might wanna stop worrying about Juwanna so much... and worry about Lorne, 'cause this is about saving your career too.
Romeo.
My baby sleeping.
- Romeo?
- That's my name, baby.
That's my name.
- Romeo?
Hold on, baby.
I'm almost finished.
Romeo!
Who are you in my bed?
What are you doing in my house?
Baby, hold up.
It ain't me.
Groupies.
Hel--
Hello.
-Juwanna, it's Michelle.
- I need to talk to you.
- Girl, why are you crying?
I knew you wanted me.
I knew it was just a matter of time, baby.
What you want?
Six, five, four... three, two, one.
Happy New Year!
You see that, Michelle?
Being alone doesn't mean you have to be lonely.
Juwanna, how come I couldn't see what Romeo was doing behind my back?
It was probably the glare off Puff Smokey's teeth.
I know.
I know.
- It hurts like crazy now, sweetheart.
- Bad.
But you trust me.
You are so much better off.
I just hate being wrong.
Don't you go blaming yourself for this.
No, you don't.
You don't blame yourself for that low-down dirty snake.
Sweetheart, some men just don't realize what they've got till it's gone.
Now, you trust me.
One day he's gonna know.
Thanks.
Juwanna, you are such a good friend.
That's why I like you, 'cause you just keep it real.
You know?
No perpetrating with you.
You're just you.
- Actually, Michelle, there's something--
- And you know what else?
I'm gonna quit all of this crying and trippin'... and I'm just gonna move on.
- That's it.
Move right on.
- Yeah.
Let's have some more wine.
Michelle, I really need to tell you something.
I'm really hoping the playoffs can take my mind offi of things... 'cause you and the team are all that I plan on focusing on right now.
'Cause we got a really good chance of winning the championship this year.
Especially now, since we got you, dog.
Jamal.
Okay, it's all set.
Between the network, the players' union and my shameless groveling... we got you a meeting with the commissioner.
- That's great.
What do I have to do?
-Just show up, be polite, smile.
Let me do all the talking, pretty much like I'm doing now...
- and you're back in the league.
- Sounds good to me.
When is it?
- Tomorrow, 3:00.
- Wait a minute, Lorne.
You know I can't make that.
The Banshees start the playoffs tomorrow.
Well, you know what?
How about if my office tapes the game for you?
Yeah, but they're expecting Juwanna to play.
And I'm expecting Juwanna to disappear.
We got a deal here.
What am I busting my ass for?
Come on now.
Understand, will you?
There's a lot of people involved.
Yeah, Lorne, including Juwanna.
There are a lot of people counting on Juwanna too.
Jamal.
You're scaring me now with this.
I just need a minute, Lorne.
The fans are filing in with great anticipation... as the Charlotte Banshees prepare to host game one... of their WUBA playoff series against the Houston Gallop.
Yo, has anybody seen Juwanna?
Jeanne, this should really be an exciting playoff series.
You're right, Chris.
Even though these two teams are pretty evenly matched... most people expect the Banshees to win the series.
But in order to do that, they're gonna need a huge performance... by their star player, Juwanna Mann.
And we're gonna find out for real when they tip it off in just about 30 minutes.
- Hello.
- Hey, look.
It's me.
Can we, uh-- Can we reschedule the meeting?
No, we don't.
We're not rescheduling the meeting.
Let me make this real clear for you.
You're not here in five minutes, you're not gonna play in the league ever again.
This is it.
You understand me?
Oh, really?
Yeah, I understand.
That was him.
He's on his way.
Nothing to worry about, Mr. Commissioner.
What's it gonna be, boy?
You got to go somewhere.
And now introducing the starting lineup... for your Charlotte Banshees!
- I tried calling her.
- I don't believe this.
- Where she at?
- I don't know.
You know what it is I'm thinking?
Traffic.
Yeah, it's, uh--
It's always-- Down, you know, here it's bad.
Number 22...
Juwanna Mann!
Hey.
Where you been?
I had a friend that had some problems.
- Now let's kick some butt.
- All right.
Let's do this.
Come on.
Let's get in here.
Huddle up.
I guess some things never change.
No, you're wrong about that.
The moment we've been waiting for is finally here.
We are underway.
Ball.
Go, girls!
Yeah!
I've lost my mind!
- Way to go, Michelle.
- Good pass, baby.
Good pass.
- Right here, baby.
Right here.
- Move!
Move!
Move!
Things remain tight here.
The Gallop and the Banshees are playing equally so far.
They've been trading basket for basket,yet the Gallop holding a slim lead for the moment.
It's been that kind of game, but we should have a wild finish.
Juwanna Mann!
Juwanna Mann!
With just nine seconds left, the Banshees are down by one.
There's the steal.
The ball is stolen by Juwanna Mann.
Look at Juwanna Mann go.
Could Juwanna Mann possibly slam-dunk this ball?
Yes!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
Yes.
I can't believe what I'm seeing here.
It's Jamal Jeffries.
And that's your play of the day.
It don't make me no difference.
I still love you, Juwanna Mann.
I love you, Juwanna Mann!
Juwanna Mann!
I love you, even though I guess--
You're still a man.
I'm-
- Does that make me a man?
Juwanna!
Juwanna!
The hell is happening to me?
Hold on, Michelle.
I can explain, all right?
Just give me a minute.
Michelle.
Michelle!
Damn.
In perhaps the most bizarre sports story ever... women's pro basketball star, Juwanna Mann... has turned out to be exactly what her name implies-- a man.
He a sicko.
Straight-up sicko.
No comment.
Excuse me.
No comment.
Excuse me.
In my country, penis okay.
My mother have penis.
The WUBA's Charlotte Banshees have fired Jamal Jeffries for posing as a woman.
The WUBA's Charlotte Banshees have fired Jamal Jeffries for posing as a woman.
The odd thing is,Jeffries is known for being a big playboy.
The team said they became suspicious when they caught him hitting on himself.
In fact-- In fact, he could--
Since the opening tip, the Charlotte Banshees really have been struggling.
They have not looked very smooth offiensively here.
Jamal,Jamal,Jamal.
I see you moping around.
I see you down in the dumps.
I also see you ain't been using no plates in this room.
You got yourself quite a mess here.
I'll clean it up.
I'm not talking about this mess.
I'm talking about that mess.
Sit up.
Scoot over.
It's no sense in crying over spilt milk
Best thing to do is start looking for a paper towel.
You hear me?
Huh?
- Next.
- Damn.
It appears the Banshee fans are just as disheartened as the players.
Well, Chris, I would absolutely have to agree with you.
And unlike the Gallop, this Phoenix Web team, they have a lot of game.
The Banshees need to turn this around now.
Otherwise, they are gonna get blown out and they will not advance to the finals.
Brought my A-game today.
Let's pick it up, guys.
Can you handle that?
Second half.
That's what I wanna see.
What's the matter with you guys?
Huh?
Coach, face it.
We're never gonna get to the championship without Jamal.
That's not true.
What you doing here?
This is the ladies' locker room, pe"rv".
I just wanna talk to you guys, all right?
- Oh, please.
- You ain't got nothing to say.
All right, ladies, hold up.
I think we're letting Mr.Jeffries offi a little easy by throwing him out.
Let's listen to what he has to say.
I think we all wanna hear this.
Guys, look, uh...
I messed up, all right?
What I did it was-- it was wrong, it was selfish... and I'm--
I'm truly sorry.
When I first got here, I got to tell you...
I thought women's basketball was a big joke.
Hell, I thought anything that wasn't about Jamal Jeffries was a big joke.
Turns out the joke was on me.
That's because I thought that the most important thing about basketball... was being a star.
That's until you guys taught me the only way to truly shine... was to be a part of a team.
So if you guys wanna hate me... and Lord knows I understand you if you do.
But you're gonna have to hate me after the game... because you guys never needed me to win this... and you don't need me now.
I needed you.
So come on.
Go win it.
And, Latisha.
Your game is on.
Keep an eye out for Magda.
She's getting open in the post.
I don't know what happened in that locker room at halftime... but the Banshee team is playing with tremendous emotion.
-Somehowthey've been rejuvenated.
- Well, Chris,you're right.
This is like a completely different team.
What an amazing turnaround.
Don't look now, but the Banshees might actually get to the big show.
We're winners!
Dear Michelle--
Just 'cause it's Wednesday.
The fans dese"rv"e to have a true basketball star... and a future role model finish his career on top.
Please believe me when I tell you that Mr.Jeffries is a changed man.
And I say that, not only as his agent... but as his friend too.
Mr.Jeffries, after hearing the very sincere... and impassioned plea from your representative...
I must say that I am still left rather unimpressed.
You have not only disgraced our men's pro league... but the women's pro league as well.
This is a closed hearing.
With all due respect, sir, and on behalf of the Charlotte Banshees... we in no way feel that JamalJeffries has disgraced our league.
and he is certainly paying the price for that.
- But we forgive him.
- No doubt, no doubt.
We feel that you should too.
We want you to have this,Jamal.
I'm convinced.
I think they've made their point.
We out of here, y'all.
And now, returning for his second year at starting guard... the only man who has played in both the men's... and women's professional basketball leagues...
North Carolina's own...
Jamal Jeffries!
- Hey, you, you!
- What, man?
That's not a keg.
You know how much this stupid thing costs?
What does it matter to you?
The bank owns it now an"yw"ay.
The bank?
The bank owns this?
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?
The bank's got a dustpan in the kitchen.
Maybe you need to get that too.
What's up, baby?
Yeah.
You look like an angel in this light.
- Give it to me.
- Mark.
Yo, man, what's up?
I just saw you on the television, man.
That movie was the flyest.
You did like this.
You do it like this.
Oh, yeah.
You went like this.
I was like--
- Oh, you don't have to--
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, Magda.
You done woke up Lil' Puff.
I'm gonna wrap it around it.
Watch this.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Riding it.
Ride it, cowboy!
Rawhide!
I like it rough.
- Aunt Ruby-
- Aunt Ruby, please.
- Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm.
- You got to get on the floor, boy.
- Oh, shit.
So sorry.
- Get your ass on that floor.
- So sorry.
Do that walk I taught you.
Aw, shit.
- Lorne, just feel them for me.
- Why?
- I just want you to feel them.
- Oh, man, those are good.
That looks good on you, baby.
- Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
- No.
Oh, my God.
Lorne, not you too.
That can really only happen when a tyrannical system is so well-established that it can dominate the entire fabric of society.
And the Germans are good at organizing.
People's consciences too?
Yes.
You see, that's an area where Hitler did a huge amount of harm.
He actually tried to manipulate the consciences of the German people.
He convinced them they had a task to do, they had to exterminate the Jews, because the Jews caused all our problems.
It wasn't Hitler's own idea it had been put forward much earlier.
That they had to make a sacrifice.
And I can remember a writer she interviewed a soldier who had been stationed in a concentration camp.
He was a guard, and she asked him:
"Didn't you feel any pity at all for the people you treated so badly there?"
And he replied, "Yes, I certainly did feel pity for them but I had to overcome it.
That was a sacrifice I had to make for the greater cause."
And that's what happened to conscience.
After all, Hitler always used to say:
"You don't have to worry, any of you you just have to do whatever I say, and I'll take responsibility."
As if anyone can take charge of another person's conscience.
I do think you can make someone's conscience more sensitive or desensitize it, or manipulate it.
Traudl Junge, née Humps, was born in 1920 and was Hitler's secretary from 1942 until the end of the war.
She also took dictation for his last will and testament.
For more than 50 years she kept her memories to herself and remained silent about her life, her adversities and her distress.
Frau Junge married Hitler's manservant Hans Hermann Junge, in 1943.
Shortly thereafter he enlisted for frontline service and was shot and killed 14 months later in France during a low attack.
Starting in the mid-1950s, she lived in a one-bedroom flat in Munich.
In April and June 2001 several meetings with Frau Junge were arranged by author Melissa Müller which resulted in this film.
The longer I live, the older I get the more I feel this burden this feeling of guilt, because I worked for a man and I actually liked him, but he caused such terrible suffering.
You see, details came out later about what really happened in the concentration camps.
I read Viktor Klemperer's books, and it was much later, of course but it did give me the very strong sensation that all these problems at least began for the Jews right at the start, in 1933 or 1934.
And the feeling that I was so unaware and so thoughtless....
l didn't notice or pay attention.
That feeling has oppressed me more and more.
It seems to me that I should be angry with the child I was, that juvenile young girl or that I can't forgive her for failing to recognize in time what horrors that monster caused.
The fact that I didn't see what I was getting involved in and above all that I just said "yes" without thinking at all.
After all, it wasn't as though I were a fervent Nazi.
And when I went to Berlin, I could have said:
"No, I don't want that job I don't want to be sent to the Führer's headquarters."
But I didn't do that, because I was simply too curious.
And I suppose I couldn't really imagine that destiny would drive me on and leave me in a situation that I had never aspired to at all.
But nevertheless I find it hard to forgive myself for everything.
I mean, of course today there's no doubt about it. I have to say:
He was an absolute criminal.
He was a criminal-- lt's just that I didn't realize it.
At some point afterwards I began to wonder if I should have seen that.
But then I think I was only 1 3 years old when he first came on the scene and I was quite late developing in lots of ways and after all, apart from me there were millions who didn't see that.
I mean, it's not as though everyone apart from me realized what a criminal he was.
And I try to take heart from those thoughts.
And Hitler did somehow embody something monumental at first, when I was a child.
The first time I met him he probably had a kind of paternal protective attitude towards me too and that's something I had longed for.
I'd never been able to follow my own inclinations and I'd never had that feeling of security in a complete family.
My mother did everything for us, it's true but I used to envy children who could say things like:
"My father says so and so," or "My father thinks...."
I used to think having a father must be very important.
Then I started working for Hitler, and suddenly I had that sense of security too.
There really was a certain kind of security in that...
I think I matured late, as well.
I think I had a very subservient attitude toward him as a father figure.
But that can easily be transformed into hatred, if your father disappoints you.
Unfortunately, my family was completely apolitical.
My mother brought us up by herself, and her father who was a general was really a tyrant in the house.
Devil at home and angel in company, people always used to say.
He wasn't at all interested in politics and the subject was never discussed.
We were brought up according to various other principles:
Doing without things, making sacrifices and backing down.
They were all seen as virtues, although today the attitude is virtually the opposite.
And I think I was incredibly conformist as a child.
I always had to do without things and make sacrifices because my mother had such a difficult time.
She ran the household for her father and since she didn't have any money, as a divorced woman he always made it clear to us that he was supporting us.
And there was always that pressure that mental and moral pressure surrounding the whole situation.
I actually ended up with Hitler by complete coincidence by chance and foolishness, I'd have to say.
When I was a young girl I didn't really have any exact ideas or plans that I wanted to achieve in my life, or any sense of wanting to be something.
And I couldn't go to high school because the school fees were a problem for my mother.
So I had to leave secondary school after the first state examination.
And then they said, "You'd better go to commercial school "and get a job in an office, that's" "the quickest way to earn a living. "
"And so that was to be my fate" "and I couldn't see" "any other chance at all".
"I suppose I also felt awkward "because I was the oldest" and I was still at home while my younger sister was out in the big wide world.
Then she came up with an idea.
She said:
"l know, let's ask Albert Bormann if he can get you transferred to Berlin."
And I said all right, without any idea at all, of course what the consequences would be.
I ought to explain something else.
At that time, you see, which was 1941 I'd always thought that as well as working in an office I could satisfy my passion for dancing and I really wanted to go to dance school.
So in 1941 I took the entrance exam for dance school and the result was very good, so I thought I could escape from office work forever.
But they wouldn't let me leave the publishing company where l was working, because during the war you could only change your job with the permission of your employer.
And that made me so disappointed and so cross that I poured my heart out to my sister who was a dancer in Berlin by that time.
And then she got her best friend to talk to her brother-in-law, Albert Bormann, and ask him to have me transferred.
So that was a chance for me to get away from home and also get back at them in a way.
It was an act of defiance too against my employer, who didn't want to let me go.
I should also say that when I was in Berlin working in the Führer's chancellery I never saw Hitler face to face at all.
I used to open his mail and read the love letters women would send him but he wasn't there in person at all.
None of the others ever saw him either.
He was in his personal headquarters far away from his outer office, you might say.
Then one day a typing competition was announced, throughout the whole of the chancellery complex and it was rumored that Hitler was looking for a young girl to be his secretary.
Albert Bormann absolutely insisted that I should take the test.
So I did, but I genuinely didn't have any real ambition to get the job because I was actually quite content with my life at that time.
Living with my sister was fine and the job was quite interesting....
Anyway, I took the typing test and apparently I was quite good even though I had the feeling that I was awful.
In any case, one day, I think it was in October or November, or later....
No, it was much later, it was early in December and the 10 best girls from the typing test were told to board the Führer's special train and taken to the Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia.
At first we stayed on the Führer's train which was in the grounds of the headquarters until Hitler had time to see us which took days, in the end.
And then, one night we were taken through a dark forest to the Führer's bunker.
And that's where the decisive meeting actually took place.
It was a very unpleasant building, that bunker was and in the anteroom, the servant's area we all lined up.
There were some chairs with cork seats and we waited until Hitler came.
Now, I'd only ever seen him in newsreels and public appearances.
So I knew his military expression with his arm outstretched.
And then a kindly old gentleman came up to us speaking in a low voice and giving us a friendly smile.
He shook hands with each of us looked straight into our eyes with that famous gaze of his asked our names said a few words to us with a sort of friendly, paternal air and then disappeared again.
When he went he just said, "Good evening."
The experience of meeting him was completely different than I had imagined beforehand.
It wasn't at all frightening, and there was a harmless, peaceful atmosphere.
When it was over we said, "Now we're curious to know who he's chosen." And then Bormann said:
"Not so fast, now you'll have a trial dictation."
So I went for a trial dictation.
But Bormann sent another girl along with me, just in case because apparently Hitler had already had a nasty experience one time when he asked a secretary to write down something he wanted to dictate.
She was so nervous that she had a sort of hysterical fit and he was afraid of that happening again.
Well, I entered the room and I could feel how cold it was.
Hitler didn't like warm rooms.
And he was very friendly towards me, again.
"My child," he said, "Don't be nervous.
You can't possibly make as many mistakes as me.
Sit over here.
Shall I fetch a heater for you?"
He meant an electric heater.
We had special typewriters that were quiet.
They were called Silenta typewriters.
And then he started dictating something.
Well, I started typing, but I knew my hands were trembling so much that I didn't hit any of the right keys.
I stared down at the paper, and it looked like Chinese.
And then, thank God, or perhaps unfortunately his servant came in, Linge, and said to Hitler:
"My Führer, Ribbentrop is on the phone."
So Hitler picked up the phone and talked for a while like any other boss would do.
And that gave me time to calm down and rewrite the sentence in correct German.
Then he dictated some more, and it was fine.
It was actually quite easy.
At the end I gave him the paper, and I went.
He was quite happy, and I was quite happy.
I did find it exciting.
I didn't know what had happened to me.
Suddenly there I was, little Traudl Humps, sitting opposite the Führer.
And the Führer himself, whatever you thought about him was a great man in those days.
It was such an extraordinary situation "so incredible, such an adventure".
"And then he called for me "a few more times, to take dictation" "even though there were other" "secretaries available" the two old secretaries.
I really liked being in the Führer's headquarters, in the forest.
In fact, all my life I've disliked working those rigid office hours and sitting at a desk all day long.
And there was none of that there.
After all, Hitler didn't want someone in the outer office a secretary sitting there all day long, managing appointments and taking phone calls and making coffee for him.
The secretaries weren't stationed in an office at all.
They had their own apartments, their own rooms and were only called to take dictation.
He only dictated public speeches or private letters or some other personal things.
We never had to write anything about politics or military matters.
Then he called for me again and the two old secretaries were standing to his left and right and he said, "Fräulein Humps now I should like to ask you if you wish to remain with me."
And then he said:
"You know, it's always a problem for me if I take pretty young secretaries.
Someone always marries them and whisks them off.
Maybe they should have to wear disfiguring ornaments like Negro women, in their lips."
And I must have been mad, because I said to him:
"My Führer, you don't have to worry in this case.
I've been without a man for the last 22 years so it's no problem for me."
And he just burst out laughing.
At the time I didn't realize what nonsense I was talking.
"l've been without a man for the last 22 years!"
Now, I have to confess I couldn't really say "no" at that point.
I didn't have any reason to say, "No, I don't want to stay with you."
To be honest, I must admit I liked the idea.
In February '43, after Stalingrad things were really quite different though I didn't notice it very much because I was so new.
But the atmosphere in the Führer's headquarters must have changed at that time.
There was an oppressive atmosphere.
Up until that time Hitler used to take his meals with his officers in the mess which of course meant that everyone would talk shop.
It wasn't very relaxing for him.
Then it occurred to him that he could take his meals with his secretaries and we were told not to bother him with questions about Stalingrad or other subjects.
He wanted to take it easy at mealtimes.
So it was arranged that of the four secretaries two would have lunch with him each day.
The other two would have dinner with him and the two from lunch would have a cup of tea with him at night.
You know, I never had the feeling that he was conscious of pursuing criminal aims.
For him they were ideals.
For him they were great goals.
And human life meant nothing to him in comparison.
But that only became so apparent to me afterwards.
You see, in the inner circle surrounding him in his private sphere I was shielded from the megalomaniac projects and the barbaric measures.
That was the awful thing, that's what gave me such a shock later, when I realized what had been happening.
When I started working there I thought I was at the source of information and in fact, I was in a blind spot.
It's like in an explosion, there's one place where calmness reigns.
And that was the great illusion the great, not disappointment, but the great lie that I had made myself believe.
That same man who made speeches, when I think back with that rolling R and all that roaring and clipping his words I never heard him speak like that in private.
He could speak in such a flattering-- Such a modulated tone.
In his private life he had that gentle Austrian intonation too and he used some words that were typically Austrian.
For example, "nimmermehr", or "nevermore" isn't used in Bavaria or the rest of Germany.
"l heard it nevermore." And things like that did fascinate me, really.
The courteous manner he displayed in his private life.
Apart from his stomach and digestive disorders, he gave the impression of being very healthy.
And he had to cope with an unhealthy way of life.
Far too little fresh air, far too little exercise.
He didn't smoke or drink alcohol although being healthy is more than that.
But his problems were all connected with the stomach and digestion.
And maybe that's the underlying reason why he had a vegetarian lifestyle, or such an unbalanced lifestyle.
He was very dependent on Dr. Morell, his personal physician.
And the doctor was a very exotic character.
He had been a ship's doctor, and he'd lived in India for years.
His approach to medicine was what I would today describe as "holistic."
With some homeopathic elements and natural remedies.
Dr. Morell had to help him a lot constantly giving him some sort of pills for his digestion or for gas, and he also gave him hormone and vitamin injections.
He used to swear by them.
I often used to ask Hitler's servant about his personal habits and he would tell me some things himself.
For example, he never liked being touched.
He didn't think much of massage or other things to do with the body.
And one time he said to me:
"l can't wear shorts because my knees are so white.
I'm not the athletic sort."
Or he once said:
"Eva always wants me to keep my back straight but I always say she should try it with such heavy keys in her pockets."
He used to talk a lot about private matters and also about quite personal things.
For instance, once the war had started he never wore anything but army gray.
Before the war he wore tails for formal occasions or his brown SA uniform.
It was a matter of principle for him.
He was a clean, well-groomed man.
For instance, he always washed his hands when he had been stroking his dog.
His dog Blondie meant an awful lot to him.
Blondie could provide a whole evening's entertainment.
He was convinced that she was incredibly clever and sophisticated an absolutely wonderful dog all around.
And she had a real fixation with him too.
Even though she had been trained by a dog trainer and was very well looked after.
I don't think Hitler fed the dog himself.
But I remember now that in Hitler's small bedroom in the bunker there was a big wooden box for Blondie, as well.
It was very large, in case she had puppies.
It was crowded in there with us all gathered around the bed.
If you wanted to leave, everyone had to stand up.
Well, anyway Blondie could do all sorts of tricks too.
She could bark when given a command and not just bark, she could sing!
She could make a sort of howling noise, and if Hitler said:
"Sing deeper, Blondie, sing like Zarah Leander" Blondie would sing an octave deeper.
He was very proud of that trick.
He was also immensely proud that she always obeyed him.
She really did obey his every word.
Sometimes he'd go for a walk with her in the grounds where lots of obstacles had been built and he was really pleased to see how clever she was.
Sometimes he'd throw a dumbbell for her but then she'd just pick it up at one end and it would hang down sideways.
Then he used to show us what she would do.
He'd put his head on one side and imitate Blondie gazing up at him, to check he was looking.
And he'd have to say, "Blondie, properly!"
And then she'd put it down properly.
He used to tell lots of stories like that and I think he really enjoyed it.
When I think about it now, and listen to what I'm saying all of these little stories sound so banal.
I think those characteristics of his the personal mannerisms he had aren't really at all important now because the total effect was so terrible.
I mean, at the time it was quite important for me, of course to see his human side.
But today it's almost as though I'd rather not describe these things so clearly.
Was there a moment a certain time, when you had the feeling that the issue of the Jews came up?
I'll tell you about one incident which took place at the Berghof when Himmler was also present, I think it was the only time.
Then he talked about concentration camps.
He said that there was what was called a "method" and it was managed quite cleverly.
So for example if someone was an arsonist, he was put on fire duty and you could be quite sure there would never be a fire.
That comment was the only time that the term concentration camp was ever mentioned there.
The word Jew was virtually never used in everyday speech.
The fact that Hitler would, at times say something in his speeches about "international Judaism" or "the Jews," that was virtually ignored.
Nobody ever raised the subject at least, not in our presence.
Actually, the only time I can remember the subject really being an issue was one evening at the Berghof when Frau von Schirach was a guest.
I wasn't there at the time, I only heard about it.
I was out of the room when it happened.
She was on fairly cordial terms with Hitler and she suddenly raised the subject.
She told the Führer directly that it was quite terrible, the way the Jews were treated in Amsterdam.
They were packed into trains she said, and it was an inhumane way to behave.
It must have made him very angry and he said to her:
"Don't interfere in things you don't understand.
This mawkishness and sentimentality."
He really was very annoyed.
He walked right out of the room and didn't return.
And Frau Schirach was never invited to the Berghof again.
I think my husband told me about it.
He was there at the time.
It's something I often thought about since then....
You couldn't discuss anything with him that was somehow sensitive or difficult.
It was one aspect of him.
And that was really the only time a conflict situation developed.
But I sometimes think if I ever had the opportunity to meet Hitler again, in this life or in some other world I really would like to ask him what he would have done if he had found some Jewish blood in his own family.
Would he have gassed himself?
He didn't think in human dimensions.
Humanity was never of any importance to him.
It was always the concept of the superman the nation, always this abstract image of a vast German Reich, powerful and strong.
But the individual never mattered to him.
Though he always said he wanted to make people happy.
He started a variety of welfare and recreational organizations in the Third Reich.
Personal happiness was never of the slightest importance to him.
Love was quite alien to him?
He never really spoke about love.
In fact, I never heard him say the word.
That has just occurred to me.
His ideas on the subject were really what you'd almost call primitive.
The greatest hero deserves the most beautiful woman.
He once said that Robert Ley, the politician, had a beautiful wife and she must have been beautiful.
But in the same way that Brigitte Helm was as if she were made of marble, that amazingly regular, blond beauty.
Although I think she was incredibly boring.
He couldn't understand how a man with such a beautiful wife could be unfaithful with a less beautiful woman.
He couldn't imagine that a woman could have any other qualities apart from flawless beauty.
I don't think he really knew very much about women.
And I never had the feeling that his relationship with Eva had a very strong erotic element.
He certainly exerted considerable attraction, but I don't know whether I'm right about this, but I had the impression that he felt uneasy about anything erotic.
I can't really explain it.
I think he wasn't prepared to let himself go.
And that's a very important part of an erotic relationship, after all.
He really liked arranging marriages but if he was ever asked why he didn't marry, he'd say:
"l wouldn't be a good husband.
I couldn't allow myself to be."
And he probably wanted to maintain the image of an unmarried man for the sake of the female voters.
I mean, women were crazy about him.
I really don't know why.
He did once say something else on the subject.
He said, "Children are always a risk.
Sometimes the children of a genius turn out to be cretins."
And even though I was such a naive young girl it struck me as very odd.
How can anyone regard himself as a genius?
It made me flinch inside.
The 20 of July, 1944 was a particularly hot, oppressive day.
Frau Christian and I took advantage of the weather that morning to go for a bicycle ride outside the restricted area, to a little lake where we could swim around and lie in the sun for a while.
We didn't say a word to each other, we were just dreaming.
When the sun was high in the sky, and we knew it must be noon we decided it was time to start back.
We didn't know if the situation report meeting had started and we might have been needed earlier in any case.
When we got back to the camp the officers' cars were parked there, so the meeting was still in progress.
We went to our room and all of a sudden there was a terrible bang.
There were often loud noises if a deer stepped on one of the land mines or there was an air-raid exercise, or a new weapon was being tested.
We didn't think anything of it.
But then suddenly there was a huge uproar outside.
Someone called the doctor.
We raced out of the barracks, and somehow we could tell that something had happened.
Then we ran towards the Führer's bunker and there were soldiers running towards us, saying:
"You can't go any further, there's been a bomb explosion."
But we didn't know whether the Führer had been hit or any details about what had happened.
Then we headed for the building where the meeting had taken place and we wanted to go inside but just then someone came towards us covered in blood, General Jodl, I think and Major Weizenegger, one of the staff officers and they said to us:
"There's no access here, you can't go on.
You'll have to turn back."
It really was a big shock for us because it made us wonder what would happen to us if the Führer really had been killed how things could carry on.
There were all sorts of wild thoughts in our heads:
"What will happen to us?"
Or, "Who could continue to lead us in the war after the Führer?"
It really was an atmosphere of extreme panic.
We went back to our room and waited there.
Then Otto Günsche came to see us.
He looked very disheveled and anxious but he said, "No need to worry, nothing happened to the Führer.
He's in his bunker now and you can go and see him, if you like."
So we made our way to the Führer's bunker and he was standing in the anteroom.
He looked so funny, we almost burst out laughing.
His hair was standing on end his trousers were hanging in tatters but he greeted us with an almost triumphant smile, and said:
"l have been saved.
Destiny has chosen me, providence has preserved me.
It is a sign that I must see my mission through to the end.
Those cowards were too scared to open fire and risk their own lives they planted a bomb."
He was raging and cursing and he thought the construction squad that had just built the barracks might have hidden a bomb in the floor of the building.
Then we left him.
He told us with great pride that Dr. Morell had taken his pulse, and it was quite normal.
He just had some bruises on his right arm, which hurt him so he kept it inside the jacket of his uniform.
At the time we were very relieved because after all, we had been spared a huge change that would have affected us in ways we could hardly imagine.
We had dinner with him that evening.
No, that afternoon Mussolini came for a visit.
Hitler was very proud when he showed him the site of the explosion.
He explained that the building had been completely destroyed.
It was a fairly flimsy structure.
And of course he stressed again that it was an act of fate, an act of divine providence that the meeting had not been held in the bunker as originally planned.
Since the bunker wasn't finished, it had been moved to the barracks.
If it had been in the bunker, he said:
"l would no longer be alive."
But very soon afterwards something came to light that shocked him to the very core.
He was in talks to establish how the attack had been mounted when suddenly the telephone operator came up to him and said:
"My Führer, Colonel Stauffenberg has left the barracks.
He said he was going to make a phone call, but he didn't."
Apparently he used that as a pretense to leave the barracks but the telephone operator said, "He didn't make any phone calls."
So straight away suspicion fell on certain officers instead of the construction squad and of course the information was sent to Berlin immediately.
Goebbels was informed, and in Berlin the whole apparatus was set in motion.
The Army Supreme Command stepped in, or was informed and Goebbels contacted Colonel Remer who was in command of the greater Deutschland regiment.
They occupied the radio station, and other important sites too, I think so everything went very, very wrong for Stauffenberg.
Meanwhile in the Führer's headquarters this betrayal by senior staff officers naturally caused a huge panic.
Hitler flew into a rage.
He started cursing the cowards who wanted to get rid of him and had absolutely no idea what would happen in Germany and throughout Europe if he were no longer alive if Judaism were once more in power, full of hatred that would destroy Germany, the whole of Europe and the entire culture.
"They have no idea," he said "what our enemies plan to do with Germany and Europe."
The Western powers would never be powerful enough to resist Bolshevism, he claimed.
Only he had the capacity to do that and he would not be prevented from carrying out his mission.
There was no other solution, Germany had to win the war.
By this time he had worked himself up into an almost euphoric mood.
And the incident made him feel even more certain he was on the right path.
I have often wondered whether it might have been possible before then, when the situation wasn't so absolutely terrible, for him to say:
"l can't win the war."
Perhaps he would have said at some point:
"l have to make peace." But after the attack any hope of that was completely in vain.
He felt so reinforced in his beliefs and that evening he made a speech to the German nation saying he had been saved in a miraculous way and telling us we had to stake everything on winning the war.
"We must triumph!" That stupid, "We must triumph because triumph we must!"
Hitler always used to say, "lt is impossible for Bolshevism to be victorious.
I am the only one who can prevent that.
Without Germany, the Western powers are not strong enough to halt this avalanche."
He was convinced of that but he must also have seen that victory was impossible.
I actually think he had lost touch with reality.
He simply no longer had his feet firmly on the ground.
So then he wanted to make a clean sweep and drag everyone else down with him.
As for myself, deep in my heart I did have some doubts, and I wondered:
"ls all this absolutely right?"
But then to question the situation actually to initiate a discussion would have taken more courage.
And I think it's also the case that if you value and respect someone you don't really want to destroy the image of that person you don't want to know, in fact if disaster lies behind the façade.
I don't think he considered war a light-hearted matter.
He regarded it as a terrible thing although he never said so.
For instance, whenever there were reports of air raids and people described the situation, or if I said something like:
"My Führer, you can't imagine how miserable it is for all those homeless people whose houses have been bombed it's just so terrible."
He'd stop me right away and say:
"l know exactly how it is, but we shall strike back.
We shall take revenge, and with our new weapons everything will change.
Vengeance will be ours!"
He would always say that, and in particular he'd say that we would rebuild everything after the war and make it better than ever.
I think there was a general policy of denial.
He never did see a city that had been badly bombed.
We traveled through Germany in the special train with the blinds down and when he reached Anhalter Station in Berlin at night the chauffeur would take the streets that weren't so badly damaged.
Another thing, he would never have flowers in his room.
He hated to have dead things around.
And that's strange, when you think about it.
Someone who kills thousands of people doesn't want dead flowers in his room, beautiful flowers.
With a sort of last thirst for life, "Eva Braun tried" "to organize one final party".
She took the people "who were still there" "back up to her old living quarters" "and played one single record called,""Red Roses Tell You of Love. "
There was dancing and champagne and she was almost hysterically cheerful.
But there was a forced, desperate atmosphere and it was eerie.
The Russian rocket launchers provided an accompaniment.
I was there for a while, but then I left.
I was in a very miserable mood.
Then I went down to the bunker, where l had sleeping quarters and I tried to get some sleep.
The following day, which was the 22 of April Hitler called a meeting to discuss the situation.
All the officers from the general staff came along General Krebs, General Burgdorf and all the adjutants.
All of a sudden he opened the door of the conference room walked out into the anteroom, to his study and sent for us.
I mean the women who were still there:
Frau Christian and me and the cook, Fräulein Manzialy and Eva Braun.
And he said:
"All is lost.
You must leave Berlin at once."
His face was like a mask of stone.
In fact, it already looked as though he were wearing a death mask.
We stood there, completely stunned and then Eva Braun walked up to him took both his hands in hers and said:
"But you must know I'll stay with you.
I shall never leave you."
And then he leaned forwards and for the first time that anyone had ever seen he kissed her on the lips.
Then Frau Christian and I both said:
"l'm staying here."
I don't know why I said it.
I suppose I couldn't imagine where else to go.
And I felt quite anxious, in a way.
I was scared of leaving that secure environment.
Maybe I didn't really believe it was so serious, as well.
Then he said, "l shall shoot myself."
And he added:
"l only wish my generals had as much courage as you."
Then we left the room and everyone from the meeting was standing there.
Their faces were either red or as white as corpses.
And they stood completely still.
I don't remember what I did after that.
The whole situation had somehow left me in a state of shock.
But life went on, at least for a while.
Hitler insisted there was no way of saving the situation although the generals kept on trying to persuade him there were some possibilities.
But after the 22 of April there was one disaster after another.
Then all personnel who could be spared left and headed south.
Hitler's chief adjutant, a man called Schau was an old warrior from the early days, a loyal follower and he had to pack all the private documents and papers in a box.
He burnt some of them in front of the bunker and he put the others in the last plane to leave.
Then he had to get away himself.
He had to set off for Munich, so he could do the same thing there.
Sort through all the files and documents and destroy some of them.
He parted from the Führer with tears in his eyes.
Fräulein Wolf and Fräulein Schröder also had to leave Berlin and those of us who were left started to lead a sort of shadowy existence.
We lost track of whether it was day or night.
We would have meals without knowing what we were eating.
We still tried to conduct conversations but from that point on, most of the talk was really about the best, most certain and most painless way to put an end to our lives.
Naturally we said to Hitler, "Why don't you try to get away?"
His reply was, "l do not wish to fall into enemy hands alive."
So we said, "Why do you insist on killing yourself?"
He said, "l do not want the enemy to take me alive.
I have no strength to fight at the head of my troops and none of my loyal followers will shoot me when I ask them to.
So I shall have to do it myself."
At that point he obtained some poison capsules from Himmler.
We asked for some too.
The stories about what the Russian troops did to the women when they occupied German towns were so terrible and frightening that we also asked if we could have cyanide capsules for use in an emergency.
He gave us some tablets, and as he did so, he said:
"l would have preferred to give you a nicer farewell gift."
We were also allowed to learn to shoot.
Although for some time we had been shooting at targets in the grounds of the chancellery.
We had requested this before, back in East Prussia but he had refused.
Now he granted our request.
Eva Braun joined in.
A couple of days later, it must have been about the 24 of April Goebbels happened to see me in the corridor, and he said:
"Frau Junge, my family will now be moving into the Führer's bunker.
See to it that the children are given somewhere to sleep."
I passed the message on to the household steward or the director of the Führer's living quarters and a room was provided for the children.
There were bunk beds for the children, all set up.
Not long afterwards Frau Goebbels came along with the six children.
The children were in a good mood and happy that they could be with Uncle Hitler.
I suppose someone said, "We'll be safer in here."
I don't think they had begun to suspect that it was going to be a very, very bad time all around.
Naturally all through this period there was a terribly tense atmosphere everywhere.
What was going to happen in this last round of attack and defense?
Reports would come from the front but without providing any real news.
There were always crisis meetings that broke up without any hope.
There were no more attacks and there was no more defense.
Because Hitler had given up all hope and he had withdrawn, withdrawn into himself.
He became completely numb and apathetic and he would just sit in the corridor with one of the puppies.
Blondie had had puppies by then.
They lived in a small room in the bunker a washroom.
He would sit there with a puppy in his lap, staring ahead blankly.
We didn't know what he was waiting for but the officers kept on trying....
Suddenly they came along with a suggestion that General Wenck who was heading west with his army at the time could turn back and meet up with General Steiner coming down from the north.
Then it should be possible to save Berlin.
That gave Hitler a new lease of life.
He started to show an interest in the situation again there were more meetings, and we would sit around.
By now we didn't know if it was day or night.
There were no more regular mealtimes.
Nothing was done with any ceremony anymore.
People even started smoking in Hitler's presence.
There were still conversations around the dinner table.
And still tea in the evening.
Though Hitler was very apathetic then and the mood was very subdued which was naturally to be expected.
And there were also a few attempts at a kind of gallows humor like, "Chin up while you've still got one!"
It was an awful time.
We all acted somehow as if we were automatons, without....
l simply can't remember any genuine feelings at all.
It was like drifting and not really being yourself at all.
You have to imagine what the situation was like.
The deafening roar of artillery and air raids the completely ghostly atmosphere against a background of constant noise.
But despite everything sometimes when there was a break in the shelling and it was quiet up top, I'd go outside with Eva Braun and Frau Christian, into the grounds.
And it was spring up there!
The narcissuses were in bloom, there were buds on the trees the sun was shining, and somehow that raised our hopes again made us feel alive again because nature had not come to a standstill.
Afterwards we would go back down into the bunker feeling quite refreshed.
And everyone would be sitting around hopeless and full of despair.
Eva Braun was with us the last time we went up to the grounds for a walk and in the grounds of the next building, the Foreign Ministry she saw a very beautiful statue of a nymph beside a fountain.
She was so impressed that she went back into the bunker and said to the Führer, "You know, there's a statue up there and if you win the war, I'd like you to buy it for me."
And then he said:
"But I don't know who it belongs to.
It's state property.
I can't just buy it and put it in your private garden."
It's amazing, the things that went on.
Then she said:
"But if you do manage to triumph over the Russians you could make an exception just this once."
And it was really bizarre, you see, because conversations like that actually did take place, and then afterwards we would go back to discussing the best way to commit suicide.
The surest way is to shoot yourself in the mouth.
If you shoot yourself in the head you might end up like General Stiegler in Paris who shot himself in the head after the attack and only blinded himself.
And Eva said, "l want to be a beautiful corpse so I'll take the poison."
That paradoxical roller coaster of emotions left you feeling completely drained inside and quite numb.
Being in that situation, as I remember it was like being in a trance or a state of shock where you function automatically without analyzing your emotions or even really feeling them.
And some of the situations that arose were so weird.
Suddenly there was a rumor that Himmler had been holding peace negotiations with Count Bernadotte.
Then Hitler became incredibly worked up and suspicious because he thought one of the liaison officers with Himmler General Fegelein or an SS doctor called Stumpfegger might be involved in a conspiracy with Himmler to bring him out of the bunker alive.
He even turned Dr. Morell away when he came to give him his usual injections:
"Get out of my room and leave this place at once!"
He was afraid that someone might have been bribed to make an attempt to get him out of Berlin alive.
He had told everyone he wouldn't go, but they had all tried to persuade him.
Then Eva Braun, who suddenly developed a loyalty complex, said:
"And where's Speer?
Speer's your friend, isn't he?
He should be at your side during this difficult time."
And he said, "Listen, my child Speer has important things to do outside.
His place is where he has work to do, not in here with me."
And she replied, "But he is your friend, so he's bound to come."
In fact, Speer actually did come.
Yes, Speer came and had a long talk with Hitler.
I don't know what they discussed.
Hitler didn't say anything about it.
But Speer couldn't persuade him either and I don't even think he tried.
I almost think that at that moment Speer had decided not to carry out the scorched earth policy.
Afterwards it was said that he somehow tried to gas everyone in the bunker with gas in the air shaft.
But I'm not sure if that is true or if he intended to do it.
And then there was another startling turn of events.
Göring had been appointed vice-chancellor by that stage and he was at the Berghof.
Suddenly he sent a telegram saying, "My Führer since you have no more scope for action or decisions in Berlin I shall consider myself appointed your successor if I hear nothing from you by 2200."
This telegram had been received by Martin Bormann who still controlled the information that reached Hitler.
Nothing ever landed on Hitler's desk without Bormann seeing it first.
Bormann had handed the telegram to Hitler and presumably offered his interpretation.
In any case, Hitler regarded it as high treason and no doubt Bormann reinforced that view.
He gave the order for Göring and his entire staff to be arrested.
This act of betrayal made him much, much more suspicious.
He even ordered his brother-in-law, Fegelein, to be shot.
Although he had released Fegelein from his duties on the 22 of April:
"You may leave if you wish."
The people who had stayed behind had declared that it was their choice, but one day Fegelein vanished.
Fegelein wasn't just liaison officer with Himmler but also Eva Braun's brother-in-law.
He had married Eva's sister, Gretel.
And Gretel was expecting a baby.
She was in Munich.
Fegelein suddenly went missing.
Suddenly he wasn't to be found in the bunker.
Hitler wanted to see him, but he couldn't be found.
Then Eva managed to contact him in his apartment and he said to her, "l'm begging you...
And Eva replied, "Hermann, you know I'll never leave.
I want you to come here at once.
The Führer needs you."
Fegelein didn't turn up so someone was sent to fetch him, and he was completely drunk.
Then Hitler had him shot.
Eva shed many tears about that but she did accept it.
It was one more betrayal at a time when there was no hope left, a time when Hitler wanted to kill himself.
I could hardly comprehend what was going on because it was all so ambiguous.
And then, on 26 of April when everything was in flames around us with smoke billowing around and there were bomb craters everywhere on the main road in front of the Brandenburg Gate, a Storch light plane landed.
It was Hanna Reitsch, the aviator, and General von Greim.
He was wounded.
Enemy fighters had attacked them and Greim had a bullet in his leg.
Dr. Stumpfegger tended his wound and Hanna Reitsch beamed as she approached her beloved Führer.
I never saw a woman greet the Führer with such obsessive devotion with such willingness to die for him.
She wasn't passive, like Eva Braun.
She was a fighter.
Then she sang some lullabies with the Goebbels' children.
Greim was intended to succeed Göring so Hanna Reitsch was ready to make-
- What should I say a rallying call when she flew out of Berlin again.
And she got away safely.
But it was a macabre incident at the time.
Suddenly someone from the outside world burst into that trap we were in, and then flew off again spreading a message of hope.
We were left behind and it was only three more days to the bitter end.
I don't really know how we carried on, it was a shadowy existence.
We kept on handing round cups of tea and sitting there still hoping for something, still waiting.
But the counterattack with Wenck and Steiner never came off.
Other things did happen, though.
A girl who worked in the kitchen got married.
They fetched a registrar to the bunker.
Then someone brought the bride's parents in from the bombed city.
They got married, and then there was a party.
With the thunder of the artillery and shells bursting all around.
I think people were even dancing.
Someone had an accordion.
It really was a bizarre moment.
And then Hitler decided to poison his dog.
After Fegelein was executed and Himmler's treason became known, Hitler no longer trusted the cyanide Himmler had given him.
He wanted to test it on his dog to make sure it worked.
So then poor Blondie was poisoned.
The poison worked very well.
It left that smell of bitter almonds in the bunker which was terrible.
I remember thinking, "That is the worst thing of all dying down here in the bunker."
But that was only part of my feeling because I also felt there might just be some way out.
I was sitting outside the bunker one other time with Eva Braun, in the open air and at one very silent moment she said:
"Go on, give me a cigarette too."
And then she said, "l shall be weeping this evening."
And I said, "What do you mean?
Has the time come?"
"No, no," she said, "not that."
And that evening, it was the 28 of April.
That evening was when Hitler....
How did it happen?
Yes, Hitler married Eva Braun.
A registrar was fetched again and the two of them were married to the thunder of the Russian artillery.
When she signed her name Eva started writing a B, and then she changed it to an H.
So she emerged from that inferno as Frau Hitler and walked past the staff, who were lined up saying to them, "You may now call me Frau Hitler."
Before then the staff had always referred to her as "Fräulein."
Then they all went into the room were Hitler took tea in the evenings.
I was going to follow them.
But he said, "My child, have you rested a little?"
I said, "Yes."
And he said, "Please come into the next room I have some dictation for you."
And I thought to myself, "What does he want to dictate now?"
I went into the room, which was very bare with just one big table a bench against the wall and a few armchairs.
And he said, "Fetch a shorthand pad."
That was the first time.
I had never in my life taken shorthand from him.
I didn't have a pad with me, so I had to go and find one.
I sat down, and he started speaking.
Leaning forward at the desk, resting on his hands and with a blank expression, gazing into the distance.
He said, "My political testament."
And I thought to myself:
"Now I'm going to find out what really happened.
Now I'm going to find out why the war is lost.
He's going to make excuses and provide justifications.
Now he's going to explain everything."
Then he started speaking, and all of a sudden it was all the old phrases, "The Jews are to blame."
And, "The struggle was necessary in order to prevent a worse fate and save the world."
And, "The German people were not ready for their mission so they must perish." And, "National Socialism will die and nevermore rise again."
But he also named a government to succeed him.
Even while I was writing I thought I hadn't heard properly.
It was so incredible, it made no sense at all.
I finished writing that text.
And then he made his private testament.
If we were going to lose the war, and the enemy was going to treat us the way he always predicted then there would be no point writing either of those documents.
But he dictated them, he remembered his housekeeper.
He disposed of his pictures he settled a few more details, and then he said:
"Type up three copies as quickly as possible, my child."
So I went into a room which was a sort of office that the telephone operator also used.
I brought my typewriter, and I started typing up my shorthand notes.
I made far fewer mistakes than usual.
I don't know why.
I was typing so mechanically.
Normally I very often made typing mistakes but this time I think there were only two little mistakes.
You must remember there was no Tippex in those days and no correction key, so you had to rub out any mistakes.
With copies you had to put something in between so it didn't go through.
I wrote it up and I was able read it properly.
He kept on coming over.
By now everyone was sitting in Hitler's little living room and celebrating the wedding.
They toasted with champagne.
I wasn't there, but it must have been macabre.
There was just Goebbels, Bormann one of the adjutants who were left Frau Christian and of course Frau Goebbels.
Hitler kept coming over and asking, "Have you finished yet?"
I was working as fast as I could.
Then Goebbels came in.
His face was almost covered with tears with a completely bleak, defeated expression and he said, "Frau Junge, the Führer has ordered me to leave Berlin.
But I can't do it, I am the governor of Berlin my place is in Berlin, and at his side."
Then he dictated an appendix to the testament stressing that he was in a horrible situation because he could not obey Hitler's last order acknowledging that he would be described as disloyal, but insisting he couldn't act any other way.
He said his place was there, and he would put an end to his life.
But first, I must tell you this.
First Goebbels told the people of Berlin that their Führer was in Berlin and would take charge of defending the city.
Because it was always the way, wherever Hitler was the defenses held, and defeat was impossible.
That was one of the many big lies.
Well, I wrote all that, and then it was taken away.
The three copies were to be sent by three couriers:
One to Dönitz one to Schrammer and I don't remember about the third.
Anyway, the three copies of the testament were sent on their way.
Then Hitler said as soon as he received confirmation one arrived it would be time for him to make his farewell.
So we were left waiting again.
I destroyed the carbons and the shorthand notes, of course.
I don't remember how we got through that time.
There wasn't that much left, but it was still two days and two nights.
It was a nightmare.
And the children were still in the bunker with Frau Goebbels wandering around like a ghost with the poison in her bag.
At least we only had our own deaths to consider but she went through that six times.
She couldn't talk to her children anymore, either.
The children had been told, "You will have to be vaccinated because you're living so close to Uncle Hitler in the bunker, where there are lots of people."
The oldest, Helga, was 1 0 years old and she had such sad eyes.
She was so quiet that I felt she somehow sensed what was going on.
That was awful.
I simply don't remember how we spent the last days.
I can only remember one day, the 30 of April at about lunchtime, the children looked so lost.
I said, "Didn't you have any lunch?" "No, we're hungry."
So I took them to a place on the stairs between the central section of the bunker and the Führer's quarters where there was a sort of platform with a round table and a bench.
I made some lunch for the children.
Bread and butter with marmalade, I think.
They really enjoyed it and they started counting the direct hits because they felt so safe down in the bunker.
They knew there was no danger under 1 1 meters of concrete.
I'm sure I remember there was a bang and Helmut said, "That was a direct hit!"
And it seems to me that was the shot when Hitler--
Oh, I forgot, of course, Hitler said goodbye first.
That was on the 30.
Suddenly Linge appeared and said:
"Frau Junge and Frau Christian!"
We went to the big corridor outside Hitler's room and Günsche said:
"Come here, the Führer wants to say farewell."
I walked up to him like a waxwork doll and he was standing there with a completely distant expression.
He had already departed from this world.
He shook hands with me and gazed ahead blankly and then he said something I couldn't make out.
So I never understood the last words he spoke to me.
He turned round and shook hands with Frau Christian and Frau Manzialy.
Then Eva Braun gave me a hug and said:
"Frau Junge, try to get back home and say hello to Bavaria for me."
I should also tell you about Eva Braun's maid, Liesl.
She said to Frau Goebbels again and again:
"l'll take the children with me and try to get through!"
But Frau Goebbels just said, "No, that's impossible.
In a Germany, without National Socialism my children would have no chance.
I shall not expose them to scorn and ridicule."
You see, we didn't know we simply couldn't imagine what life outside would be like.
We had been so isolated all that time so cut off from real life, from the war and everything else and we had absolutely no idea what would happen after National Socialism.
Apart from the terrible visions Hitler had portrayed although they weren't at all clear.
All the men would be castrated Germany would be completely razed to the ground reduced to a primitive state without any industry and all the women would be raped.
They were visions from Bosch.
I was unable to imagine how life could continue.
So Liesl set off without the children and Hitler said his farewell.
I was sitting on the stairs with the children there was a bang, and Helmut said:
"That was a direct hit!" And I was convinced that was the final shot.
I stayed where l was, and after a while Otto Günsche came up the stairs from the Führer's bunker as white as a sheet and he said, "l have just obeyed the Führer's last order.
I have burnt his body."
I didn't go down to have a look for myself.
I went off somewhere so I could be alone.
There's a gap in my memory at this point.
Something was finally over.
It's a black hole in my mind.
And the first thing I remember is coming back to find the others and they were all sitting around in the big corridor drinking and smoking.
There was Bormann, General Burgdorf Goebbels was still there the adjutants, Linge and Günsche.
You know, I felt such hatred for Hitler because he had abandoned us a very personal hatred because he had simply gone off and left us stuck in that trap.
Suddenly the other people hanging around were like lifeless puppets when the person pulling the strings lets go.
None of us had lives of our own.
We all had poison in our pockets, but that was all.
I really had no idea what my next step should be.
Now I must have a break.
After Hitler's death, Frau Junge managed to escape from his bunker.
But her attempt to reach her mother in southern Germany failed.
On June 9, 1945, she was arrested by the Russians and remained their prisoner until December 1945.
Under house arrest, she was allowed to work in the Charité Hospital.
With the help of an Armenian who had served as interpreter during her interrogation by Russian officers she managed to escape to the Western Sector.
In May 1946 she reached her home in Bavaria.
There she was imprisoned by the Americans for three weeks in the Starnberg Castle prison.
After her release there was no real interest in her story.
In 1947 Traudl Junge, who had never been a member of the Nazi Party was "de-nazified" without any charges against her.
As a so-called "juvenile fellow traveler," she was granted juvenile amnesty.
In the early days after the war the past wasn't an issue, strangely enough.
It wasn't a subject to be discussed in public either.
And there weren't any books about it.
In politics there wasn't yet the process of coming to terms with the past.
Not even the Nuremberg Trials started that process the way it happened later, in the '60s.
I don't know exactly why, but suddenly there were so many books.
And lots of voices were raised.
We heard about the SS state and then the diary of Anne Frank and there were people who had survived the whole thing.
People who had resisted also spoke out.
The thing that made a very strong impression on me was that after the war the world wasn't at all the way Hitler had portrayed it and predicted it would be.
Suddenly there was a spirit of freedom and especially the Americans--
I didn't get home until a year after the occupation.
But especially the Americans turned out to be very good democrats and very helpful people.
The care parcels started coming.
I suddenly realized that none of it was true.
So in the early years it didn't really occur to me to come to terms with my past.
Naturally all the horrors that emerged in the Nuremberg Trials about the six million Jews and people of other faiths and beliefs who lost their lives-- All that struck me as very shocking.
But I wasn't able at first to see the connection with my own past.
I still felt somehow content that I had no personal guilt and had known nothing about it.
I had no idea of the extent of what happened.
But then one day I was walking past the memorial in Franz Josef Street to Sophie Scholl, a young girl who opposed Hitler and I realized that she was the same age as me and that she was executed the same year I started working for Hitler.
At that moment I really sensed that it is no excuse to be young and that it might have been possible to find out what was going on.
After the war Traudl Junge worked as a secretary at the magazine "Quick" as a consultant to director G. W. Papst on his film "Der letzte Akt" about Hitler's final days, on the staff of a literature magazine and as a science journalist.
Due to severe depression she went into early retirement.
From then on she spent a large part of her free time reading to blind people.
On the day this film premiered at the Berlin Film Festival on February 10, 2002 Traudl Junge died of cancer in a Munich hospital.
Shortly before her death, in a telephone conversation with André Heller and Othmar Schmiderer, she said:
"l think I'm starting to forgive myself."
That can really only happen when a tyrannical system is so well-established that it can dominate the entire fabric of society.
And the Germans are good at organizing.
People's consciences too?
Yes.
You see, that's an area where Hitler did a huge amount of harm.
He actually tried to manipulate the consciences of the German people.
He convinced them they had a task to do, they had to exterminate the Jews, because the Jews caused all our problems.
It wasn't Hitler's own idea it had been put forward much earlier.
That they had to make a sacrifice.
And I can remember a writer she interviewed a soldier who had been stationed in a concentration camp.
He was a guard, and she asked him:
"Didn't you feel any pity at all for the people you treated so badly there?"
And he replied, "Yes, I certainly did feel pity for them but I had to overcome it.
That was a sacrifice I had to make for the greater cause."
And that's what happened to conscience.
After all, Hitler always used to say:
"You don't have to worry, any of you you just have to do whatever I say, and I'll take responsibility."
As if anyone can take charge of another person's conscience.
I do think you can make someone's conscience more sensitive or desensitize it, or manipulate it.
Traudl Junge, n¨¦e Humps, was born in 1920 and was Hitler's secretary from 1942 until the end of the war.
She also took dictation for his last will and testament.
For more than 50 years she kept her memories to herself and remained silent about her life, her adversities and her distress.
Frau Junge married Hitler's manservant Hans Hermann Junge, in 1943.
Shortly thereafter he enlisted for frontline service and was shot and killed 14 months later in France during a low attack.
Starting in the mid-1950s, she lived in a one-bedroom flat in Munich.
In April and June 2001 several meetings with Frau Junge were arranged by author Melissa M¨¹ller which resulted in this film.
The longer I live, the older I get the more I feel this burden this feeling of guilt, because I worked for a man and I actually liked him, but he caused such terrible suffering.
You see, details came out later about what really happened in the concentration camps.
I read Viktor Klemperer's books, and it was much later, of course but it did give me the very strong sensation that all these problems at least began for the Jews right at the start, in 1933 or 1934.
And the feeling that I was so unaware and so thoughtless....
I didn't notice or pay attention.
That feeling has oppressed me more and more.
It seems to me that I should be angry with the child I was, that juvenile young girl or that I can't forgive her for failing to recognize in time what horrors that monster caused.
The fact that I didn't see what I was getting involved in and above all that I just said "yes" without thinking at all.
After all, it wasn't as though I were a fervent Nazi.
And when I went to Berlin, I could have said:
"No, I don't want that job I don't want to be sent to the F¨¹hrer's headquarters."
But I didn't do that, because I was simply too curious.
And I suppose I couldn't really imagine that destiny would drive me on and leave me in a situation that I had never aspired to at all.
But nevertheless I find it hard to forgive myself for everything.
I mean, of course today there's no doubt about it.
I have to say:
He was an absolute criminal.
He was a criminal-- It's just that I didn't realize it.
At some point afterwards I began to wonder if I should have seen that.
But then I think I was only 13 years old when he first came on the scene and I was quite late developing in lots of ways and after all, apart from me there were millions who didn't see that.
I mean, it's not as though everyone apart from me realized what a criminal he was.
And I try to take heart from those thoughts.
And Hitler did somehow embody something monumental at first, when I was a child.
The first time I met him he probably had a kind of paternal protective attitude towards me too and that's something I had longed for.
I'd never been able to follow my own inclinations and I'd never had that feeling of security in a complete family.
My mother did everything for us, it's true but I used to envy children who could say things like:
"My father says so and so," or "My father thinks...."
I used to think having a father must be very important.
Then I started working for Hitler, and suddenly I had that sense of security too.
There really was a certain kind of security in that...
I think I matured late, as well.
I think I had a very subservient attitude toward him as a father figure.
But that can easily be transformed into hatred, if your father disappoints you.
Unfortunately, my family was completely apolitical.
My mother brought us up by herself, and her father who was a general was really a tyrant in the house.
Devil at home and angel in company, people always used to say.
He wasn't at all interested in politics and the subject was never discussed.
We were brought up according to various other principles:
Doing without things, making sacrifices and backing down.
They were all seen as virtues, although today the attitude is virtually the opposite.
And I think I was incredibly conformist as a child.
I always had to do without things and make sacrifices because my mother had such a difficult time.
She ran the household for her father and since she didn't have any money, as a divorced woman he always made it clear to us that he was supporting us.
And there was always that pressure that mental and moral pressure surrounding the whole situation.
I actually ended up with Hitler by complete coincidence by chance and foolishness, I'd have to say.
When I was a young girl I didn't really have any exact ideas or plans that I wanted to achieve in my life, or any sense of wanting to be something.
And I couldn't go to high school because the school fees were a problem for my mother.
So I had to leave secondary school after the first state examination.
And then they said, "You'd better go to commercial school and get a job in an office, that's the quickest way to earn a living. "
And so that was to be my fate and I couldn't see any other chance at all.
I suppose I also felt awkward because I was the oldest and I was still at home while my younger sister was out in the big wide world.
Then she came up with an idea.
She said:
"l know, let's ask Albert Bormann if he can get you transferred to Berlin."
And I said all right, without any idea at all, of course what the consequences would be.
I ought to explain something else.
At that time, you see, which was 1941 I'd always thought that as well as working in an office I could satisfy my passion for dancing and I really wanted to go to dance school.
So in 1941 I took the entrance exam for dance school and the result was very good, so I thought I could escape from office work forever.
But they wouldn't let me leave the publishing company where I was working, because during the war you could only change your job with the permission of your employer.
And that made me so disappointed and so cross that I poured my heart out to my sister who was a dancer in Berlin by that time.
And then she got her best friend to talk to her brother-in-law, Albert Bormann, and ask him to have me transferred.
So that was a chance for me to get away from home and also get back at them in a way.
It was an act of defiance too against my employer, who didn't want to let me go.
I should also say that when I was in Berlin working in the F¨¹hrer's chancellery I never saw Hitler face to face at all.
I used to open his mail and read the love letters women would send him but he wasn't there in person at all.
None of the others ever saw him either.
He was in his personal headquarters far away from his outer office, you might say.
Then one day a typing competition was announced, throughout the whole of the chancellery complex and it was rumored that Hitler was looking for a young girl to be his secretary.
Albert Bormann absolutely insisted that I should take the test.
So I did, but I genuinely didn't have any real ambition to get the job because I was actually quite content with my life at that time.
Living with my sister was fine and the job was quite interesting....
Anyway, I took the typing test and apparently I was quite good even though I had the feeling that I was awful.
In any case, one day, I think it was in October or November, or later....
No, it was much later, it was early in December and the 10 best girls from the typing test were told to board the F¨¹hrer's special train and taken to the Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia.
At first we stayed on the F¨¹hrer's train which was in the grounds of the headquarters until Hitler had time to see us which took days, in the end.
And then, one night we were taken through a dark forest to the F¨¹hrer's bunker.
And that's where the decisive meeting actually took place.
It was a very unpleasant building, that bunker was and in the anteroom, the servant's area we all lined up.
There were some chairs with cork seats and we waited until Hitler came.
Now, I'd only ever seen him in newsreels and public appearances.
So I knew his military expression with his arm outstretched.
And then a kindly old gentleman came up to us speaking in a low voice and giving us a friendly smile.
He shook hands with each of us looked straight into our eyes with that famous gaze of his asked our names said a few words to us with a sort of friendly, paternal air and then disappeared again.
When he went he just said, "Good evening."
The experience of meeting him was completely different than I had imagined beforehand.
It wasn't at all frightening, and there was a harmless, peaceful atmosphere.
When it was over we said, "Now we're curious to know who he's chosen." And then Bormann said:
"Not so fast, now you'll have a trial dictation."
So I went for a trial dictation.
But Bormann sent another girl along with me, just in case because apparently Hitler had already had a nasty experience one time when he asked a secretary to write down something he wanted to dictate.
She was so nervous that she had a sort of hysterical fit and he was afraid of that happening again.
Well, I entered the room and I could feel how cold it was.
Hitler didn't like warm rooms.
And he was very friendly towards me, again.
"My child," he said, "Don't be nervous.
You can't possibly make as many mistakes as me.
Sit over here.
Shall I fetch a heater for you?"
He meant an electric heater.
We had special typewriters that were quiet.
They were called Silenta typewriters.
And then he started dictating something.
Well, I started typing, but I knew my hands were trembling so much that I didn't hit any of the right keys.
I stared down at the paper, and it looked like Chinese.
And then, thank God, or perhaps unfortunately his servant came in, Linge, and said to Hitler:
"My F¨¹hrer, Ribbentrop is on the phone."
So Hitler picked up the phone and talked for a while like any other boss would do.
And that gave me time to calm down and rewrite the sentence in correct German.
Then he dictated some more, and it was fine.
It was actually quite easy.
At the end I gave him the paper, and I went.
He was quite happy, and I was quite happy.
I did find it exciting.
I didn't know what had happened to me.
Suddenly there I was, little Traudl Humps, sitting opposite the F¨¹hrer.
And the F¨¹hrer himself, whatever you thought about him was a great man in those days.
It was such an extraordinary situation so incredible, such an adventure.
And then he called for me a few more times, to take dictation even though there were other secretaries available the two old secretaries.
I really liked being in the F¨¹hrer's headquarters, in the forest.
In fact, all my life I've disliked working those rigid office hours and sitting at a desk all day long.
And there was none of that there.
After all, Hitler didn't want someone in the outer office a secretary sitting there all day long, managing appointments and taking phone calls and making coffee for him.
The secretaries weren't stationed in an office at all.
They had their own apartments, their own rooms and were only called to take dictation.
He only dictated public speeches or private letters or some other personal things.
We never had to write anything about politics or military matters.
Then he called for me again and the two old secretaries were standing to his left and right and he said, "Fr?
ulein Humps now I should like to ask you if you wish to remain with me."
And then he said:
"You know, it's always a problem for me if I take pretty young secretaries.
Someone always marries them and whisks them off.
Maybe they should have to wear disfiguring ornaments like Negro women, in their lips."
And I must have been mad, because I said to him:
"My F¨¹hrer, you don't have to worry in this case.
I've been without a man for the last 22 years so it's no problem for me."
And he just burst out laughing.
At the time I didn't realize what nonsense I was talking.
"I've been without a man for the last 22 years!"
Now, I have to confess I couldn't really say "no" at that point.
I didn't have any reason to say, "No, I don't want to stay with you."
To be honest, I must admit I liked the idea.
In February '43, after Stalingrad things were really quite different though I didn't notice it very much because I was so new.
But the atmosphere in the F¨¹hrer's headquarters must have changed at that time.
There was an oppressive atmosphere.
Up until that time Hitler used to take his meals with his officers in the mess which of course meant that everyone would talk shop.
It wasn't very relaxing for him.
Then it occurred to him that he could take his meals with his secretaries and we were told not to bother him with questions about Stalingrad or other subjects.
He wanted to take it easy at mealtimes.
So it was arranged that of the four secretaries two would have lunch with him each day.
The other two would have dinner with him and the two from lunch would have a cup of tea with him at night.
You know, I never had the feeling that he was conscious of pursuing criminal aims.
For him they were ideals.
For him they were great goals.
And human life meant nothing to him in comparison.
But that only became so apparent to me afterwards.
You see, in the inner circle surrounding him in his private sphere I was shielded from the megalomaniac projects and the barbaric measures.
That was the awful thing, that's what gave me such a shock later, when I realized what had been happening.
When I started working there I thought I was at the source of information and in fact, I was in a blind spot.
It's like in an explosion, there's one place where calmness reigns.
And that was the great illusion the great, not disappointment, but the great Iie that I had made myself believe.
That same man who made speeches, when I think back with that rolling R and all that roaring and clipping his words I never heard him speak like that in private.
He could speak in such a flattering-- Such a modulated tone.
In his private life he had that gentle Austrian intonation too and he used some words that were typically Austrian.
For example, nimmermehr, or "nevermore" isn't used in Bavaria or the rest of Germany.
"l heard it nevermore." And things like that did fascinate me, really.
The courteous manner he displayed in his private life.
Apart from his stomach and digestive disorders, he gave the impression of being very healthy.
And he had to cope with an unhealthy way of life.
Far too little fresh air, far too little exercise.
He didn't smoke or drink alcohol although being healthy is more than that.
But his problems were all connected with the stomach and digestion.
And maybe that's the underlying reason why he had a vegetarian lifestyle, or such an unbalanced lifestyle.
He was very dependent on Dr. Morell, his personal physician.
And the doctor was a very exotic character.
He had been a ship's doctor, and he'd lived in India for years.
His approach to medicine was what I would today describe as "holistic."
With some homeopathic elements and natural remedies.
Dr. Morell had to help him a lot constantly giving him some sort of pills for his digestion or for gas, and he also gave him hormone and vitamin injections.
He used to swear by them.
I often used to ask Hitler's servant about his personal habits and he would tell me some things himself.
For example, he never liked being touched.
He didn't think much of massage or other things to do with the body.
And one time he said to me:
"l can't wear shorts because my knees are so white.
I'm not the athletic sort."
Or he once said:
"Eva always wants me to keep my back straight but I always say she should try it with such heavy keys in her pockets."
He used to talk a lot about private matters and also about quite personal things.
For instance, once the war had started he never wore anything but army gray.
Before the war he wore tails for formal occasions or his brown SA uniform.
It was a matter of principle for him.
He was a clean, well-groomed man.
For instance, he always washed his hands when he had been stroking his dog.
His dog Blondie meant an awful lot to him.
Blondie could provide a whole evening's entertainment.
He was convinced that she was incredibly clever and sophisticated an absolutely wonderful dog all around.
And she had a real fixation with him too.
Even though she had been trained by a dog trainer and was very well looked after.
I don't think Hitler fed the dog himself.
But I remember now that in Hitler's small bedroom in the bunker there was a big wooden box for Blondie, as well.
It was very large, in case she had puppies.
It was crowded in there with us all gathered around the bed.
If you wanted to leave, everyone had to stand up.
Well, anyway Blondie could do all sorts of tricks too.
She could bark when given a command and not just bark, she could sing!
She could make a sort of howling noise, and if Hitler said:
"Sing deeper, Blondie, sing like Zarah Leander" Blondie would sing an octave deeper.
He was very proud of that trick.
He was also immensely proud that she always obeyed him.
She really did obey his every word.
Sometimes he'd go for a walk with her in the grounds where lots of obstacles had been built and he was really pleased to see how clever she was.
Sometimes he'd throw a dumbbell for her but then she'd just pick it up at one end and it would hang down sideways.
Then he used to show us what she would do.
He'd put his head on one side and imitate Blondie gazing up at him, to check he was looking.
And he'd have to say, "Blondie, properly!"
And then she'd put it down properly.
He used to tell lots of stories like that and I think he really enjoyed it.
When I think about it now, and listen to what I'm saying all of these little stories sound so banal.
I think those characteristics of his the personal mannerisms he had aren't really at all important now because the total effect was so terrible.
I mean, at the time it was quite important for me, of course to see his human side.
But today it's almost as though I'd rather not describe these things so clearly.
Was there a moment a certain time, when you had the feeling that the issue of the Jews came up?
I'll tell you about one incident which took place at the Berghof when Himmler was also present, I think it was the only time.
Then he talked about concentration camps.
He said that there was what was called a "method" and it was managed quite cleverly.
So for example if someone was an arsonist, he was put on fire duty and you could be quite sure there would never be a fire.
That comment was the only time that the term concentration camp was ever mentioned there.
The word Jew was virtually never used in everyday speech.
The fact that Hitler would, at times say something in his speeches about "international Judaism" or "the Jews," that was virtually ignored.
Nobody ever raised the subject at least, not in our presence.
Actually, the only time I can remember the subject really being an issue was one evening at the Berghof when Frau von Schirach was a guest.
I wasn't there at the time, I only heard about it.
I was out of the room when it happened.
She was on fairly cordial terms with Hitler and she suddenly raised the subject.
She told the F¨¹hrer directly that it was quite terrible, the way the Jews were treated in Amsterdam.
They were packed into trains she said, and it was an inhumane way to behave.
It must have made him very angry and he said to her:
"Don't interfere in things you don't understand.
This mawkishness and sentimentality."
He really was very annoyed.
He walked right out of the room and didn't return.
And Frau Schirach was never invited to the Berghof again.
I think my husband told me about it.
He was there at the time.
It's something I often thought about since then....
You couldn't discuss anything with him that was somehow sensitive or difficult.
It was one aspect of him.
And that was really the only time a conflict situation developed.
But I sometimes think if I ever had the opportunity to meet Hitler again, in this life or in some other world I really would like to ask him what he would have done if he had found some Jewish blood in his own family.
Would he have gassed himself?
He didn't think in human dimensions.
Humanity was never of any importance to him.
It was always the concept of the superman the nation, always this abstract image of a vast German Reich, powerful and strong.
But the individual never mattered to him.
Though he always said he wanted to make people happy.
He started a variety of welfare and recreational organizations in the Third Reich.
Personal happiness was never of the slightest importance to him.
Love was quite alien to him?
He never really spoke about love.
In fact, I never heard him say the word.
That has just occurred to me.
His ideas on the subject were really what you'd almost call primitive.
The greatest hero deserves the most beautiful woman.
He once said that Robert Ley, the politician, had a beautiful wife and she must have been beautiful.
But in the same way that Brigitte Helm was as if she were made of marble, that amazingly regular, blond beauty.
Although I think she was incredibly boring.
He couldn't understand how a man with such a beautiful wife could be unfaithful with a less beautiful woman.
He couldn't imagine that a woman could have any other qualities apart from flawless beauty.
I don't think he really knew very much about women.
And I never had the feeling that his relationship with Eva had a very strong erotic element.
He certainly exerted considerable attraction, but I don't know whether I'm right about this, but I had the impression that he felt uneasy about anything erotic.
I can't really explain it.
I think he wasn't prepared to let himself go.
And that's a very important part of an erotic relationship, after all.
He really liked arranging marriages but if he was ever asked why he didn't marry, he'd say:
"l wouldn't be a good husband.
I couldn't allow myself to be."
And he probably wanted to maintain the image of an unmarried man for the sake of the female voters.
I mean, women were crazy about him.
I really don't know why.
He did once say something else on the subject.
He said, "Children are always a risk.
Sometimes the children of a genius turn out to be cretins."
And even though I was such a naive young girl it struck me as very odd.
How can anyone regard himself as a genius?
It made me flinch inside.
The 20 of July, 1944 was a particularly hot, oppressive day.
Frau Christian and I took advantage of the weather that morning to go for a bicycle ride outside the restricted area, to a little lake where we could swim around and lie in the sun for a while.
We didn't say a word to each other, we were just dreaming.
When the sun was high in the sky, and we knew it must be noon we decided it was time to start back.
We didn't know if the situation report meeting had started and we might have been needed earlier in any case.
When we got back to the camp the officers' cars were parked there, so the meeting was still in progress.
We went to our room and all of a sudden there was a terrible bang.
There were often loud noises if a deer stepped on one of the land mines or there was an air-raid exercise, or a new weapon was being tested.
We didn't think anything of it.
But then suddenly there was a huge uproar outside.
Someone called the doctor.
We raced out of the barracks, and somehow we could tell that something had happened.
Then we ran towards the F¨¹hrer's bunker and there were soldiers running towards us, saying:
"You can't go any further, there's been a bomb explosion."
But we didn't know whether the F¨¹hrer had been hit or any details about what had happened.
Then we headed for the building where the meeting had taken place and we wanted to go inside but just then someone came towards us covered in blood, General Jodl, I think and Major Weizenegger, one of the staff officers and they said to us:
"There's no access here, you can't go on.
You'll have to turn back."
It really was a big shock for us because it made us wonder what would happen to us if the F¨¹hrer really had been killed how things could carry on.
There were all sorts of wild thoughts in our heads:
"What will happen to us?"
Or, "Who could continue to lead us in the war after the F¨¹hrer?"
It really was an atmosphere of extreme panic.
We went back to our room and waited there.
Then Otto G¨¹nsche came to see us.
He looked very disheveled and anxious but he said, "No need to worry, nothing happened to the F¨¹hrer.
He's in his bunker now and you can go and see him, if you like."
So we made our way to the F¨¹hrer's bunker and he was standing in the anteroom.
He looked so funny, we almost burst out laughing.
His hair was standing on end his trousers were hanging in tatters but he greeted us with an almost triumphant smile, and said:
"l have been saved.
Destiny has chosen me, providence has preserved me.
It is a sign that I must see my mission through to the end.
Those cowards were too scared to open fire and risk their own lives they planted a bomb."
He was raging and cursing and he thought the construction squad that had just built the barracks might have hidden a bomb in the floor of the building.
Then we left him.
He told us with great pride that Dr. Morell had taken his pulse, and it was quite normal.
He just had some bruises on his right arm, which hurt him so he kept it inside the jacket of his uniform.
At the time we were very relieved because after all, we had been spared a huge change that would have affected us in ways we could hardly imagine.
We had dinner with him that evening.
No, that afternoon Mussolini came for a visit.
Hitler was very proud when he showed him the site of the explosion.
He explained that the building had been completely destroyed.
It was a fairly flimsy structure.
And of course he stressed again that it was an act of fate, an act of divine providence that the meeting had not been held in the bunker as originally planned.
Since the bunker wasn't finished, it had been moved to the barracks.
If it had been in the bunker, he said:
"l would no longer be alive."
But very soon afterwards something came to light that shocked him to the very core.
He was in talks to establish how the attack had been mounted when suddenly the telephone operator came up to him and said:
"My F¨¹hrer, Colonel Stauffenberg has left the barracks.
He said he was going to make a phone call, but he didn't."
Apparently he used that as a pretense to leave the barracks but the telephone operator said, "He didn't make any phone calls."
So straight away suspicion fell on certain officers instead of the construction squad and of course the information was sent to Berlin immediately.
Goebbels was informed, and in Berlin the whole apparatus was set in motion.
The Army Supreme Command stepped in, or was informed and Goebbels contacted Colonel Remer who was in command of the greater Deutschland regiment.
They occupied the radio station, and other important sites too, I think so everything went very, very wrong for Stauffenberg.
Meanwhile in the F¨¹hrer's headquarters this betrayal by senior staff officers naturally caused a huge panic.
Hitler flew into a rage.
He started cursing the cowards who wanted to get rid of him and had absolutely no idea what would happen in Germany and throughout Europe if he were no longer alive if Judaism were once more in power, full of hatred that would destroy Germany, the whole of Europe and the entire culture.
"They have no idea," he said "what our enemies plan to do with Germany and Europe."
The Western powers would never be powerful enough to resist Bolshevism, he claimed.
Only he had the capacity to do that and he would not be prevented from carrying out his mission.
There was no other solution, Germany had to win the war.
By this time he had worked himself up into an almost euphoric mood.
And the incident made him feel even more certain he was on the right path.
I have often wondered whether it might have been possible before then, when the situation wasn't so absolutely terrible, for him to say:
"l can't win the war."
Perhaps he would have said at some point:
"l have to make peace." But after the attack any hope of that was completely in vain.
He felt so reinforced in his beliefs and that evening he made a speech to the German nation saying he had been saved in a miraculous way and telling us we had to stake everything on winning the war.
"We must triumph!" That stupid, "We must triumph because triumph we must!"
Hitler always used to say, "lt is impossible for Bolshevism to be victorious.
I am the only one who can prevent that.
Without Germany, the Western powers are not strong enough to halt this avalanche."
He was convinced of that but he must also have seen that victory was impossible.
I actually think he had lost touch with reality.
He simply no longer had his feet firmly on the ground.
So then he wanted to make a clean sweep and drag everyone else down with him.
As for myself, deep in my heart I did have some doubts, and I wondered:
"ls all this absolutely right?"
But then to question the situation actually to initiate a discussion would have taken more courage.
And I think it's also the case that if you value and respect someone you don't really want to destroy the image of that person you don't want to know, in fact if disaster lies behind the fa?
ade.
I don't think he considered war a light-hearted matter.
He regarded it as a terrible thing although he never said so.
For instance, whenever there were reports of air raids and people described the situation, or if I said something like:
"My F¨¹hrer, you can't imagine how miserable it is for all those homeless people whose houses have been bombed it's just so terrible."
He'd stop me right away and say:
"l know exactly how it is, but we shall strike back.
We shall take revenge, and with our new weapons everything will change.
Vengeance will be ours!"
He would always say that, and in particular he'd say that we would rebuild everything after the war and make it better than ever.
I think there was a general policy of denial.
He never did see a city that had been badly bombed.
We traveled through Germany in the special train with the blinds down and when he reached Anhalter Station in Berlin at night the chauffeur would take the streets that weren't so badly damaged.
Another thing, he would never have flowers in his room.
He hated to have dead things around.
And that's strange, when you think about it.
Someone who kills thousands of people doesn't want dead flowers in his room, beautiful flowers.
With a sort of last thirst for life, Eva Braun tried to organize one final party.
She took the people who were still there back up to her old living quarters and played one single record called, "Red Roses Tell You of Love. "
There was dancing and champagne and she was almost hysterically cheerful.
But there was a forced, desperate atmosphere and it was eerie.
The Russian rocket launchers provided an accompaniment.
I was there for a while, but then I left.
I was in a very miserable mood.
Then I went down to the bunker, where I had sleeping quarters and I tried to get some sleep.
The following day, which was the 22 of April Hitler called a meeting to discuss the situation.
All the officers from the general staff came along General Krebs, General Burgdorf and all the adjutants.
All of a sudden he opened the door of the conference room walked out into the anteroom, to his study and sent for us.
I mean the women who were still there:
Frau Christian and me and the cook, Fr?
ulein Manzialy and Eva Braun.
And he said:
"All is lost.
You must leave Berlin at once."
His face was like a mask of stone.
In fact, it already looked as though he were wearing a death mask.
We stood there, completely stunned and then Eva Braun walked up to him took both his hands in hers and said:
"But you must know I'll stay with you.
I shall never leave you."
And then he leaned forwards and for the first time that anyone had ever seen he kissed her on the lips.
Then Frau Christian and I both said:
"I'm staying here."
I don't know why I said it.
I suppose I couldn't imagine where else to go.
And I felt quite anxious, in a way.
I was scared of leaving that secure environment.
Maybe I didn't really believe it was so serious, as well.
Then he said, "l shall shoot myself."
And he added:
"l only wish my generals had as much courage as you."
Then we left the room and everyone from the meeting was standing there.
Their faces were either red or as white as corpses.
And they stood completely still.
I don't remember what I did after that.
The whole situation had somehow left me in a state of shock.
But life went on, at least for a while.
Hitler insisted there was no way of saving the situation although the generals kept on trying to persuade him there were some possibilities.
But after the 22 of April there was one disaster after another.
Then all personnel who could be spared left and headed south.
Hitler's chief adjutant, a man called Schau was an old warrior from the early days, a loyal follower and he had to pack all the private documents and papers in a box.
He burnt some of them in front of the bunker and he put the others in the last plane to leave.
Then he had to get away himself.
He had to set off for Munich, so he could do the same thing there.
Sort through all the files and documents and destroy some of them.
He parted from the F¨¹hrer with tears in his eyes.
Fr?
ulein Wolf and Fr?
ulein Schr?
der also had to leave Berlin and those of us who were left started to lead a sort of shadowy existence.
We lost track of whether it was day or night.
We would have meals without knowing what we were eating.
We still tried to conduct conversations but from that point on, most of the talk was really about the best, most certain and most painless way to put an end to our lives.
Naturally we said to Hitler, "Why don't you try to get away?"
His reply was, "l do not wish to fall into enemy hands alive."
So we said, "Why do you insist on killing yourself?"
He said, "l do not want the enemy to take me alive.
I have no strength to fight at the head of my troops and none of my loyal followers will shoot me when I ask them to.
So I shall have to do it myself."
At that point he obtained some poison capsules from Himmler.
We asked for some too.
The stories about what the Russian troops did to the women when they occupied German towns were so terrible and frightening that we also asked if we could have cyanide capsules for use in an emergency.
He gave us some tablets, and as he did so, he said:
"l would have preferred to give you a nicer farewell gift."
We were also allowed to learn to shoot.
Although for some time we had been shooting at targets in the grounds of the chancellery.
We had requested this before, back in East Prussia but he had refused.
Now he granted our request.
Eva Braun joined in.
A couple of days later, it must have been about the 24 of April Goebbels happened to see me in the corridor, and he said:
"Frau Junge, my family will now be moving into the F¨¹hrer's bunker.
See to it that the children are given somewhere to sleep."
I passed the message on to the household steward or the director of the F¨¹hrer's living quarters and a room was provided for the children.
There were bunk beds for the children, all set up.
Not long afterwards Frau Goebbels came along with the six children.
The children were in a good mood and happy that they could be with Uncle Hitler.
I suppose someone said, "We'll be safer in here."
I don't think they had begun to suspect that it was going to be a very, very bad time all around.
Naturally all through this period there was a terribly tense atmosphere everywhere.
What was going to happen in this last round of attack and defense?
Reports would come from the front but without providing any real news.
There were always crisis meetings that broke up without any hope.
There were no more attacks and there was no more defense.
Because Hitler had given up all hope and he had withdrawn, withdrawn into himself.
He became completely numb and apathetic and he would just sit in the corridor with one of the puppies.
Blondie had had puppies by then.
They lived in a small room in the bunker a washroom.
He would sit there with a puppy in his lap, staring ahead blankly.
We didn't know what he was waiting for but the officers kept on trying....
Suddenly they came along with a suggestion that General Wenck who was heading west with his army at the time could turn back and meet up with General Steiner coming down from the north.
Then it should be possible to save Berlin.
That gave Hitler a new lease of life.
He started to show an interest in the situation again there were more meetings, and we would sit around.
By now we didn't know if it was day or night.
There were no more regular mealtimes.
Nothing was done with any ceremony anymore.
People even started smoking in Hitler's presence.
There were still conversations around the dinner table.
And still tea in the evening.
Though Hitler was very apathetic then and the mood was very subdued which was naturally to be expected.
And there were also a few attempts at a kind of gallows humor like, "Chin up while you've still got one!"
It was an awful time.
We all acted somehow as if we were automatons, without....
I simply can't remember any genuine feelings at all.
It was like drifting and not really being yourself at all.
You have to imagine what the situation was like.
The deafening roar of artillery and air raids the completely ghostly atmosphere against a background of constant noise.
But despite everything sometimes when there was a break in the shelling and it was quiet up top, I'd go outside with Eva Braun and Frau Christian, into the grounds.
And it was spring up there!
The narcissuses were in bloom, there were buds on the trees the sun was shining, and somehow that raised our hopes again made us feel alive again because nature had not come to a standstill.
Afterwards we would go back down into the bunker feeling quite refreshed.
And everyone would be sitting around hopeless and full of despair.
Eva Braun was with us the last time we went up to the grounds for a walk and in the grounds of the next building, the Foreign Ministry she saw a very beautiful statue of a nymph beside a fountain.
She was so impressed that she went back into the bunker and said to the F¨¹hrer, "You know, there's a statue up there and if you win the war, I'd like you to buy it for me."
And then he said:
"But I don't know who it belongs to.
It's state property.
I can't just buy it and put it in your private garden."
It's amazing, the things that went on.
Then she said:
"But if you do manage to triumph over the Russians you could make an exception just this once."
And it was really bizarre, you see, because conversations like that actually did take place, and then afterwards we would go back to discussing the best way to commit suicide.
The surest way is to shoot yourself in the mouth.
If you shoot yourself in the head you might end up like General Stiegler in Paris who shot himself in the head after the attack and only blinded himself.
And Eva said, "l want to be a beautiful corpse so I'll take the poison."
That paradoxical roller coaster of emotions left you feeling completely drained inside and quite numb.
Being in that situation, as I remember it was like being in a trance or a state of shock where you function automatically without analyzing your emotions or even really feeling them.
And some of the situations that arose were so weird.
Suddenly there was a rumor that Himmler had been holding peace negotiations with Count Bernadotte.
Then Hitler became incredibly worked up and suspicious because he thought one of the liaison officers with Himmler General Fegelein or an SS doctor called Stumpfegger might be involved in a conspiracy with Himmler to bring him out of the bunker alive.
He even turned Dr. Morell away when he came to give him his usual injections:
"Get out of my room and leave this place at once!"
He was afraid that someone might have been bribed to make an attempt to get him out of Berlin alive.
He had told everyone he wouldn't go, but they had all tried to persuade him.
Then Eva Braun, who suddenly developed a loyalty complex, said:
"And where's Speer?
Speer's your friend, isn't he?
He should be at your side during this difficult time."
And he said, "Listen, my child Speer has important things to do outside.
His place is where he has work to do, not in here with me."
And she replied, "But he is your friend, so he's bound to come."
In fact, Speer actually did come.
Yes, Speer came and had a long talk with Hitler.
I don't know what they discussed.
Hitler didn't say anything about it.
But Speer couldn't persuade him either and I don't even think he tried.
I almost think that at that moment Speer had decided not to carry out the scorched earth policy.
Afterwards it was said that he somehow tried to gas everyone in the bunker with gas in the air shaft.
But I'm not sure if that is true or if he intended to do it.
And then there was another startling turn of events.
G?
ring had been appointed vice-chancellor by that stage and he was at the Berghof.
Suddenly he sent a telegram saying, "My F¨¹hrer since you have no more scope for action or decisions in Berlin I shall consider myself appointed your successor if I hear nothing from you by 2200."
This telegram had been received by Martin Bormann who still controlled the information that reached Hitler.
Nothing ever landed on Hitler's desk without Bormann seeing it first.
Bormann had handed the telegram to Hitler and presumably offered his interpretation.
In any case, Hitler regarded it as high treason and no doubt Bormann reinforced that view.
He gave the order for G?
ring and his entire staff to be arrested.
This act of betrayal made him much, much more suspicious.
He even ordered his brother-in-law, Fegelein, to be shot.
Although he had released Fegelein from his duties on the 22 of April:
"You may leave if you wish."
The people who had stayed behind had declared that it was their choice, but one day Fegelein vanished.
Fegelein wasn't just liaison officer with Himmler but also Eva Braun's brother-in-law.
He had married Eva's sister, Gretel.
And Gretel was expecting a baby.
She was in Munich.
Fegelein suddenly went missing.
Suddenly he wasn't to be found in the bunker.
Hitler wanted to see him, but he couldn't be found.
Then Eva managed to contact him in his apartment and he said to her, "I'm begging you...
And Eva replied, "Hermann, you know I'll never leave.
I want you to come here at once.
The F¨¹hrer needs you."
Fegelein didn't turn up so someone was sent to fetch him, and he was completely drunk.
Then Hitler had him shot.
Eva shed many tears about that but she did accept it.
It was one more betrayal at a time when there was no hope left, a time when Hitler wanted to kill himself.
I could hardly comprehend what was going on because it was all so ambiguous.
And then, on 26 of April when everything was in flames around us with smoke billowing around and there were bomb craters everywhere on the main road in front of the Brandenburg Gate, a Storch light plane landed.
It was Hanna Reitsch, the aviator, and General von Greim.
He was wounded.
Enemy fighters had attacked them and Greim had a bullet in his leg.
Dr. Stumpfegger tended his wound and Hanna Reitsch beamed as she approached her beloved F¨¹hrer.
I never saw a woman greet the F¨¹hrer with such obsessive devotion with such willingness to die for him.
She wasn't passive, like Eva Braun.
She was a fighter.
Then she sang some lullabies with the Goebbels' children.
Greim was intended to succeed G?
ring so Hanna Reitsch was ready to make-
- What should I say a rallying call when she flew out of Berlin again.
And she got away safely.
But it was a macabre incident at the time.
Suddenly someone from the outside world burst into that trap we were in, and then flew off again spreading a message of hope.
We were left behind and it was only three more days to the bitter end.
I don't really know how we carried on, it was a shadowy existence.
We kept on handing round cups of tea and sitting there still hoping for something, still waiting.
But the counterattack with Wenck and Steiner never came off.
Other things did happen, though.
A girl who worked in the kitchen got married.
They fetched a registrar to the bunker.
Then someone brought the bride's parents in from the bombed city.
They got married, and then there was a party.
With the thunder of the artillery and shells bursting all around.
I think people were even dancing.
Someone had an accordion.
It really was a bizarre moment.
And then Hitler decided to poison his dog.
After Fegelein was executed and Himmler's treason became known, Hitler no longer trusted the cyanide Himmler had given him.
He wanted to test it on his dog to make sure it worked.
So then poor Blondie was poisoned.
The poison worked very well.
It left that smell of bitter almonds in the bunker which was terrible.
I remember thinking, "That is the worst thing of all dying down here in the bunker."
But that was only part of my feeling because I also felt there might just be some way out.
I was sitting outside the bunker one other time with Eva Braun, in the open air and at one very silent moment she said:
"Go on, give me a cigarette too."
And then she said, "l shall be weeping this evening."
And I said, "What do you mean?
Has the time come?"
"No, no," she said, "not that."
And that evening, it was the 28 of April.
That evening was when Hitler....
How did it happen?
Yes, Hitler married Eva Braun.
A registrar was fetched again and the two of them were married to the thunder of the Russian artillery.
When she signed her name Eva started writing a B, and then she changed it to an H.
So she emerged from that inferno as Frau Hitler and walked past the staff, who were lined up saying to them, "You may now call me Frau Hitler."
Before then the staff had always referred to her as "Fr?
ulein."
Then they all went into the room were Hitler took tea in the evenings.
I was going to follow them.
But he said, "My child, have you rested a little?"
I said, "Yes."
And he said, "Please come into the next room I have some dictation for you."
And I thought to myself, "What does he want to dictate now?"
I went into the room, which was very bare with just one big table a bench against the wall and a few armchairs.
And he said, "Fetch a shorthand pad."
That was the first time.
I had never in my life taken shorthand from him.
I didn't have a pad with me, so I had to go and find one.
I sat down, and he started speaking.
Leaning forward at the desk, resting on his hands and with a blank expression, gazing into the distance.
He said, "My political testament."
And I thought to myself:
"Now I'm going to find out what really happened.
Now I'm going to find out why the war is lost.
He's going to make excuses and provide justifications.
Now he's going to explain everything."
Then he started speaking, and all of a sudden it was all the old phrases, "The Jews are to blame."
And, "The struggle was necessary in order to prevent a worse fate and save the world."
And, "The German people were not ready for their mission so they must perish." And, "National Socialism will die and nevermore rise again."
But he also named a government to succeed him.
Even while I was writing I thought I hadn't heard properly.
It was so incredible, it made no sense at all.
I finished writing that text.
And then he made his private testament.
If we were going to lose the war, and the enemy was going to treat us the way he always predicted then there would be no point writing either of those documents.
But he dictated them, he remembered his housekeeper.
He disposed of his pictures he settled a few more details, and then he said:
"Type up three copies as quickly as possible, my child."
So I went into a room which was a sort of office that the telephone operator also used.
I brought my typewriter, and I started typing up my shorthand notes.
I made far fewer mistakes than usual.
I don't know why.
I was typing so mechanically.
Normally I very often made typing mistakes but this time I think there were only two little mistakes.
You must remember there was no Tippex in those days and no correction key, so you had to rub out any mistakes.
With copies you had to put something in between so it didn't go through.
I wrote it up and I was able read it properly.
He kept on coming over.
By now everyone was sitting in Hitler's little living room and celebrating the wedding.
They toasted with champagne.
I wasn't there, but it must have been macabre.
There was just Goebbels, Bormann one of the adjutants who were left Frau Christian and of course Frau Goebbels.
Hitler kept coming over and asking, "Have you finished yet?"
I was working as fast as I could.
Then Goebbels came in.
His face was almost covered with tears with a completely bleak, defeated expression and he said, "Frau Junge, the F¨¹hrer has ordered me to leave Berlin.
But I can't do it, I am the governor of Berlin my place is in Berlin, and at his side."
Then he dictated an appendix to the testament stressing that he was in a horrible situation because he could not obey Hitler's last order acknowledging that he would be described as disloyal, but insisting he couldn't act any other way.
He said his place was there, and he would put an end to his life.
But first, I must tell you this.
First Goebbels told the people of Berlin that their F¨¹hrer was in Berlin and would take charge of defending the city.
Because it was always the way, wherever Hitler was the defenses held, and defeat was impossible.
That was one of the many big lies.
Well, I wrote all that, and then it was taken away.
The three copies were to be sent by three couriers:
One to D?
nitz one to Schrammer and I don't remember about the third.
Anyway, the three copies of the testament were sent on their way.
Then Hitler said as soon as he received confirmation one arrived it would be time for him to make his farewell.
So we were left waiting again.
I destroyed the carbons and the shorthand notes, of course.
I don't remember how we got through that time.
There wasn't that much left, but it was still two days and two nights.
It was a nightmare.
And the children were still in the bunker with Frau Goebbels wandering around like a ghost with the poison in her bag.
At least we only had our own deaths to consider but she went through that six times.
She couldn't talk to her children anymore, either.
The children had been told, "You will have to be vaccinated because you're living so close to Uncle Hitler in the bunker, where there are lots of people."
The oldest, Helga, was 10 years old and she had such sad eyes.
She was so quiet that I felt she somehow sensed what was going on.
That was awful.
I simply don't remember how we spent the last days.
I can only remember one day, the 30 of April at about lunchtime, the children looked so lost.
I said, "Didn't you have any lunch?" "No, we're hungry."
So I took them to a place on the stairs between the central section of the bunker and the F¨¹hrer's quarters where there was a sort of platform with a round table and a bench.
I made some lunch for the children.
Bread and butter with marmalade, I think.
They really enjoyed it and they started counting the direct hits because they felt so safe down in the bunker.
They knew there was no danger under 11 meters of concrete.
I'm sure I remember there was a bang and Helmut said, "That was a direct hit!"
And it seems to me that was the shot when Hitler--
Oh, I forgot, of course, Hitler said goodbye first.
That was on the 30.
Suddenly Linge appeared and said:
"Frau Junge and Frau Christian!"
We went to the big corridor outside Hitler's room and G¨¹nsche said:
"Come here, the F¨¹hrer wants to say farewell."
I walked up to him like a waxwork doll and he was standing there with a completely distant expression.
He had already departed from this world.
He shook hands with me and gazed ahead blankly and then he said something I couldn't make out.
So I never understood the last words he spoke to me.
He turned round and shook hands with Frau Christian and Frau Manzialy.
Then Eva Braun gave me a hug and said:
"Frau Junge, try to get back home and say hello to Bavaria for me."
I should also tell you about Eva Braun's maid, Liesl.
She said to Frau Goebbels again and again:
"I'll take the children with me and try to get through!"
But Frau Goebbels just said, "No, that's impossible.
In a Germany, without National Socialism my children would have no chance.
I shall not expose them to scorn and ridicule."
You see, we didn't know we simply couldn't imagine what life outside would be like.
We had been so isolated all that time so cut off from real life, from the war and everything else and we had absolutely no idea what would happen after National Socialism.
Apart from the terrible visions Hitler had portrayed although they weren't at all clear.
All the men would be castrated Germany would be completely razed to the ground reduced to a primitive state without any industry and all the women would be raped.
They were visions from Bosch.
I was unable to imagine how life could continue.
So Liesl set off without the children and Hitler said his farewell.
I was sitting on the stairs with the children there was a bang, and Helmut said:
"That was a direct hit!" And I was convinced that was the final shot.
I stayed where I was, and after a while Otto G¨¹nsche came up the stairs from the F¨¹hrer's bunker as white as a sheet and he said, "l have just obeyed the F¨¹hrer's last order.
I have burnt his body."
I didn't go down to have a look for myself.
I went off somewhere so I could be alone.
There's a gap in my memory at this point.
Something was finally over.
It's a black hole in my mind.
And the first thing I remember is coming back to find the others and they were all sitting around in the big corridor drinking and smoking.
There was Bormann, General Burgdorf Goebbels was still there the adjutants, Linge and G¨¹nsche.
You know, I felt such hatred for Hitler because he had abandoned us a very personal hatred because he had simply gone off and left us stuck in that trap.
Suddenly the other people hanging around were like lifeless puppets when the person pulling the strings lets go.
None of us had lives of our own.
We all had poison in our pockets, but that was all.
I really had no idea what my next step should be.
Now I must have a break.
After Hitler's death, Frau Junge managed to escape from his bunker.
But her attempt to reach her mother in southern Germany failed.
On June 9, 1945, she was arrested by the Russians and remained their prisoner until December 1945.
Under house arrest, she was allowed to work in the Charit¨¦ Hospital.
With the help of an Armenian who had served as interpreter during her interrogation by Russian officers she managed to escape to the Western Sector.
In May 1946 she reached her home in Bavaria.
There she was imprisoned by the Americans for three weeks in the Starnberg Castle prison.
After her release there was no real interest in her story.
In 1947 Traudl Junge, who had never been a member of the Nazi Party was "de-nazified" without any charges against her.
As a so-called "juvenile fellow traveler," she was granted juvenile amnesty.
In the early days after the war the past wasn't an issue, strangely enough.
It wasn't a subject to be discussed in public either.
And there weren't any books about it.
In politics there wasn't yet the process of coming to terms with the past.
Not even the Nuremberg Trials started that process the way it happened later, in the '60s.
I don't know exactly why, but suddenly there were so many books.
And lots of voices were raised.
We heard about the SS state and then the diary of Anne Frank and there were people who had survived the whole thing.
People who had resisted also spoke out.
The thing that made a very strong impression on me was that after the war the world wasn't at all the way Hitler had portrayed it and predicted it would be.
Suddenly there was a spirit of freedom and especially the Americans--
I didn't get home until a year after the occupation.
But especially the Americans turned out to be very good democrats and very helpful people.
The care parcels started coming.
I suddenly realized that none of it was true.
So in the early years it didn't really occur to me to come to terms with my past.
Naturally all the horrors that emerged in the Nuremberg Trials about the six million Jews and people of other faiths and beliefs who lost their lives-- All that struck me as very shocking.
But I wasn't able at first to see the connection with my own past.
I still felt somehow content that I had no personal guilt and had known nothing about it.
I had no idea of the extent of what happened.
But then one day I was walking past the memorial in Franz Josef Street to Sophie Scholl, a young girl who opposed Hitler and I realized that she was the same age as me and that she was executed the same year I started working for Hitler.
At that moment I really sensed that it is no excuse to be young and that it might have been possible to find out what was going on.
After the war Traudl Junge worked as a secretary at the magazine Quick as a consultant to director G. W. Papst on his film Der letzte Akt about Hitler's final days, on the staff of a literature magazine and as a science journalist.
Due to severe depression she went into early retirement.
From then on she spent a large part of her free time reading to blind people.
On the day this film premiered at the Berlin Film Festival on February 10, 2002 Traudl Junge died of cancer in a Munich hospital.
Shortly before her death, in a telephone conversation with Andr¨¦ Heller and Othmar Schmiderer, she said:
"l think I'm starting to forgive myself."
Good morning
This will do wonders for tourism
Yes
(sighs)
Who called it in?
A jogger from the Loews found the victims at 6:15
"Victims"?
I'm only seeing one victim
No, there was a girl down there, a Jane Renshaw age 24, here from Iowa
She was beat to hell, unconscious, and half drowned
She's over at St. Luke's
Well, they made sure he was dead
You get an ID?
No.
She was too out of it to help
Mmm-hmm
He was running away
Why kill a guy who's running from the scene?
Yes ... therein lies the rub, my friends for the evidence, as always will speak for itself
Why'd you die so far from the girl, heh?
What's he telling you, Alexx?
Sustained blunt-force trauma to the head
Multiple blows, based on the blood
Liver temperature is 87.2
So he died around midnight
Jugular
Not a knife, though
Irregular object
Bled out
What's this mark on his cheek right there?
Burn mark
A little bit of ash and something brown
Smashing and slashing aren't enough
Gotta burn him, too, huh?
If I'm going to mess somebody up like this
I don't do it out in the open
Mmm.
Unless you're not worried about it
Male victim's hair is black
Yep.
Got blonde here just like the female vic
So, our guy and girl grab a blanket have a little fun in the moonlight
Until they are rudely interrupted
She's assaulted tossed in the ocean, left to die
The guy tries to escape
Half dead, scared out of his mind he runs ... and someone catches up to him over here
So that makes these the last footsteps of his life
Megan Donner
Be right there
SART nurse
They've completed her exam.
We can talk to her now
Keep me posted
Got it
Who wants to help me search around the girl?
We're working on the murder scene
You asked for the girl?
I like a challenge
Tide could come in at any moment
Too much.
Hey, check this out
What do you got?
Still sharp, no erosion
Damn good chance that could be from last night
Yeah
This is everything she had on
Any indication of rape?
Recovered what looks like semen
Tears on the lower part of her vagina
Six, seven and eight o'clock
Also a grade three concussion
She give you a name?
She suffered a pretty severe trauma
She doesn't remember the last twelve hours
Oh, listen
She got antsy when I tried to administer an oral swab
Sense memory
She's repressing
And she's right on the edge
I'll see what I can do
Thanks, Megan
Hi, Jane
My name's Megan Donner
I'm a Crime Scene Investigator
They said I was attacked
We don't know by whom
They won't tell me if my boyfriend, Paul, is okay
Paul Varnette
We don't know yet
Uh ... right now
I'd like to concentrate on you
We have evidence of a sexual assault
If we're going to find the person who did this to you
I need your help
The more evidence we collect from you the better our chance of catching him
Would you let me complete the exam?
Thanks
Can you open?
That's good
That's good
Do you wear a retainer?
Mm-hmm
Would it be okay if I removed it?
Uh ...
I'm going to, um ... take this for now, okay?
Mmm, Detective Fenwick will be here in a few minutes
He needs to ask you some questions about Paul
I'll be right outside
What are you up to?
Sand's from the hot area around the male victim
Didn't you already sieve around that area?
Yeah, but, uh, there was a struggle and the paramedics came through
Sometimes things get buried so I dug a little deeper
Oh, my gosh, aren't you ambitious?
Here, look at this
Nosepiece from eyeglasses
That's right
A little phenol and some of this ...
This ... proof of blood
Pink always was my favorite color
I'll get this over to DNA
Oh, I'll take it
- I'm going that way anyway
- You sure?
- Yeah
- Great
Something in the neck wound
Looks like glass
We found a lot of broken glass at the scene
Approximately five meters from the victim's body
Is your glass green in color?
Copy that
Hmm.
So that means somebody jabbed our guy with a broken bottle, doesn't it?
Interesting because I'm thinking he was a bartender
Based on?
Lime peel in his fingernails and these rashes
Occupational dermatosis
You can get it from squeezing a lot of lemons or limes in direct sunlight
The female victim stated that her boyfriend was a CPA
Maybe he moonlights
It also says the boyfriend has light brown hair
This guy's is black
Check his eye color, please
Green
CPA has brown
You know what that means?
This ... ain't her boyfriend
This ain't her boyfriend, but it might be why he's on your table, Alexx.
Thank you.
Detective Fenwick, this is Horatio Caine
Meet me at the female victim's hotel, the Agramonte
That's right, the Agramonte I'm on my way
Thank you, Alexx
Hey, who are you guys?
Paul Varnette?
What's going on?
Well, Paul, your girlfriend, Jane, is in the hospital and the guy she was with last night is dead and you look like you've been up all night so why don't you tell me?
Hey, Fenwick
Got here as fast as I could
Traffic on the causeway
Hmm
I can't believe someone did this to Jane
When was the last time you saw her?
Maybe eleven
We were at a party and I passed out
I woke up at the guest house an hour ago
Mm, cubanos?
These are illegal, you know
I got them from a guy at the airport
I'm going to take them into evidence if you don't mind
I don't understand
Not important that you do
How did you get those cuts on your hands?
I ... don't know
I was drunk
The Hamilton's throw a good party
The Hamilton's?
Governors, Senators, war hero Hamilton's?
Yeah.
I went to business school with Tyler Hamilton at Vanderbilt
He always said if we were in Miami we had an open invitation
Pretty girl like Jane, I don't doubt it
You know the family?
I do
Have you, um ... ever seen him before?
- No
- Hmm
Look, I haven't done anything
I never saw this guy and I never hurt Jane
Paul, did you teach Jane a lesson for stepping out on you?
No.
No way
Then you wouldn't mind giving us a DNA sample to rule you out?
No problem
But listen ...
Jane and I did have sex recently
How recently?
Yesterday before the party
Open up
Yesterday ...
Thank you
We were playing around and things got kind of rough
If you find anything ...
You'll be the first to know
Oh, this guy is a friend of the Hamiltons
Let's not let him out of our sight, okay?
Horatio Caine
Come ahead
Thank you
Nice suit
I'm pulling out my fall stuff
I heard you got something from the beach
A nose piece with blood evidence
The lab has it now
- Hmmm
- I'm surprised the Hamiltons are still here
Usually they're in Vermont this time of year
It's almost peak foliage
Calleigh, you seem to know as much about this family as you do about nine millimeters
They're American royalty
What can I say?
Mm-hmm.
Eric, stay off their property but take a look around
You got it, H
Here we go
Horatio, good to get your call
I don't think you've been here since ...
- It's been a while
- Yeah
Calleigh Duquesne, Detective Fenwick
Nice to meet you all
Please come in
Sorry about the circumstances
Any leads on that beach attack?
It's all over the news
Actually we think the victims were at your party last night
You're kidding?
No, I'm not
Well, it wasn't my party
- It was my nephew Tyler's
- Hmm
Past my bedtime
We'd like to talk to him
Certainly.
Right this way
Yeah, Paul's a buddy of mine from school
His girlfriend's the woman that got raped?
That's right
Geez.
So, who's the guy who got killed?
We think he may have tended bar at your party last night
- I-I don't recognize him
- No?
But if she's okay can't she tell you who he is?
We're looking at that
Paul says he didn't go down to the beach last night that he slept in your guest house.
Yeah, he was pretty messed up.
I let him crash
You mind if I look at the guest house to confirm his story?
I'm afraid I wouldn't be comfortable with that, Horatio
We are merely trying to find evidence that could exonerate your friend
And we're cooperating
Tyler will tell you everything that he knows
But if you want to conduct a search legally you need a warrant
- That's true
- Horatio?
Yeah
Interesting bottle
The green glass is similar to the glass we found in our male victim
Every house on this beach serves that kind of champagne
Every wine and liquor store in the area sells it
Look, if I let you take it then the tabloids will be calling this a raid
I won't put my family through that
Mr. Hamilton a terrible thing has happened just outside your property line
Well, just like that attack on Hobe Beach
Horatio, you know what Miami has turned into
Look at the gangs before you point to my family ... or our friends
I'll keep that in mind
State's attorney's office says we might be able to get a warrant for this place
At least the guest house
We have one chance to get a warrant against these people
The first judge that turns us down we're dead so let's motor on that
What do you got?
I got the name of a bartender who left early last night and still hasn't shown up to collect his share of the tips
It's Estevan Ordonez
Guatemalan, temporary visa, no relatives
Black hair, green eyes?
I'll tell you later
Guess whose prints were on that busted bottle we found at the beach?
Paul Varnette, the boyfriend
Paul touched a champagne bottle that ended up on the beach
Champagne bottle's the murder weapon
I tested it
Identical float density to the glass found on the dead guy's neck
So, Paul catches his girl with Estevan
Offs the guy, assaults the girl
It's going to be hard to prove rape
Paul admitted he and Jane had consensual sex yesterday
What's the microscope say?
Ten spermatozoa per field of view
Fifty percent still have their tails
Timeline fits his story but that still doesn't explain the oral cop
Retainer from Jane's mouth
Found skin on the inside of the screw
Take a look at this
It could be her tongue
Thin epidermis, lots of blood vessels and the sebaceous glands are separate from the hair follicles
We're talking penis-- tore off
Ouch
You might want to get a good hold of yourself
Why?
Still have to chop it up; confirm it's Paul's
Oh ...
I compared the burn residue on the male victim's face to the tobacco in Paul's cigar
High concentrations of lanthanum and uranium in both samples
Same brand, same soil
That's right
So, Paul kills Estevan, puts the cigar out on his face as a personal touch for stealing his girl
Staggers back to the guest house and sleeps the whole thing off
One problem
I just ran the penile tissue from Jane's retainer compared it to Paul's DNA
Mm-hmm
It's not a match
But his prints are on the murder weapon
Maybe he didn't do this alone
Maybe he did the killing While somebody else sexually assaulted his girlfriend
We know you didn't do this alone
I didn't do anything
Paul, in all of your photographs you're wearing the watch that you purchased at the airport
We found the receipt in your room
Forty-nine bucks and water resistant down to one hundred fifty feet
And now you're sporting that hunk of Switzerland
Hmm, 13 thou worth of gold
Paul ...
I don't think you can afford a watch that expensive, do you?
Everyone ...
Ryan Cutler
I'm on retainer with the Hamilton's
They asked me to represent you as a friend of the family
Paul, if you buy into this the Hamilton's will hang you out to dry in two seconds
Like you aren't?
Paul, the less said ...
You're innocent?
Explain it to us
Stop goading him!
Paul ... this man is not your attorney
You did not hire him
This is about you
This is your life
Paul ...
Paul ?
It was kind of a gift
From?
"Just one kiss ... just one kiss."
That's all he kept saying
Who?
Tyler Hamilton
Come on, she gives me one kiss
I'll trade you my watch
Come on!
Just one kiss
I'll trade you my watch
Look, she was upset
Really, babe
It's no big thing
It's friends
I told her I was sorry
I grabbed a bottle of champagne I said, "let's go."
She grabbed the bottle and she walked off
I lost track of her
I figured she went down to the beach
I stayed and I got drunk
But you didn't follow her out to the beach
No
But I should have.
I screwed up
Yes, you did
Yes, you did
Had you not traded her, none of this would have happened but that's the past
- Paul, let's go
- Paul?
I need to take a look at your watch
If you want me to buy your story,
I need to look at that watch
Hmm ... what do you got?
Paul was telling the truth
Found three sets of male DNA on this watch
Okay
Separate out Paul and then cross-reference the unknowns with Jane's retainer.
Let's do that
You got it
Drake?
Horatio
I'm here for a DNA sample
Have you got a warrant?
This is your opportunity to clear your name
I suggest you take it
We have been through this, Horatio
Yes, we have
Back when I was a green CSI and driver's side airbags were standard issue
Lucky for you though, huh?
Not so lucky for the young girl you had in the car
And I have never forgotten your help
You know what I haven't forgotten?
That chemical burn on your arm from the airbag
And your watch imprint
I haven't forgotten those things either
Well, you have some memory
Seen this before?
Yeah, it's the watch I gave my nephew a few months ago
Where did you find it ?
There are skin cells embedded in the band
Skin cells?
Did you know that our entire genetic code is stored in a single cell?
Now, in this case I have the DNA of two males one of which forced Jane Renshaw to have oral sex and the other one is a close relative
Now, which one are you?
I was with her on the beach
In a sexual way, you know?
Why didn't you mention this before?
Paul's my friend
Besides, once I hit that mousetrap in her jaw it was pretty much over
That must have been disappointing, huh?
Killed the mood
I'll tell you that much
I left her alone out there.
I went back to the guest house, went to bed
You didn't see Estevan the bartender, out there?
No
You got your clothes from that night?
In the guest house
I'm going to need them
Sure, if my uncle says it's okay
Look, he's already admitted to a consensual act, Horatio
Let it go
A man was murdered out here
Yes, but the girl is the one who'll pay
The press will eat her alive
Protect her
Are you suggesting that I protect a woman?
That's rich
More Hamilton hardball?
I'm officially over them
Can you forgive me for ever thinking they were all that?
Well, I made the same mistake myself once
What do we have?
Filed with the city
Public access ... so's the beach
And the property line ends here
What's this right here?
Boardwalk dock
It's also a public access
We'll take that
Wait a minute
I've got blood drops right here
More over there
Pattern's exclamation points
Spines point in the direction of travel
Yes, they do
And this being the public access ... ours for the taking
Horatio!
The blood you found belongs to Estevan Ordonez
Of course, we can't tell if it's from him or someone with his blood on them
Okay, but it doesn't matter because a murdered man's blood leads up to the Hamilton house
We got the warrant
Hey... hey!
We're not even sure what we're looking for
We never are, but I'd be happy with Tyler's clothes from that night, a shirt shoes, anything
Unless, of course ... he already burned them
You know what that means
Dig in
That's one way to bury your past
They've had plans to put in a tennis court for months
Check with the contractor
Oh, we are, believe me
Horatio, if I had known...
You knew
I want a DNA sample from both of them
- just because we can, okay?
- Yep
Open wide
Relax.
I won't jam it in too hard
I'm going to head back to the lab, guys
Okay
I'll see you there
Hey, guys
Hamilton men -- try as they might cannot hide their zippers
Very carefully, please
Zippers from a guy's medium-sized warm-up jacket manufactured by Fubu
It's the same kind that
Tyler was wearing the night of the party according to the pictures from homicide
You look for trace?
Isolated fragments of glass in the zipper teeth
Glass melts at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit
Yes, but a wood fire only gets up to a thousand and the Hamilton's couldn't have known that
Density matches the murder weapon
Tyler clobbers the guy ... and glass rains down on his jacket
It's weird how one kiss can turn into such a mess
The cigar you asked me to process from the guest house
Same tobacco as the burn on Esteban's face
Saliva
Tyler's
And the material in the end?
Silica
A.k.a. beach sand
Let's go talk to the young Mr. Hamilton
Nice going
So, Tyler, you pony up the $1,300 watch for just one kiss and the young lady runs off with the bartender anyway
That kiss is going to cost you a lot more than a watch
So, what ... the bartender changes into his street clothes and the girl walked off with him?
You just went out there to razz the guy for stealing your girl
But once you saw that lowly bartender kissing the girl who blew you off the old Hamilton arrogance turned into rage
And you have what you claim to be consensual sex
Oh, no!
And then you leave the young woman alone to die in the water
If you say so
But that wasn't enough
You go the extra yard and you burn the man's face
He ran, you caught up and you cut his throat with what was left of that champagne bottle
You're way off
Then why don't you educate us?
Excuse me
I know this is going to be good
What's going on?
Tyler Hamilton doesn't wear glasses
Excuse me?
The nosepiece from the glasses at the crime scene?
Surfer in DNA triple-checked it
Found blood from our dead guy on it
Transfer or spatter?
Direct spatter, medium force
The only way you get spatter on a nosepiece is to be there when the murder's happening
I know.
But Tyler Hamilton doesn't wear glasses so it can't be Tyler's nosepiece
- Drake wears glasses
- Bring him in
- Okay
- Thank you
Drake
Yes, Horatio
I'm going to need your glasses
For what?
Either you take them off or I'm going to take them off you
You decide
Good decision
Now sit down
You did this
In an attempt to wipe away the blood, Drake you merely pushed it to the corner of your lens
So, slit jugular wet blood you had to be inches away
I, um ...
I heard a scream
And by the time I got down to the beach...
Mr. Hamilton?
Hamilton?
!
Mr. Hamilton?
Mr. Hamilton?
No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!
Someone help!
Help!
There's been a murder!
Somebody help!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Sorry, unc
Shut up
Get out of those clothes
Again, you have made this statement against my counsel
Oh, let it go, Cutler
You're looking at life
Are you aware of that?
Without parole
What a waste
What a waste
You said ... our entire genetic makeup ... is in one cell
How do we escape that?
Your family?
You stop procreating
Thank you
Taxi's downstairs
I'll walk you
Jane
Bad idea, Paul
Can I talk to you ... please?
I'll meet you in the lobby
I had no idea Tyler was going to hurt her
She has to know that
I love her
If you loved her you wouldn't have traded her for a watch
Hey
Mind if I join you?
Not at all
Hamiltons are all over the tv tube
Deja vu
The old case?
Mm-hmm
Fifteen years ago
I wasn't on the job then
Hmm
July 25th, 1987
I found Drake Hamilton's car by the side of the road after a terrible accident
Girl in the front seat dead No Drake
Went up to the Hamilton residence where I was received like a diplomat glad-handing, promises, blah-blah-blah
"Drake'll be right down."
Well, he did come down four hours later with three attorneys in tow and a story about how Drake lent the girl the car
So with no clothes at the scene solid alibi and a mysterious chemical burn on his forearm we had nothing
No charges were ever filed
He walked
No investigation
M.E. later told me that the girl bled out and that all he had to do was call 911 from the road and she would have lived
He didn't do that
Horatio, you got him now
Got him now
I would have nailed him fifteen years ago, though
Let's hope for the next one
Hmm, let's do that
Morning.
This would do wonders for tourism.
Yes.
Who called it in?
Jogger from the Lowles found the victims at 6:15.
Victims?
I'm only seeing one victim.
No, there was a girl down there.
A Jane Renshaw.
Age 24.
Here from Iowa.
She was beat the hell, unconscious and half drowned.
She's over at St. Luke's.
Well they made sure he was dead.
Did you get an I.D.?
No, and she was too out of it to help.
He was running away.
Why kill a guy who's running from the scene?
Yes, there in lies the rub my friend.
The evidence, as always, will speak for itself.
Why did you die so far from the girl, huh?
What's he telling you Alexx?
Sustained blunt force trauma to the head.
Multiple blows based on the blood.
Liver temperature is 87.2.
So he died around midnight.
Juggular.
Not a knife though.
Irregular object.
Bled out.
What's this mark on his cheek right there?
Burn mark.
Little bit of ash.
Something brown.
Smashing and slashing aren't enough.
Gotta burn him too huh.
If I'm gonna mess somebody up like this, I don't do it out in the open.
Unless you're not worried about it.
Male victim's hair is black.
Got blond here.
Just like the female vic.
So our guy and girl grab a blanket;
have a little fun in the moonlight.
Until they are rudely interrupted.
She's assaulted.
Tossed into the ocean left to die.
Guy tries to escape.
Half dead, scared out of his mind, he runs.
And someone catches up to him over here.
So that makes these the last footsteps of his life.
Megan Donner.
I'll be right there.
Sart nurse.
They've completed their exam.
We can talk to her now.
Keep me posted.
Got it.
Who wants to help me search around the girl?
We're working on the murder scene.
You ask for the girl?
I like a challenge.
Tide can come in at any moment.
Too much.
Hey check this out.
What have you got?
It's still sharp.
No erosion.
Damn good chance that could be from last night.
This is everything she had on.
Any indication of rape?
We recovered what looks like semen.
Tears on the lower part of her vagina.
Six, seven and eight o'clock.
Also a grade three concussion.
She give you a name?
She suffered a pretty severe trauma.
She doesn't remember the last twelve hours.
Oh listen.
She got antsy when I tried to administer an oral swab.
Sense memory.
She's repressing.
She's right there on the edge.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks Megan.
Hi Jane.
My name is Megan Donner.
I'm a crime scene investigator.
They said I was attacked.
We don't know by whom.
They won't tell me if my boyfriend Paul's okay.
Paul Vernet?
We don't know yet.
Right now, I'd like to concentrate on you.
We have evidence of a sexual assault.
If we're gonna find the person who did this to you...
I need your help.
The more evidence we collect from you, the better our chance of catching him.
Would you let me complete the exam?
Thanks.
Can you open?
That's good.
That's good.
Do you wear a retainer?
Would it be ok if I removed it?
I'm gonna, um, take this for now, ok?
Detective Fenwick will be here in a few minutes.
He needs to ask you some questions about Paul.
I'll be right outside.
What are you up to?
Sands from the hot area around the male victim.
Didn't you already sift around that area?
Yeah.
But there was a struggle, paramedics came through, sometimes things get buried.
So I dug a little deeper.
Oh my gosh.
Aren't you ambitious.
Yeah, look at this.
Nose piece from eyeglasses.
That's right.
Proof of blood.
Pink always was my favorite color.
I'll get this over to DNA.
I'll take it.
I'm going that way anyways.
You sure?
Great!
Something in the neck wound.
Looks like glass.
We found a lot of broken glass at the scene.
Approximately five meters from the body.
Is your glass green in color?
Copy that.
So that means somebody jabbed our guy with a broken bottle, doesn't it.
Interesting.
Because I'm thinking he was a bartender.
Based on?
Lime peel on his fingernails.
And these rashes.
Occupational dermatosis.
You can get it from squeezing a lot of lemons or limes in direct sunlight.
Female victim stated that her boyfriend was a CPA.
Maybe he moonlights.
Also said the boyfriend had light brown hair.
This guy's is black.
Check his eye color please.
Green.
CPA has brown.
You know what that means.
This ain't her boyfriend.
This ain't her boyfriend but it might be why he's on your table Alexx.
Thank you.
Detective Fenwick.
This is Horatio Caine.
Meet me at the female victim's hotel.
The Agramont.
That's right the Agramont.
I'm on my way.
Thank you Alexx.
Who are you guys?
Paul Varnette?
What's going on?
Well Paul, your girlfriend, Jane, is in the hospital.
The guy she was with last night is dead... and you look like you've been up all night, so why don't you tell me.
Got here as fast as I could.
Traffic on the causeway.
I can't believe someone did this to Jane.
When's the last time you saw her?
Maybe eleven.
We were at a party and...
I passed out.
I woke up at the guest house an hour ago.
Cubanos.
These are illegal you know.
I got them from a guy at the airport.
I'm going to take them into evidence, if you don't mind.
I don't understand.
It's not important that you do.
How did you get those cuts on your hands.
I don't no.
I was drunk.
Hamilton's throw a good party.
THE Hamiltons?
Governors, Senators, war heroes Hamiltons?
I went to business school with Tyler Hamilton at Vanderbilt.
You know, he said, if we were in Miami, we had an open invitation.
Pretty girl like Jane, I don't doubt it.
You know the family?
I do.
Have you, um, ever seen him before?
No.
Look I haven't DONE anything?
I never saw this guy and I never hurt Jane.
Paul, did you teach Jane a lesso for stepping out on you?
NO!
No way.
Then, you won't mind giving us a DNA sample.
To rule you out.
No problem.
But listen, I uh, Jane and I did have sex recently.
How recently?
Yesterday.
Before the party.
Open up.
Thank you.
We were playing around and...things got... kinda rough.
If you find anything...
You'll be the first to know.
Oh, this guy is a friend of the Hamiltons.
Let's not let him out of our sight, ok?
Horatio Caine.
Come in.
Thank you.
Nice suit.
I'm pulling out my fall stuff.
I heard you got something from the beach.
A nosepiece with blood evidence.
Lab has it now.
I'm surprised the Hamiltons are still here.
Usually they're in Vermont this time of year.
All this peak foliage.
Calleigh, you seem to know as much about this family as you do about 9 millimeters.
They're American royalty.
What can I say?
Eric stay off the property but take a look around.
You got it H.
Here we go.
Horatio.
Good to get your call.
I don't think you've been here since, huh...
A while.
Calleigh Duquesne, Detective Fenwick.
Nice to meet you all.
Please come in.
I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Any leads on that beach attack?
It's all over the news.
Actually we think the victims...
we at your party last night.
You're kidding.
No, I'm not.
Well, I wasn't my party.
It was my nephew, Tyler's.
It was past my bedtime.
We'd like to talk to him.
Certainly.
Right this way.
Yeah, Paul's a buddy of mine from school.
His girlfriend is the woman who got raped?
That's right.
Geez.
So who's the guy who got killed?
We think he may have tended bar at your party last night.
I, I don't recognize him.
But if she's ok, can't she tell you who he is?
Well, we're looking at that.
Paul says he never went down to the beach last night.
That he slept in your guest house.
Yeah, he was pretty messed up.
I let him crash.
Mind if I take a look at the guest house to confirm his story?
I'm afraid I wouldn't be comfortable with that Horatio.
We are merely trying to find evidence that could exonerate your friend.
And we're cooperating.
Tyler will tell you everything that he knows.
But if you want to conduct a search, legally you need a warrant.
That's true.
Horatio.
Interesting bottle.
Green glass is similar to the glass we found on the male victim.
Every house on this beach serves that kind of champagne.
Every wine and liquor store in the area sells it.
Look if I let you take it then the tabloids will be calling this a raid.
And I won't put my family through that.
Mr. Hamilton, a terrible thing has happened just outside your property line.
Well, just like that attack on Hobe beach.
Horatio, you know what Miami has turned into.
Look at the gangs before you point at my family or our friends.
I'll keep that in mind.
State's attorney says we might be able to get a warrant to search this place.
At least the guest house.
We have one chance to get a warrant against these people.
The first judge who turns us down we're dead, so let's motor on that.
What have you got?
Got the name of a bartender who left early last night.
Still hasn't shown up to collect his share of the tips.
It's, ah, Estebban Ordonez.
Guatamalan.
Temporary visa, no relatives.
Black hair, green eyes?
I'll tell you later.
Guess who's prints were on that busted bottle.
The one that we found on the beach.
Paul Varnette.
The boyfriend.
Paul touched the champagne bottle that end up on the beach.
Champagne bottle is the murder weapon.
I tested it.
Identical float density to the glass found in the dead guy's neck.
So Paul catches his girl with Estebban.
Tossed the guy.
Assaults the girl.
It's gonna be hard to prove rape.
Paul admitted he and Jane had consensual sex yesterday.
What's the microscope say.
Ten spermatazoa per view.
Fifty percent still have their tails.
Timeline fits his story but that still doesn't explain the oral cop.
Retainer from Jane's mouth.
Found skin on the inside of the scope.
Take a look at this.
Can't be her tongue?
Thin epidermis.
Lots of blood vessels and the sebacious glands are separate from the hair follicles
We're talking penis tore off.
You might want to get a good hold of yourself.
Why?
Still have to chop it up.
Confirm it's Paul's.
I compared the burn residue from the male victim's face to the tobacco in Paul's cigar.
High concentrations of lantinum and uranium in both samples.
Same brand, same soil?
That's right.
So Paul kills Estebban, puts the cigar out on his face as a personal touch for stealing his girl.
Staggers back to the guest house and sleeps the whole thing off.
One problem.
I just ran the penile tissue from Jane's retainer.
Compared it to Paul's DNA.
It's not a match.
But his prints were on the murder weapon.
Maybe he didn't do this alone.
Maybe he did the killing..
While somebody else sexually assaulted his girlfriend.
We know you didn't do this alone.
I didn't DO anything.
Paul, in all of your photographs you're wearing a watch purchased at the airport.
We found the receipt in your room.
49 bucks and water resistent down to 150 ft.
And now you are sporting that hunk of Switzerland.
Huh, 13 thou worth of gold.
Paul, I don't think you can afford a watch that expensive.
Do you?
Good morning everyone.
Brian Coupler.
I'm on retainer for the Hamiltons.
They asked me to represent you as a friend of the family.
Paul, if you buy into this, the Hamiltons will hang you out to dry in two seconds.
Like you aren't?
Paul you don't..
If you're innocent, explain it to us.
Stop goading him.
Paul, this man is not your attorney.
You did not hire him.
This is about you, this is your life.
It was kind of a gift.
From?
Just one kiss.
Just one kiss.
That's all he kept saying.
Who?
Tyler Hamilton.
Com'on.
Just one kiss.
Trade you my watch.
Com'on.
Just one kiss.
Trade you my watch.
She was upset.
Com'on.
It's no big thing.
It's friends.
I told her I was sorry.
I grabbed a bottle of champagne.
I said let's go.
She grabbed the bottle.
She walked off.
I lost track of her.
I figured she went down to the beach.
I stayed and I got drunk.
But you didn't follow her out to the beach.
No.
But I should've.
Look I screwed up.
Yes you did.
Yes you did.
Had you not traded her, none of this would've happened.
But that's the past.
Paul let's go.
I need to take a look at your watch.
If you want me to buy your story, I need to look at your watch.
What have you got?
Paul was telling the truth.
Found three sets of male DNA on this watch.
Ok.
Separate out Paul... and then cross-reference the unknowns with the sample from the retainer.
Let's do that.
You got it.
Drake.
Horatio.
I'm here for DNA sample.
Have you got a warrant?
This is your opportunity to clear your name.
I suggest you take it.
We have been through this Horatio.
Yes we have.
Back when I was a green CSI and driver's side airbags weren't standard issue.
Lucky for you though, huh.
Not so lucky for the young girl you had in your car.
I have never forgotten your help.
You know what I haven't forgotten?
That chemical burn on your arm on that airbag.
And your watch imprint.
I haven't forgotten those things either.
Well, you have some memory.
Seen this before?
Yeah, it's the watch I gave my nephew a few months ago.
Where did you find it?
There are skin cells embedded in the band.
Skin cells.
Did you know that our entire genetic code is stored in a single cell.
Now in this case, I have the DNA of two males.
One of which forced Jane Renshaw to have oral sex.
And the other one is a close relative.
Now.
Which one are you?
I was with her on the beach.
In a sexual way, you know?
Why didn't you mention this before?
Paul's my friend.
Besides, once I hit that mouse trap in her jaw, I was pretty much over.
That must have been disappointing huh.
Killed the mood.
I'll tell you that much.
I left her alone out there;
I went back to the guest house.
I went to bed.
You didn't see Estebban the bartender out there.
No.
Do you have your clothes from that night?
In the guest house.
I'm gonna need them.
Sure if my uncle says it's okay.
He's already admitted to a consensual act, Horatio.
Let it go.
A man was murdered out here.
Yes, but the girl is the one who will pay.
The press will eat her alive.
To protect her...
Are you suggesting that I protect a woman?
That's rich.
More Hamilton hardball?
I'm officially over them.
Can you forgive me for ever thinking that they were ever all that?
Well, I made the same mistake myself once.
What do we have?
Filed with the city.
Public access.
So is the beach.
And the property line ends here.
What's this right here?
Boardwalk dock.
That's also a public access.
We'll take that.
Wait a minute.
I've got blood drops right here.
More over there.
Pattern exclaimation points.
Spots point the direction of the path.
Yes they do.
And this being a public access.
Ours for the taking.
Blood you found belongs to Estebban Ordonez.
Of course we can't tell if it was from him or someone with his blood on 'im.
Ok but it doesn't matter because the murdered man's blood leads up to the Hamilton's house.
We got the warrant.
HEY!
HEY!
We're not even sure what we're looking for.
We never are.
But be happy for Tyler's clothes from that night.
Shirt, shoes, anything.
Unless of course he already burned them.
You know what that means.
Dig in.
That's one way to bury your past.
We've had plans to put in a tennis court for months.
Check our contract.
Oh we are.
Believe me.
Horatio, if I had known.
You knew.
I want a DNA sample from both of them.
Just because we can.
Okay?
Open wide.
Relax.
I won't jam it in too hard.
I'm gonna head back to the lab guys.
See you there.
Hey guys.
Hamilton men, try as they might, cannot hide their zippers.
Very carefully please.
Zipper's from a guy's medium size warm up jacket.
Manufactured by Fubu.
It's the same kind that Tyler was wearing at the, uh, night of the party according to the pictures from homicide.
You look for trace?
Isolated fragments of glass in the zipper teeth.
Glass melts at 2700 degree Fahrenheight.
Yes but wood fire only gets up to one thousand and the Hamiltons' couldn't have known that.
Density matches the murder weapon.
Tyler clobbers the guy.
And glass rains down on his jacket.
It's weird how one kiss can turn into just a mess.
Cigar you asked me to process from the guest house.
Same tobacco as the burn on Estebban's face.
Saliva.
Tyler's.
And the material on the end, silica.
Aka beach sand.
Let's go talk to the young Mr. Hamilton.
Nice going.
So Tyler.
You pony up the 13 thousand dollar watch for just one kiss.
And the young lady runs off with the bartender anyway.
Bet that kiss is gonna cost you a lot more than your watch.
So what.
The bartender changes into his street clothes, and the girl walked off with him?
You just went out there to razz the guy for stealing your girl.
But once you saw that lowly bartender kissing the girl that blew you off, the old Hamilton arrogance turned into rage.
And you have what you claim to be consensual sex.
And then you leave the young woman alone to die in the water.
If you say so.
But that wasn't enough.
You go the extra yard and you burn the man's face.
He ran.
You caught up and you cut his throat with what was left of that champagne bottle.
You're way off.
Then why don't you educate us.
Excuse me.
I know this is gonna be good.
What's going on.
Tyler Hamilton doesn't wear glasses.
Excuse me?
The nose piece from the glasses at the crime scene.
DNA tripled checked it and found blood from our dead guy on it.
Transfer spatter.
Direct spatter, medium force.
The only way you get spatter from a nose piece is to be there when the murder's happening.
I know but Tyler Hamilton doesn't wear glasses so it can't be Tyler's nose piece.
Drake wears glasses.
Bring him in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Drake.
Yes, Horatio.
I'm gonna need your glasses.
For what?
Either you take them off or I'm gonna take them off you.
You decide.
Good decision.
Now sit down.
You did this.
In your attempt to wipe away the blood, Drake, you merely pushed it to the corner of your lens.
So slit the juggular.
Wet blood.
You had to be inches away.
I, um, I heard a scream.
And by the time I got down to the beach...
Mr. Hamilton.
Hamilton!
Mr. Hamilton?
Somebody help me!
No no.
Don't!
Wait, Wait!
Somebody!
HELP!
There's been a murder!
HELP!
I'm sorry, uncle.
Shut up.
Get out of those clothes.
Again, you have made this statement against my counsel.
Let is go, Coupler.
We're looking at life.
Are you aware of that.
Without parole.
What a waste.
What a waste.
You said ... our entire genetic makeup is in one cell.
How do we escape that?
Your family?
You stop procreating.
Thank you.
Taxi's downstairs.
I'll walk ya.
Jane.
Bad idea Paul.
Can I talk to you?
Please.
I'll meet you in the lobby.
I had no idea that Tyler was going to hurt her.
She has to know that.
I love her.
If you loved her, you wouldn't have traded her for a watch.
Mind if I join you?
Not at all.
Hamiltons are all over the TV too.
Deja vu.
The old case?
Fifteen years ago.
I wasn't on the job then.
July 25, 1987.
I found Drake Hamilton's car by the side of the road after a terrible accident.
Girl in the front seat, dead.
No Drake.
I went up to the Hamilton residence where I was received like a diplomat.
Glad handing promises, blah blah blah.
Drake will be right down.
Well, he did come down, four hours later.
With three attorneys in tow and a story about how Drake lent the girl the car.
So with no clothes at the scene, solid alibi and a mysterious chemical burn on his forearm,
we had nothing.
No charges were ever filed.
He walked.
No investigation.
At ME later told me... that the girl bled out and that all he had to do was call 911 from the road ... and she would've lived.
He didn't do that.
Horatio.
We got him.
We got him now.
If I had nailed him fifteen years ago...
Let's hope for the next one.
Let's do that.
Morning.
This would do wonders for tourism.
Yes.
Who called it in?
Jogger from the Lowles found the victims at 6:15.
Victims?
I'm only seeing one victim.
No, there was a girl down there.
A Jane Renshaw.
Age 24.
Here from Iowa.
She was beat the hell, unconscious and half drowned.
She's over at St. Luke's.
Well they made sure he was dead.
Did you get an I.D.?
No, and she was too out of it to help.
He was running away.
Why kill a guy who's running from the scene?
Yes, there in lies the rub my friend.
The evidence, as always, will speak for itself.
Why did you die so far from the girl, huh?
What's he telling you Alexx?
Sustained blunt force trauma to the head.
Multiple blows based on the blood.
Liver temperature is 87.2.
So he died around midnight.
Juggular.
Not a knife though.
Irregular object.
Bled out.
What's this mark on his cheek right there?
Burn mark.
Little bit of ash.
Something brown.
Smashing and slashing aren't enough.
Gotta burn him too huh.
If I'm gonna mess somebody up like this, I don't do it out in the open.
Unless you're not worried about it.
Male victim's hair is black.
Got blond here.
Just like the female vic.
So our guy and girl grab a blanket;
have a little fun in the moonlight.
Until they are rudely interrupted.
She's assaulted.
Tossed into the ocean left to die.
Guy tries to escape.
Half dead, scared out of his mind, he runs.
And someone catches up to him over here.
So that makes these the last footsteps of his life.
Megan Donner.
I'll be right there.
Sart nurse.
They've completed their exam.
We can talk to her now.
Keep me posted.
Got it.
Who wants to help me search around the girl?
We're working on the murder scene.
You ask for the girl?
I like a challenge.
Tide can come in at any moment.
Too much.
Hey check this out.
What have you got?
It's still sharp.
No erosion.
Damn good chance that could be from last night.
This is everything she had on.
Any indication of rape?
We recovered what looks like semen.
Tears on the lower part of her vagina.
Six, seven and eight o'clock.
Also a grade three concussion.
She give you a name?
She suffered a pretty severe trauma.
She doesn't remember the last twelve hours.
Oh listen.
She got antsy when I tried to administer an oral swab.
Sense memory.
She's repressing.
She's right there on the edge.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks Megan.
Hi Jane.
My name is Megan Donner.
I'm a crime scene investigator.
They said I was attacked.
We don't know by whom.
They won't tell me if my boyfriend Paul's okay.
Paul Vernet?
We don't know yet.
Right now, I'd like to concentrate on you.
We have evidence of a sexual assault.
If we're gonna find the person who did this to you...
I need your help.
The more evidence we collect from you, the better our chance of catching him.
Would you let me complete the exam?
Thanks.
Can you open?
That's good.
That's good.
Do you wear a retainer?
Would it be ok if I removed it?
I'm gonna, um, take this for now, ok?
Detective Fenwick will be here in a few minutes.
He needs to ask you some questions about Paul.
I'll be right outside.
What are you up to?
Sands from the hot area around the male victim.
Didn't you already sift around that area?
Yeah.
But there was a struggle, paramedics came through, sometimes things get buried.
So I dug a little deeper.
Oh my gosh.
Aren't you ambitious.
Yeah, look at this.
Nose piece from eyeglasses.
That's right.
Proof of blood.
Pink always was my favorite color.
I'll get this over to DNA.
I'll take it.
I'm going that way anyways.
You sure?
Great!
Something in the neck wound.
Looks like glass.
We found a lot of broken glass at the scene.
Approximately five meters from the body.
Is your glass green in color?
Copy that.
So that means somebody jabbed our guy with a broken bottle, doesn't it.
Interesting.
Because I'm thinking he was a bartender.
Based on?
Lime peel on his fingernails.
And these rashes.
Occupational dermatosis.
You can get it from squeezing a lot of lemons or limes in direct sunlight.
Female victim stated that her boyfriend was a CPA.
Maybe he moonlights.
Also said the boyfriend had light brown hair.
This guy's is black.
Check his eye color please.
Green.
CPA has brown.
You know what that means.
This ain't her boyfriend.
This ain't her boyfriend but it might be why he's on your table Alexx.
Thank you.
Detective Fenwick.
This is Horatio Caine.
Meet me at the female victim's hotel.
The Agramont.
That's right the Agramont.
I'm on my way.
Thank you Alexx.
Who are you guys?
Paul Varnette?
What's going on?
Well Paul, your girlfriend, Jane, is in the hospital.
The guy she was with last night is dead... and you look like you've been up all night, so why don't you tell me.
Got here as fast as I could.
Traffic on the causeway.
I can't believe someone did this to Jane.
When's the last time you saw her?

Guatamalan.
Temporary visa, no relatives.
Black hair, green eyes?
I'll tell you later.

The one that we found on the beach.
Paul Varnette.

49 bucks and water resistent down to 150 ft.
And now you are sporting that hunk of Switzerland.
Huh, 13 thou worth of gold.
Paul, I don't think you can afford a watch that expensive.
Do you?
Good morning everyone.
Brian Coupler.
I'm on retainer for the Hamiltons.
They asked me to represent you as a friend of the family.
Paul, if you buy into this, the Hamiltons will hang you out to dry in two seconds.
Like you aren't?
Paul you don't..
If you're innocent, explain it to us.
Stop goading him.
Paul, this man is not your attorney.
You did not hire him.
This is about you, this is your life.
It was kind of a gift.
From?
Just one kiss.
Just one kiss.
That's all he kept saying.
Who?
Tyler Hamilton.
Com'on.
Just one kiss.
Trade you my watch.
Com'on.
Just one kiss.
Trade you my watch.
She was upset.
Com'on.
It's no big thing.
It's friends.
I told her I was sorry.
I grabbed a bottle of champagne.
I said let's go.
She grabbed the bottle.
She walked off.
I lost track of her.
I figured she went down to the beach.
I stayed and I got drunk.
But you didn't follow her out to the beach.
No.
But I should've.
Look I screwed up.
Yes you did.
Yes you did.
Had you not traded her, none of this would've happened.
But that's the past.
Paul let's go.
I need to take a look at your watch.
If you want me to buy your story, I need to look at your watch.
What have you got?
Paul was telling the truth.
Found three sets of male DNA on this watch.
Ok.
Separate out Paul... and then cross-reference the unknowns with the sample from the retainer.
Let's do that.
You got it.
Drake.
Horatio.
I'm here for DNA sample.
Have you got a warrant?
This is your opportunity to clear your name.
I suggest you take it.
We have been through this Horatio.
Yes we have.
Back when I was a green CSI and driver's side airbags weren't standard issue.
Lucky for you though, huh.
Not so lucky for the young girl you had in your car.
I have never forgotten your help.
You know what I haven't forgotten?
That chemical burn on your arm on that airbag.
And your watch imprint.
I haven't forgotten those things either.
Well, you have some memory.
Seen this before?
Yeah, it's the watch I gave my nephew a few months ago.
Where did you find it?
There are skin cells embedded in the band.
Skin cells.
Did you know that our entire genetic code is stored in a single cell.
Now in this case, I have the DNA of two males.
One of which forced Jane Renshaw to have oral sex.
And the other one is a close relative.
Now.
Which one are you?
I was with her on the beach.
In a sexual way, you know?
Why didn't you mention this before?
Paul's my friend.
Besides, once I hit that mouse trap in her jaw, I was pretty much over.
That must have been disappointing huh.
Killed the mood.
I'll tell you that much.
I left her alone out there;
I went back to the guest house.
I went to bed.
You didn't see Estebban the bartender out there.
No.
Do you have your clothes from that night?
In the guest house.
I'm gonna need them.
Sure if my uncle says it's okay.
He's already admitted to a consensual act, Horatio.
Let it go.
A man was murdered out here.
Yes, but the girl is the one who will pay.
The press will eat her alive.
To protect her...
Are you suggesting that I protect a woman?
That's rich.
More Hamilton hardball?
I'm officially over them.
Can you forgive me for ever thinking that they were ever all that?
Well, I made the same mistake myself once.
What do we have?
Filed with the city.
Public access.
So is the beach.
And the property line ends here.
What's this right here?
Boardwalk dock.
That's also a public access.
We'll take that.
Wait a minute.
I've got blood drops right here.
More over there.
Pattern exclaimation points.
Spots point the direction of the path.
Yes they do.
And this being a public access.
Ours for the taking.
Blood you found belongs to Estebban Ordonez.
Of course we can't tell if it was from him or someone with his blood on 'im.
Ok but it doesn't matter because the murdered man's blood leads up to the Hamilton's house.
We got the warrant.
HEY!
HEY!
We're not even sure what we're looking for.
We never are.
But be happy for Tyler's clothes from that night.
Shirt, shoes, anything.
Unless of course he already burned them.
You know what that means.
Dig in.
That's one way to bury your past.
We've had plans to put in a tennis court for months.
Check our contract.
Oh we are.
Believe me.
Horatio, if I had known.
You knew.
I want a DNA sample from both of them.
Just because we can.
Okay?
Open wide.
Relax.
I won't jam it in too hard.
I'm gonna head back to the lab guys.
See you there.
Hey guys.
Hamilton men, try as they might, cannot hide their zippers.
Very carefully please.
Zipper's from a guy's medium size warm up jacket.
Manufactured by Fubu.
It's the same kind that Tyler was wearing at the, uh, night of the party according to the pictures from homicide.
You look for trace?
Isolated fragments of glass in the zipper teeth.
Glass melts at 2700 degree Fahrenheight.
Yes but wood fire only gets up to one thousand and the Hamiltons' couldn't have known that.
Density matches the murder weapon.
Tyler clobbers the guy.
And glass rains down on his jacket.
It's weird how one kiss can turn into just a mess.
Cigar you asked me to process from the guest house.
Same tobacco as the burn on Estebban's face.
Saliva.
Tyler's.
And the material on the end, silica.
Aka beach sand.
Let's go talk to the young Mr. Hamilton.
Nice going.
So Tyler.
You pony up the 13 thousand dollar watch for just one kiss.
And the young lady runs off with the bartender anyway.
Bet that kiss is gonna cost you a lot more than your watch.
So what.
The bartender changes into his street clothes, and the girl walked off with him?
You just went out there to razz the guy for stealing your girl.
But once you saw that lowly bartender kissing the girl that blew you off, the old Hamilton arrogance turned into rage.
And you have what you claim to be consensual sex.
And then you leave the young woman alone to die in the water.
If you say so.
But that wasn't enough.
You go the extra yard and you burn the man's face.
He ran.
You caught up and you cut his throat with what was left of that champagne bottle.
You're way off.
Then why don't you educate us.
Excuse me.
I know this is gonna be good.
What's going on.
Tyler Hamilton doesn't wear glasses.
Excuse me?
The nose piece from the glasses at the crime scene.
DNA tripled checked it and found blood from our dead guy on it.
Transfer spatter.
Direct spatter, medium force.
The only way you get spatter from a nose piece is to be there when the murder's happening.
I know but Tyler Hamilton doesn't wear glasses so it can't be Tyler's nose piece.
Drake wears glasses.
Bring him in.
Ok.
Thank you.
Drake.
Yes, Horatio.
I'm gonna need your glasses.
For what?
Either you take them off or I'm gonna take them off you.
You decide.
Good decision.
Now sit down.
You did this.
In your attempt to wipe away the blood, Drake, you merely pushed it to the corner of your lens.
So slit the juggular.
Wet blood.
You had to be inches away.
I, um, I heard a scream.
And by the time I got down to the beach...
Mr. Hamilton.
Hamilton!
Mr. Hamilton?
Somebody help me!
No no.
Don't!
Wait, Wait!
Somebody!
HELP!
There's been a murder!
HELP!
I'm sorry, uncle.
Shut up.
Get out of those clothes.
Again, you have made this statement against my counsel.
Let is go, Coupler.
We're looking at life.
Are you aware of that.
Without parole.
What a waste.
What a waste.
You said ... our entire genetic makeup is in one cell.
How do we escape that?
Your family?
You stop procreating.
Thank you.
Taxi's downstairs.
I'll walk ya.
Jane.
Bad idea Paul.
Can I talk to you?
Please.
I'll meet you in the lobby.
I had no idea that Tyler was going to hurt her.
She has to know that.
I love her.
If you loved her, you wouldn't have traded her for a watch.
Mind if I join you?
Not at all.
Hamiltons are all over the TV too.
Deja vu.
The old case?
Fifteen years ago.
I wasn't on the job then.
July 25, 1987.
I found Drake Hamilton's car by the side of the road after a terrible accident.
Girl in the front seat, dead.
No Drake.
I went up to the Hamilton residence where I was received like a diplomat.
Glad handing promises, blah blah blah.
Drake will be right down.
Well, he did come down, four hours later.
With three attorneys in tow and a story about how Drake lent the girl the car.
So with no clothes at the scene, solid alibi and a mysterious chemical burn on his forearm,
we had nothing.
No charges were ever filed.
He walked.
No investigation.
At ME later told me... that the girl bled out and that all he had to do was call 911 from the road ... and she would've lived.
He didn't do that.
Horatio.
We got him.
We got him now.
If I had nailed him fifteen years ago...
Let's hope for the next one.
Let's do that.
English
- Where'd you score that?
- Mike the groundskeeper.
Guys, take a beer.
On the house.
- You want one, too?
- He got that for you?
Paid $15 for it.
Mike sounds pretty cool.
You want one?
- Come on, Ray.
Don't be a jerk.
- No.
Come on.
Here, Andy, have one.
All right.
Mr. Spaulding.
All right, hand it over.
The beer.
Give it to me.
And the cigarettes.
All right now, go back to the dorms and wait for me.
Andy, come here.
I'd like to have a word with you.
Andy Deaver, a 17-year-old junior at Spaulding Academy boarding school.
He told some other students he was leaving for good that night.
We're not sure why.
Headmaster Graham Spaulding was the last one to see him.
Andy never made it home.
Spaulding says Andy left campus at around 6:30 p.m.
About 10 minutes after the other kids got back to their dorms.
When did the call come in from his parents?
Midnight.
He was driving the family car.
The same one we found on Route 34 a couple of miles from here.
It had a flat tire.
One of my guys called it in at 2:45 a.m.
Doors unlocked, keys in the ignition, tire jack on the ground.
- You run it through forensics?
- Not exactly yet.
What do you mean, "not exactly yet"?
We're trying to keep kids from drinking in the woods.
We had the car ticketed and towed to impound.
- Your canine unit get any hits?
- They sniffed the woods... but they kept coming back to where the car was.
Okay.
We're going to take it from here, okay?
I told Andy that he really impressed me in his two years here.
- I didn't understand why he was leaving.
- You didn't call his parents?
I thought it was temporary.
With some kids, you have to give them just a little bit of rope.
So what happened after you spoke?
He headed off to his car and home, I guess.
Forgive me for saying this, but you don't seem particularly concerned.
In my position, I have to maintain a certain amount of calm.
The truth is all of these kids are extremely bright... and frankly, many of them would have difficulty at another school.
We have kids who take off and come back in a week or so... with some excuse from their parents.
Right.
So you run a pretty lenient ship?
I never saw being strict work with any kid.
All right.
We'll have to do a more extensive search... of the campus and surrounding woods, if it's okay.
Absolutely.
Anything at all.
As a matter of fact....
- What's that?
- A reward.
$15,000 for help, information, whatever.
I didn't know who to make it out to.
FBI, Department of Justice.
That's very generous.
I'll make sure you get a receipt.
I should get back.
With all this going on and 300 adolescents, you can imagine the anxiety.
Of course.
Listen, I am going to need to speak to you again.
- Naturally.
- Terrific.
Until then.
Don't take your eyes off that guy.
Graham Spaulding:
46, divorced, no children.
Lived in Phoenix from '90 to '96.
Atlanta, '96 till last year.
He is a retired veterinarian.
Sold his practice.
Moved down here to take over the school last year, after his father died.
With what qualifications?
Looking after animals?
- High school's pretty rough these days.
- Hilarious.
Graham's chief qualification seems to be that his father was Alfred Spaulding... who founded the school in 1956.
- Girlfriend?
- No, lives alone.
- Any priors?
- Record's clean.
What about his alibi?
Says he was reviewing mid-semester evaluations at home.
Got forensics back on the car.
Multiple prints, including those of Mr. Graham Spaulding.
The tire wound is inconsistent with a moving blowout.
It's a sidewall puncture, probably a screwdriver.
How far away from the campus was the car?
3.5 miles.
So somebody drove that car to the roadside and made it look like a flat.
- And they left the car jack there, too.
- Nice touch.
Okay, we have to play this very carefully.
If Spaulding has the kid, he may try and get back to him.
We need a 24-hour surveillance--
- If he smells us, he won't make a move.
- That's the dance.
We have to focus on him without him realizing he's the prime suspect.
Best case, the kid can survive 72 hours without water.
That leaves us 50 hours.
Viv, set up meetings with the other faculty members... to make it look like Spaulding's not the only one.
Martin and Samantha, I want you to talk to all the students you can.
Get as much information about Spaulding and his relationship with Andy.
Got it.
SOG surveillance is in place on Spaulding.
It seems as though he left in a hurry.
He must have.
But for the life of me, I can't imagine why.
He loved it here.
Can you tell me about the phone call last night?
He sounded so distressed.
Mom, I just don't want to be here anymore.
- But I thought everything was going great.
- Well, it's not.
Andy, does this have something to do with that girl?
I don't want to talk about it.
I want to come home.
I want to speak to Mr. Spaulding about this first.
No, Mom.
Please, this has nothing to do with him.
Don't worry, okay?
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
- But you didn't call Mr. Spaulding?
- No.
I thought we'd talk about it when he got home.
What was Andy's relationship like with Mr. Spaulding?
Pretty close, I think.
His father left us when he was six... and he has a tendency to get attached to the men in his life.
Okay.
And you spoke about a girl.
Was there someone in particular?
I don't know.
He came home last weekend, and he spent the whole time....
What do you call it?
Burning a CD for her.
But, of course, he wouldn't tell me who she was.
So, you and Andy worked in the office together?
- Yeah, it's supposed to be an honor.
- An honor?
Mr. Spaulding picks certain kids he says deserve it.
- So that's how I know Andy.
- What's Andy like?
I don't know.
Pretty shy.
Keeps to himself.
How was he yesterday?
Same as always.
Did his work, didn't say much.
Any idea why he would have wanted to leave school?
He's not too popular here.
I figured maybe that was it.
- Does he have a girlfriend?
- No.
Andy?
Come on, he must have liked someone.
Phoebe Burnell, but everybody likes her.
Andy didn't stand a chance.
That's a cool tattoo.
- Yeah, that was stupid.
- Why is that?
- Because I can never take it off.
- How's it going in here?
- Fine.
- Is he being helpful?
Very.
Technically, he needs to be with a parent or guardian when he's questioned... but I realize that time is of the essence here.
Please, continue.
Actually, we're pretty much done here.
Thank you.
I can't believe all this.
- I just saw him yesterday.
- How well do you know Andy?
We have a couple of classes together.
- Have you two ever dated?
- No.
- Think he might have a crush on you?
- I don't know.
- What about the CD he made for you?
- What?
- What, he didn't give it to you?
- No.
Oh, my God, that's what that was about.
Yesterday, we were right over there when Andy walked up to me.
Hey, Phoebe.
Hi.
What's up?
Did you need the notes from Chem?
I know you missed class Tuesday.
That's sweet.
I got them from Hannah.
I have something for you.
Andy, aren't you supposed to be covering the phones?
Yeah, I was just about to.
It'd be great if you could get there.
We're swamped.
- Phoebe, come on.
- In just a sec.
I should go.
I'm going to be late for class.
Thanks.
If that's the last time I ever see him, and he was trying to--
Wasn't he at the grove later?
Yeah, I almost forgot.
And it was weird because Mr. Spaulding showed up there, too.
- What's this?
- It's the blueprints of Spaulding's house.
Take a look at this.
Six weeks ago, Spaulding put in for a permit... to build an 8' by 10' room in his basement.
- Twelve electrical outlets, plumbing....
- Extra bathroom?
No, the house already has three.
Plus, this permit doesn't cover a toilet.
And this room has no windows or doors leading to the outside.
- A holding cell?
- Or worse.
You think we have enough for a warrant?
- Let's find out.
- All right.
Spaulding's house is half a mile away from the school.
Andy was never seen entering or leaving the house.
- But with the circumstantial evidence--
- Still don't have probable cause.
This kid could be in a torture chamber in Spaulding's basement.
- You think he's guilty.
What are we doing?
- Danny, come in.
- Go ahead.
- Where is he?
He's going into the administration building.
Okay, I want you and Martin to head over to his house.
Inspect the grounds.
See what's visible through the windows.
- I'll stay on Spaulding.
- Sounds good.
- What's up?
- I think I heard something inside.
Listen.
You think you heard, or you did hear?
Got any new leads?
Actually, it's too early to tell if any of the leads are real.
Your father looks like he was an imposing man.
One could interpret it that way, I suppose.
- You went to school here?
- Class of '74.
Must have been difficult having your father be the headmaster.
My father was a strong and supportive man.
Many of these kids can't say that.
No, I meant you must've got a rough time from the other students.
- I was pretty popular, actually.
- Really?
And what about you, Agent Malone?
Moved around a lot.
My father was in the Army.
By all accounts, I was pretty miserable.
That's a shame.
It is.
But it made me think of the conversation we had earlier about Andy... and how fortunate your students are... that they have someone that has their best interests at heart.
Thank you.
I must be getting back to my house.
I need to make some phone calls.
- Sure.
- Worried parents, you understand.
- Yes, of course.
- I trust you can find your own way out.
Sure.
Absolutely.
Danny, come in.
Yeah, go ahead.
Spaulding's on his way back.
Get out of there.
- Danny's in the house.
- What the hell are you guys doing?
He thought he heard something.
He's on his way back.
You got to get out of there.
Danny, do you read me?
Hey, boy.
That's a good boy.
Danny, Spaulding just pulled up.
Get out of there.
He's on his way into the house, man.
Come on, what the hell are you doing in there?
He's entering the house, pal.
He's in the house.
I repeat, suspect is in the house.
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah, I heard you.
- I hope you got something good?
- Oh, yeah.
They all remind me of Andy.
All gangly, self-conscious, and insecure.
Easy prey.
You should see the ones I left inside.
Those are disturbing.
They're voyeuristic, like they were taken with a telephoto lens.
Look at this one.
It's posed and nude.
We've got to find out who these two boys are.
I'll run them against any missing kids in Atlanta or Phoenix.
Do you have anything on the warrant?
'Cause if these photos don't clear, we're in big trouble.
Jack, we're okay.
Who's your judge?
Randall?
No, he's out of town.
It's Adderly.
I want everything to be done by the book from now on.
Okay, we got him on possession of child pornography.
More, if we prove he took the pictures.
I don't want him walking with a smut conviction and a slap on the wrist.
If he gets lawyered up, he will stop talking.
And time is running out for Andy.
So bring him in, break him with the photos.
We don't know we have these photos until the warrant clears.
I need to get inside Spaulding's head before I meet him again.
How are we with the ex-wife?
Found her in New Jersey.
I'm headed out there.
Jack, Van Doren wants to see you.
Have a seat, Jack.
I just read your report... on Agent Taylor searching the Spaulding residence.
There appears to be some ambiguity regarding the photo album.
What kind of ambiguity?
The ambiguous kind.
Agent Taylor thought he heard the kid inside.
He entered the premises under exigent circumstances.
- The album was in plain view.
- Please save all of that for the judge.
Just don't base any of your questioning on those photos.
Without a warrant, it's all fruit from the poisonous tree.
Do you understand?
I didn't go to law school, Paula, but I think I grasp the concept.
Graham and I met on a flight from New York to Phoenix.
We both lived there.
He was one of the most charming men I'd ever met.
- We were married within eight months.
- But divorced two years later.
After the first six months, he lost interest in me.
In every way.
And you filed for divorce.
I was getting there, but he beat me to it.
One day, there was a message on the machine.
The next week, I got a letter from an attorney in Atlanta.
He'd moved there.
Do you remember either of these two boys?
No.
That's Robby Griffith.
He interned for Graham at the vet clinic for a while.
It didn't work out.
- What went wrong?
- I don't know.
I do know that Robby was a pretty troubled kid.
Take a look at this.
A 1999 case file on Eric Lipinski.
Fifteen years old, from DeKalb County, Georgia.
Reported missing.
Found murdered four days later.
The same kid.
And Spaulding was the last to see Eric on the D.O.D.
Atlanta police interviewed him four times and had to let him walk.
- They couldn't link him to the murder.
- That's the third kid.
Vivian just called.
This one, Robby Griffith... missing from the Phoenix division since '96.
Never found.
So this Spaulding guy knows what he's doing.
The sick bastard thinks he'll get away with it.
Go back to the school and set up the arrest.
- I'll fax the warrant to Westchester.
- Great.
According to your affidavit, Agent Taylor... you heard what you call "suspicious noises" from Mr. Spaulding's house?
Yes, Your Honor.
I heard a high-pitched whining noise.
I heard another sound that I took to be chains of some sort.
Of some sort?
Your Honor, Agent Taylor's exigent entry into the house... was based on a totality of circumstances surrounding the boy's disappearance.
The evasive nature of the suspect--
All right.
Let's move to the photos.
While I was in the house, I entered a darkroom.
It was there that I saw hundreds of other pictures of teenage boys.
- But none of the missing boy?
- No, sir.
At which time you also saw the source of your suspicious chain-rattling...
- to be a large German shepherd?
- That's correct.
So, I assume you were preparing to leave the premises... but then you saw the photo album.
Yes, I was.
Your Honor, that photo album was in plain view.
Your Honor, if I may cut to the chase.
The album contains photos of the missing boy.
It also contains a nude photo of a minor... that was the victim of an unsolved murder in Atlanta.
There's a third photo of another minor that went missing from the Phoenix area.
And you believe the suspect Spaulding to be responsible... for the murder and disappearance of the two boys based on these photos?
Yes.
In conjunction with other evidence.
We believe that if we can charge him with Lipinski's murder... we can get a confession about Andy, and perhaps find the boy alive.
- Based on these photos?
- They tie the cases together.
He's got to know we're watching him.
Where the hell is that warrant?
Damn it.
Gentlemen, I got to tell you... this guy Spaulding sounds like real scum.
I hope you can put him away for the rest of his miserable life.
And I'll be glad to help you do that... as soon as you appear before me with constitutionally obtained evidence.
Now, just so you understand, Agents Taylor and Malone... you may not enter a house without a search warrant... under the flimsiest of exigent circumstances... and then bootstrap that questionable entry... into a fishing expedition for other evidence.
Son, you had no right to continue the search after finding that dog.
You had no right to open the photo album.
You certainly had no right to remove it from the premises.
And you have absolutely no right to an arrest warrant... based on the photographs found therein.
Make sense?
Yes, sir.
You're kidding.
Okay.
The warrant was denied.
We got to let him walk.
They found Lipinski's body in a mineshaft tunnel... about 50 miles from his home.
According to the autopsy report... he had been strangled and revived repeatedly over the course of three days... ending with a lethal injection of Xylazine.
Animal tranquilizer.
- That's the same as Patrick McCullough.
- What do you mean?
The kid that works in the school office with Andy.
He's got the same tattoo.
- Is he Spaulding's type?
- Yeah.
Lanky, shy, awkward.
- I'm gonna go talk--
- Wait.
I want Martin to go.
If there was something going on between them... he's more likely to admit it to a male agent.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
I'll have Westchester put out search parties... in the quarries and mineshafts.
Within a 100-mile radius, please.
Look, Jack, I know I screwed up.
And I know it's gonna cost us, and I'm prepared to--
You know what, Danny?
- It happened.
Move on.
- Okay.
So, what's my assignment?
Mrs. Deaver?
I just keep thinking... when I brought him here that first day...
I thought I had done the right thing.
He was nervous.
He didn't know anybody.
I told him he could come home whenever he wanted.
He called me every day for that first week... till he settled in.
I really thought... this was the right place for him.
- It's quiet out here.
- Yes, it is.
So, how's the investigation going?
Pretty good.
We're still eliminating suspects.
So, how long has it been?
- Since when?
- Since the disappearance.
Since you last saw him, you mean?
- Yes.
- About 40 hours.
So I guess he didn't just go for a walk in the woods.
I think not.
- I came here to give this back to you.
- That's not mine.
- It's not?
- No.
We found it in your house.
Any suggestions as to how it might have gotten there?
You came into my house without a warrant?
Yes, that's why I'm giving this back to you.
That article was seized illegally.
Do you want it or not?
I told you, it's not mine.
Okay.
Aren't you even a little bit curious as to what's in this?
Patrick, we're not screwing around here.
Andy's life is at stake, and we are running out of time.
I don't know what you want from me.
We think you know more than you're telling us.
Like what?
We think that Mr. Spaulding and Andy were having a sexual relationship.
I don't know about that.
This is serious.
I don't know what they did, okay?
All I know is I saw them the day Andy went missing.
That's for you.
$50?
- It's just a little thank you.
- For what?
For all the extra effort that you've been putting in around here.
And for being you.
Thanks.
I'm having a barbecue at my house tonight for the Math Club.
Why don't you come by?
- I have a paper I have to finish.
- Just for a little bit.
Well, I'll see.
Now, don't get all mopey.
Let me see that smile.
The barbecue was a lie.
If Andy showed up, Mr. Spaulding would say it was canceled... and they'd be alone.
How do you know that?
I just do, okay?
Patrick, did Mr. Spaulding do that to you?
Look, if he took advantage of you... he's the one to blame, not you.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
We'd go out for long drives in his truck.
He'd tell me how I needed to believe in myself.
That I was special.
Did he make you get the tattoo?
He said it would always remind me of how strong I really was... and of our times together.
It sounds stupid now.
And after I got it, he went really crazy.
What do you mean?
He kept saying things like I owed him because he helped me so much... and that the "S" was really for Spaulding.
Is that when you started to pull away?
A couple of weeks ago.
I guess that's when he started up with Andy.
Right.
All right.
This is not gonna be easy... but we're gonna need you to press charges.
Spaulding, we have a warrant for your arrest.
Put your hands where we can see them.
- What are the charges?
- Three counts of child rape... two counts of child endangerment... and six counts of committing a lewd act with a minor.
- Who's making these charges?
- Patrick McCullough.
Take him out to the car and read him his rights.
Bring in the ERT.
Let's get started.
We don't have much time.
Xylazine.
Soil samples on Spaulding's truck... match the samples on the boots that Danny found.
We've got a 150-foot climbing rope, also covered in soil.
- Lime and clay deposits?
- A cave.
There's a national park about 60 miles north of the Academy.
- Coleman Caves.
- Right, I've been up there.
The place has hundreds of miles of passageways.
This time of year, temperatures drop below freezing.
Washington wants me to supervise this case directly.
We're in the headlines now, Jack.
From this stage, we have to follow procedure flawlessly.
- What stage?
- We need a clean conviction on this one.
- This kid is still alive.
- Come on, Jack.
The kid is gone.
I think the kid is still alive.
The son of a bitch knows where he is.
I can get it out of him.
I'm having him processed and transferred here to Manhattan Detention.
You're off the case.
- Paula, come on.
- It's done, Jack.
At least let me handle the transfer.
Martin, take a left up here.
That's not the way to the thruway.
- I know that you took Andy.
- "Took Andy"?
Please.
We found the rope.
We found the boots.
We know that you took him to the Coleman Caves.
If you know so much, what do you need me for?
- Actually, you need me.
- How is that?
Because I can help you.
My boss gets a hold of you, the press... they're gonna turn you into a monster.
I'll take the chance.
Tell me where Andy is and I will help you.
I told you, I have no idea where Andy is.
Your prints are all over his car.
Look, this is all circumstantial crap!
If you had the evidence to arrest me for Andy's disappearance, you would have.
And we wouldn't be driving around in the rain now, would we?
Van Doren called.
Jack still hasn't made it to Manhattan Detention.
- What'd you say?
- I said I'd look into it.
I meant what I said before, Graham.
I know how much you care about these kids.
That's why you took Andy under your wing.
He was confused, vulnerable.
You were the only one who understood him.
- Is that right?
- I think so.
But then he turned on you, didn't he?
I know how that feels.
I know how painful that can be.
You pour yourself into someone... your time, energy, and devotion.
You give them everything they need to grow, and then they just abandon you.
- Are you speaking from experience?
- Sure.
You love someone... you make love to someone... you give your life to them.
And then they don't even look at you.
Any word from Malone?
No, ma'am.
Westchester was late processing Spaulding out.
The warden told me himself... that Spaulding was released 20 minutes ahead of schedule.
- I hadn't heard that.
- The guy's already asked for a lawyer.
If Jack interrogates him... if he even mentions Andy Deaver in a custodial setting...
Spaulding will walk.
I'm sure Jack knows the law.
Get back to me in five minutes with Malone's exact location.
Yes, ma'am.
I know about the other boy.
What other boy?
This kid.
The young, scrawny, frightened, lonely kid.
The kid who only wanted love and approval.
I know his pain.
I know that boy.
Yes, I do.
And I know that you want to put that boy out of his misery.
You know, Graham, your father wasn't a strong man.
He wasn't a supportive man.
He was a weak, cowardly, sadistic bastard.
I know he used to touch you, and I know you used to beg him to stop.
You believe whatever you want.
You don't know anything about my father.
You know, I've been giving something a lot of thought.
It's occurred to me that... in some ways I envy you.
- You envy me?
- Yes.
The power... that you have with those boys, what that must feel like.
- What boys?
- Andy.
Eric Lipinski, Robby Griffith.
I know there have been others.
There have been many.
Do me a favor, Graham.
Tell me what it's like, the moment that you take them out.
Tell me.
You can see the terror in their eyes, right?
You can feel their hearts racing.
You can feel the cold sweat under your hands... just before you stick the needle in.
It must be such a rush.
Martin, put the CD in.
Andy made this CD for Phoebe.
He wanted her to think about him when he wasn't there.
Is that what you wanted?
Is that why you stole it?
You wanted to think about him?
Is it what you two listened to when you were together?
- No.
- No, that's right.
That's right, you never got a chance.
You never got a chance to go back to him... because he's still out there.
He's waiting.
It must be hard.
It must be hard, knowing that he's out there.
Waiting.
The touch of his skin.
The feel of him under you.
I understand you, Graham, I do.
I've been to that school.
I've seen those beautiful boys.
Their beautiful bodies.
To hold all that innocence in your arms.
To take... the power.
It must be really frustrating... knowing that Andy is out there waiting for you.
Waiting.
And you can't get back to him.
You can't be with him one last time.
But I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you 15 minutes with him, if you tell me where he is.
You'd do that?
I'll give you 15 minutes with him alone.
You can do whatever you want.
Fifteen minutes.
Whatever you want.
He's in bad shape, but he's gonna make it.
Agent Malone?
Do I get my 15 minutes now?
Your 15 minutes are over.

- Previously:
- We screwed it up.
She's just disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
That the kinda demon you are?
I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
So, you three have, what?
Banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch Nemesises.
- Dawn, you need to eat.
- Thanks for your concern.
Why is she taking it out on you?
- (Tara) This isn't gonna work.
- (Willow) Are you gonna leave me?
- (Buffy) Willow has a problem.
- No more spells. I'm finished.
- l'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Afraid I'm gonna...?
- Things have changed.
- l'm disgusted with myself.
(Buffy sighs)
(clattering)
(Buffy groans)
(smashing)
We missed the bed again.
Lucky for the bed.
is this a new rug?
No.
Just looks different when you're under it.
You know, this place is OK for a hole in the ground.
You fixed it up.
Well, I ate a decorator once.
Maybe something stuck.
- l've been thinking of changing my room.
- Yeah?
Yeah. I think the New Kids on the Block posters are starting to date me.
Well, if you want, I can...
Are we having a conversation?
What?
No!
No.
- Maybe.
- Huh.
What?
Isn't this usually the part where you kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
That's the plan.
Soon as my legs start working.
You were amazing.
You got the job done yourself.
I was just trying to keep up.
The things you do.
The way you make it hurt in all the wrong places. I've never been with such an animal.
I'm not an animal.
You wanna see the bite marks?
You know, it's late. I should get home before Dawn goes to sleep.
- And she's off.
- Have you seen my underwear?
What is this to you, this thing we have?
What?
We don't have a... thing.
We have... this.
That's all.
Do you even like me?
Sometimes.
But you like what I do to you.
(jangling)
Do you trust me?
Never.
How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
Actually living with supervillains was not in the deal.
We're on the lam.
It's not like we have a choice.
This sucks.
Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
Stop whining!
Get your sissy crap out of the way!
Hey, quit it!
Don't you curse me.
Hey, give me my bone!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
(Warren) Hey!
When you girls are done, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.
Cool.
Got the thing?
- Musk gland of a Hombja'moleev demon.
- (all groan)
Fresh.
All right.
Stand back.
Doma voluntatem.
Libere cupidinem.
Arumpe ignem.
Excita.
OK.
Ow.
Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener is on line.
Now, with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave.
I know just where to start.
- Doublemeat is double sweet.
Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- Just something I'm tryin'.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, time has no meaning here.
Gina, I'm takin' a break.
I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
If you close your eyes and smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away.
Eventually.
I'm hoping.
Thanks for coming by.
is it bad?
I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
I knew this was gonna happen.
What did Willow do now?
Did she... hurt anyone?
What?
No, no.
Um...
Tara, this isn't about Willow.
I thought that's why you didn't want to meet at the house.
Sorry. lt's...
Willow's fine.
She's been doing really well.
You'd be proud of her.
Good.
That's good.
So what do you want to talk about?
It's Spike.
He can hurt me... without his head exploding.
Oh, my God.
His chip stopped working?
No. lt still works.
Just not on me.
I need to know about the spell, the one that brought me back.
I...
I'd ask Willow, but...
You think it's you.
I don't know.
I feel... different.
There are things that... I think... maybe...
I came back wrong.
No, Buffy.
That's not...
No.
You didn't.
Can you check out the spell?
Just see if there's something that...
Could you just check?
Please?
Right there!
That's got it.
Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
Mad Dog Three to Mad Dog One.
- Signal's strong and clear.
Over.
- Roger that.
Beginning preliminary sweep.
Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer.
I don't want any surprises.
We can really have anyone we want.
- lt's like candy.
- Juicy, pulsating candy.
Oh!
The one with the neck.
Put the whammy on the neck!
(Andrew) No. I want the redhead!
(Jonathan) The redhead's too tall.
- Get off of me!
Jerk!
- Take it back!
- Target acquired.
- What?
lnitiating contact.
- The brunette?
- Oh, she's kinda cute.
Ow!
- Oh, no.
Go for the leather skirt!
- Bazoombas!
- Yeah.
Go for the one with the bazoombas.
- Bazoombas.
(both) Bazoombas.
- (feedback) - (both scream)
So how did you get so beautiful?
OK.
Does that line usually wor...?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- lt's nice to see you, too, Katrina.
It's the seeing you that's throwing me.
I thought I was pretty clear I never wanted that to happen again.
- Never's a long time, baby.
- Apparently, not long enough.
You're not still sore about that thing, are you?
What thing would that be, exactly?
The wind-up slut you tinkered together?
Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
OK.
So I've made a few mistakes.
No.
No, I did.
For ever lowering myself to be with ajerk like you.
- No.
Don't say that.
- Well, what did you expect?
To just waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?
No. I just thought we could talk.
I thought maybe we could work things out.
There is nothing to work out.
What you did was sick.
Just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.
God!
Yes, I'm sure.
I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
I'm home!
Who wants to help scrape the grease off my...
- ls there singing?
Are we singing again?
- No.
Just the dancin'.
We're teaching Dawn synchronised dance steps for the wedding reception.
Wanna go for a spin?
I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse.
- Oh.
Rough day?
- Kinda.
You've been goin' at it too hard.
We hardly ever see you.
What with slinging' the Doublemeat and pounding' the big evil.
You are looking a little pounded.
Just around the eyes.
Hey, we're thinking of heading to the Bronze later.
Wanna come?
Get all unwindy?
Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me.
Nectar of the working man.
- No. I'll stay here with Dawn.
- (car horn)
Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and... listen to the cars honk?
- Where are you going?
- l'm sleeping over at Janice's.
I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
It's OK. I checked it out.
Janice's mom is picking her up.
Oh.
I didn't think you'd care.
You're never home, so... I know. I'm sorry.
But I'm here now, all visible and everything.
- Can't you stay at Janice's another night?
- Her mom's cooking Mexican.
She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas.
- Not like I knew you'd be around.
- (car horn)
Frosty nectar.
Now, please?
(cork pops)
- Thank you, baby.
- My pleasure, Master.
That is so cool.
I could've used one of these in high school.
Gentlemen.
To crime.
(all) Crime.
(wheezes)
- Crime tastes funny.
- Wow.
I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but...
Wow!
Yeah, she's... really cute.
Cute?
Look at her, men.
The shape of her lips.
The smooth, silky skin.
The way her nose crinkles when she laughs.
She's perfect.
(Jonathan and Andrew giggle)
- Yeah.
- She's totally hot.
So are you, Master.
- You think so?
- Oh yes, Master.
OK.
So... how do we...?
- You know?
- Who gets to...?
- l do.
- That's not fair.
- Dude, you didn't call it.
- l don't have to call it.
She's mine.
But don't worry.
You can play with her all you want.
After I'm done with her.
(wheezes)
I missed you so much.
You never should have left me.
- Say it.
- l never should have left you, Master.
- Now tell me you love me.
- l love you, Master.
- Again.
- l love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
Get on your knees.
Yes, Warren.
Wait.
What'd you just say?
I said "Yes, Warr..."
What the...?
What did you do to me?
!
- Get the dampener!
- Who the hell are you?
- Um, your masters.
- My what?
!
- Where'd you put it?
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Get the dampener!
- You were sharing me with these dorks?
!
Hey!
We're supervillains!
- Call us "master".
- Wait!
- Oh, crap.
- lt's out ofjuice.
is that what you used on me?
Oh, my God!
First the skankbot and now this?
- What is wrong with you?
!
- l wanted us to be together.
There is no us!
Get that through your meaty head. I am not your girlfriend any more!
- She's your ex?
- Dude, that is messed up.
Oh, you think?
You bunch of little boys playing at being men?
Well, this is not some fantasy.
It's not a game, you freaks!
It's rape!
- What?
- No, we didn't...
You're all sick.
And I'm gonna make sure you get locked up for this.
- Then we'll see how you like getting raped!
- Stop her!
Get off me!
Charge the cerebral dampener.
- Warren...
- Charge the dampener.
Andrew, get her up.
We'll give her another dose.
A stronger one.
Everything's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I don't think so.
She's dead.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Her neck, itjust...
No, that's... not...
- This isn't happening.
- l just...
I gotta... I gotta...
Let me think.
What'd you do?
What the hell did you do?
!
We did this, me and Andrew and you.
It's on all of us.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Shut up!
We have to get...
We have to get rid of it.
How?
Maybe a spell.
Can you teleport it outta here?
No.
She's... lt's too big.
Andrew?
- Andrew?
- What?
is there anything that you can summon, something that...
something that can devour that much?
Maybe a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater, but they're hard to control.
It'd go for us, too.
Well, that's it, man.
We're screwed.
- Stay calm.
- Tell that to your girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend!
- lt doesn't matter.
There's a link.
You knew her, so there's a link.
You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together?
She'll figure it out!
It was an accident.
Maybe we could turn ourselves in.
- No.
- lf we go to the police now...
- No. I'm not going to jail.
- We can't hide this!
Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead!
Well, then maybe it should be sooner.
- Are you insane?
- Listen.
- No!
- Listen!
We have two problems:
the body and the Slayer.
Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both, with one big stone?
(Willow) What are they doing?
(d "Boo Wah Boo Wah" by Red and the Red Hots)
We're not gonna have to do that at the wedding?
Cos there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
You're still doing OK, right?
Yeah.
You know, some days are harder than the really hard days.
It's easier like this, though, when I'm not alone.
- l'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
- No, that's not... lt's OK.
We know you've been all tied up.
- What?
- With yourjob and the slaying.
I see sitting where there should be dancing.
- Come share in the joy of our groove thing.
- And despite that, I succumb to the beat.
- l think I'll catch the next soul train out.
- You sure?
Oh, yeah.
You know, glass all the way empty.
More nectar required.
Cool.
Well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricating'.
You see?
You try to be with them.
But you'll always end up in the dark.
With me.
What would they think of you if they found out... all the things you've done?
If they knew... who you really were?
Don't.
Stop me.
No, don't close your eyes.
Look at them.
That's not your world.
You belong in the shadows.
With me.
Look at your friends, and tell me you don't love getting away with this... right under their noses.
Oh!
I think I pulled ajive muscle last night.
The funky monkey claims another victim.
Tara.
What are you doing here?
I mean...
Uh, it's OK for you to be here if you have things that you have to be here for.
Yeah. I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
- There's a monkey problem?
- Only if you don't stretch first.
The Brekenkrieg Grimoire?
Light reading?
Yeah. I was just...
No, it's OK. I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because...
You don't have to hide it. I'm not... I'm doing better.
No spells for 32 days.
I can even go to the magic shop now, as long as someone's with me at all times.
But, uh...
But it's better now. lt really is.
You know, if you were checking on me?
No, I wouldn't...
- l was just looking for Buffy.
- Oh.
Well, I haven't seen her since last night.
She's not around much these days.
We kinda miss her.
I'm sure she feels the same way.
If you see her, can you tell her that I need to talk to her?
It's important.
- Yeah.
Of course I will.
- Thanks.
Will?
I'm...
I'm glad you're doing better.
(d "Out of This World" by Bush)
Don't think about the evil, bloodsucking fiend.
Focus on anything but the evil fiend.
(woman screams)
Thank you.
Huh?
It's OK. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you walk?
Are you hurt?
(whispering)
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
Ow!
Bloody hell!
What'd you do that for?
Spike?
Buffy!
Spike.
What's happening?
So you thought you could just slip away, then?
Vampire, remember?
I could feel you.
Ow!
Bloody hell!
What'd you do that for?
(Spike) Buffy!
Buffy!
Do you mind?
Buffy?
She's dead.
I killed her.
We have to go.
What happened?
There's nothing you can do.
We have to go before someone sees you.
What did I do?
We have to go, now.
All right.
Listen to me.
Buffy.
Buffy!
- She's dead.
- lt was an accident.
But I killed her.
- l'm gonna get you home.
- No.
I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm bed and stay there.
I'm gonna sort this out.
Trust me.
Two problems... one stone.
Nice job.
She totally bought it.
Yeah.
Some of my best work.
Uh, what happens now?
The night's young.
Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
We stick to the plan.
Buffy thinks she killed Katrina.
It's her problem now.
(continuous whispering) What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
(Spike) lt's all right, love.
Shh.
All right. lt'll be our little secret.
Do you trust me?
Hey.
What time is it?
It's late.
I just wanna... I love you.
You know that, right?
What's wrong?
I know I haven't been everything I should be.
Everything Mom was.
But I love you. I always will.
Why are you talking like this?
Buffy?
There was an accident... in the woods.
A girl... she was hurt.
I hurt someone.
Oh, my God.
is she all right?
No.
I'm sorry.
There's something I have to do.
I have to tell what I did.
I have to go to the police.
The police?
Dawnie, I have to.
But...
What's going to happen?
I don't know.
They'll take you away, won't they?
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You're never here.
You can't even stand to be around me.
- That's not true.
- You don't wanna be here with me.
You didn't wanna come back. I know that.
You were happier where you were.
You wanna go away again.
Dawn...
Then go.
You're not really here anyway.
(siren)
- (Spike) What do you think you're doing?
- The right thing.
For once.
Sorry, love.
Can't let you do that.
- l have to tell them what happened.
- Nothing happened.
I killed that girl.
Demons in the woods?
Time going wonky?
They won't believe you.
- l'll show them.
- Show them what?
- What did you do?
- l took care of it.
- What did you do?
!
- What I had to.
I went back and I took care of it.
It doesn't matter now.
No one'll ever find her.
- Where'd they find her?
- The river, half a mile from the cemetery.
Oh, balls!
- There is nothing to connect this to you.
- lt doesn't matter.
- lt wasn't your fault.
- l killed her!
- lt was an accident. ltjust happened.
- Nothing just happens.
You are not going in there.
I have to do this.
Just let me go.
I can't. I love you.
No, you don't.
You think I haven't tried not to?
Try harder.
You are not throwing your life away over this.
- lt's not your choice.
- Why are you doing this to yourself?
A girl is dead because of me!
How many people are alive because of you?
How many have you saved?
One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
That's all it is to you, isn't it?
Just another body.
Buffy!
You can't understand why this is killing me.
Why don't you explain it?
That's it, put it on me.
Put it all on me.
- That's my girl.
- l am not your girl!
You don't have a soul!
There is nothing good or clean in you.
You are dead inside!
You can't feel anything real!
I could never be your girl!
You always hurt... the one you love, pet.
Buffy?
Buffy.
No, no statements.
Not until I get confirmation.
- Excuse me. I need to...
- l'll be with you in a sec.
Sunnydale PD?
Yeah.
Phone's ringing off the hook here.
Listen, you got an id on that body yet?
Yeah?
OK, shoot.
Katrina...
Silber.
S-i-l-b-e-r.
- (Katrina) Warren, tell her to go away.
- l can't.
You're keeping secrets from me - other girls and...
Trina... shut up.
- Warren.
- Thanks.
Now, what's the problem, miss?
- (Anya) ls this what you saw?
- Yeah, that's it.
Hm.
Rwasundi.
Very rare.
Its presence in our dimension causes a sort of...
localised temporal disturbance.
- So that's why time went all "David Lynch"?
- Right.
Human perception is based on a linear chronology.
Being exposed to the Rwasundi for a few seconds can cause vivid hallucinations.
And a slight tingly scalp.
So that's it.
These things just made you think you killed her.
She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
It wasn't the demon.
It was Warren.
He knew Katrina.
He had something to do with it, I know it.
How can you be sure?
You always hurt the one you love.
Does this mean you're not going away?
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
We need to find Warren and the others.
Whatever they've done, they won't get away with it.
We'll get away with it. "injuries consistent with a fall." The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
What about Buffy?
It wasn't that hard messing her game up.
If she figures it out... we'll take care of her.
We really got away with murder.
That's... kinda cool.
Yeah.
Cool.
- Are you sure?
- l've double-checked everything.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Then why can Spike hurt me?
Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but... you are different.
Shifting you out of... from where you were, funnelling your essence back into your body, it altered you on a basic molecular level.
Probably just enough to confuse the sensors, or whatever, in Spike's chip.
But it's all surfacey physical stuff. lt wouldn't have any more effect than... bad sunburn.
I didn't come back wrong?
No, you're the same Buffy.
With a deep tropical cellular tan.
You must have missed something.
Will you check again?
I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
There has to be.
This just can't be me. lt isn't me.
Why do I feel like this?
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
You mean, hit you?
Oh.
Oh... really?
He's everything I hate.
He's everything that I'm supposed to be against.
But the only time that I ever feel anything is when...
- Don't tell anyone.
Please?
- l won't.
Oh, the way they would look at me!
I just couldn't... I won't tell anyone. I wouldn't do that.
Why can't I stop?
Why do I keep letting him in?
Do you love him?
It's OK if you do.
He's done a lot of good, and he does love you.
And, Buffy, it's OK if you don't.
You're going through a really hard time, and you're...
What?
Using him?
What's OK about that?
- lt's not that simple.
- lt is. lt's wrong.
I'm wrong.
Tell me that I'm wrong, please.
Please don't forgive me.
Please!
God!
Please don't...
Please don't forgive me.
Please don't...

- Previously:
- We screwed it up.
She's just disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
That the kinda demon you are?
I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
So, you three have, what?
Banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch Nemesises.
- Dawn, you need to eat.
- Thanks for your concern.
Why is she taking it out on you?
- This isn't gonna work.
- Are you gonna leave me?
- Willow has a problem.
- No more spells.
I'm finished.
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Afraid I'm gonna...?
- Things have changed.
- I'm disgusted with myself.
We missed the bed again.
Lucky for the bed.
Is this a new rug?
No.
Just looks different when you're under it.
You know, this place is OK for a hole in the ground.
You fixed it up.
Well, I ate a decorator once.
Maybe something stuck.
- I've been thinking of changing my room.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I think the New Kids on the Block posters are starting to date me.
Well, if you want, I can...
Are we having a conversation?
What?
No!
No.
- Maybe.
- Huh.
What?
Isn't this usually the part where you kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
That's the plan.
Soon as my legs start working.
You were amazing.
You got the job done yourself.
I was just trying to keep up.
The things you do.
The way you make it hurt in all the wrong places.
I've never been with such an animal.
I'm not an animal.
You wanna see the bite marks?
You know, it's late.
I should get home before Dawn goes to sleep.
- And she's off.
- Have you seen my underwear?
What is this to you, this thing we have?
What?
We don't have a... thing.
We have... this.
That's all.
Do you even like me?
Sometimes.
But you like what I do to you.
Do you trust me?
Never.
How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
Actually living with super villains was not in the deal.
We're on the lam.
It's not like we have a choice.
This sucks.
Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
Stop whining!
Get your sissy crap out of the way!
Hey, quit it!
Don't you curse me.
Hey, give me my bone!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Hey!
When you girls are done, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.
Cool.
Got the thing?
- Musk gland of a Hombja'moleev demon.
Fresh.
All right.
Stand back.
Doma voluntatem.
Libere cupidinem.
Arumpe ignem.
Excita.
OK.
Ow.
Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener is on line.
Now, with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave.
I know just where to start.
- Doublemeat is double sweet.
Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- Just something I'm tryin'.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, time has no meaning here.
Gina, I'm takin' a break.
I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
If you close your eyes and smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away.
Eventually.
I'm hoping.
Thanks for coming by.
Is it bad?
I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
I knew this was gonna happen.
What did Willow do now?
Did she... hurt anyone?
What?
No, no.
Um...
Tara, this isn't about Willow.
I thought that's why you didn't want to meet at the house.
Sorry.
It's...
Willow's fine.
She's been doing really well.
You'd be proud of her.
Good.
That's good.
So what do you want to talk about?
It's Spike.
He can hurt me... without his head exploding.
Oh, my God.
His chip stopped working?
No.
It still works.
Just not on me.
I need to know about the spell, the one that brought me back.
I...
I'd ask Willow, but...
You think it's you.
I don't know.
I feel... different.
There are things that...
I think... maybe...
I came back wrong.
No, Buffy.
That's not...
No.
You didn't.
Can you check out the spell?
Just see if there's something that...
Could you just check?
Please?
Right there!
That's got it.
Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
Mad Dog Three to Mad Dog One.
- Signal's strong and clear.
Over.
- Roger that.
Beginning preliminary sweep.
Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer.
I don't want any surprises.
We can really have anyone we want.
- It's like candy.
- Juicy, pulsating candy.
Oh!
The one with the neck.
Put the whammy on the neck!
No.
I want the redhead!
The redhead's too tall.
- Get off of me!
Jerk!
- Take it back!
- Target acquired.
- What?
Initiating contact.
- The brunette?
- Oh, she's kinda cute.
Ow!
- Oh, no.
Go for the leather skirt!
- Bazoombas!
- Yeah.
Go for the one with the bazoombas.
- Bazoombas.
Bazoombas.
So how did you get so beautiful?
OK.
Does that line usually wor...?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's nice to see you, too, Katrina.
It's the seeing you that's throwing me.
I thought I was pretty clear I never wanted that to happen again.
- Never's a long time, baby.
- Apparently, not long enough.
You're not still sore about that thing, are you?
What thing would that be, exactly?
The wind-up slut you tinkered together?
Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
OK.
So I've made a few mistakes.
No.
No, I did.
For ever lowering myself to be with a jerk like you.
- No.
Don't say that.
- Well, what did you expect?
To just waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?
No.
I just thought we could talk.
I thought maybe we could work things out.
There is nothing to work out.
What you did was sick.
Just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.
God!
Yes, I'm sure.
I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
I'm home!
Who wants to help scrape the grease off my...
- Is there singing?
Are we singing again?
- No.
Just the dancin'.
We're teaching Dawn synchronised dance steps for the wedding reception.
Wanna go for a spin?
I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse.
- Oh.
Rough day?
- Kinda.
You've been goin' at it too hard.
We hardly ever see you.
What with slinging' the Doublemeat and pounding' the big evil.
You are looking a little pounded.
Just around the eyes.
Hey, we're thinking of heading to the Bronze later.
Wanna come?
Get all unwindy?
Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me.
Nectar of the working man.
- No.
I'll stay here with Dawn.
Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and... listen to the cars honk?
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping over at Janice's.
I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
It's OK.
I checked it out.
Janice's mom is picking her up.
Oh.
I didn't think you'd care.
You're never home, so...
I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'm here now, all visible and everything.
- Can't you stay at Janice's another night?
- Her mom's cooking Mexican.
She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas.
- Not like I knew you'd be around.
Frosty nectar.
Now, please?
- Thank you, baby.
- My pleasure, Master.
That is so cool.
I could've used one of these in high school.
Gentlemen.
To crime.
Crime.
- Crime tastes funny.
- Wow.
I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but...
Wow!
Yeah, she's... really cute.
Cute?
Look at her, men.
The shape of her lips.
The smooth, silky skin.
The way her nose crinkles when she laughs.
She's perfect.
- Yeah.
- She's totally hot.
So are you, Master.
- You think so?
- Oh yes, Master.
OK.
So... how do we...?
- You know?
- Who gets to...?
- I do.
- That's not fair.
- Dude, you didn't call it.
- I don't have to call it.
She's mine.
But don't worry.
You can play with her all you want.
After I'm done with her.
I missed you so much.
You never should have left me.
- Say it.
- I never should have left you, Master.
- Now tell me you love me.
- I love you, Master.
- Again.
- I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
Get on your knees.
Yes, Warren.
Wait.
What'd you just say?
I said "Yes, Warr..."
What the...?
What did you do to me?
!
- Get the dampener!
- Who the hell are you?
- Um, your masters.
- My what?
!
- Where'd you put it?
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Get the dampener!
- You were sharing me with these dorks?
!
Hey!
We're super villains!
- Call us "master".
- Wait!
- Oh, crap.
- It's out of juice.
Is that what you used on me?
Oh, my God!
First the skankbot and now this?
- What is wrong with you?
!
- I wanted us to be together.
There is no us!
Get that through your meaty head.
I am not your girlfriend any more!
- She's your ex?
- Dude, that is messed up.
Oh, you think?
You bunch of little boys playing at being men?
Well, this is not some fantasy.
It's not a game, you freaks!
It's rape!
- What?
- No, we didn't...
You're all sick.
And I'm gonna make sure you get locked up for this.
- Then we'll see how you like getting raped!
- Stop her!
Get off me!
Charge the cerebral dampener.
- Warren...
- Charge the dampener.
Andrew, get her up.
We'll give her another dose.
A stronger one.
Everything's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I don't think so.
She's dead.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Her neck, it just...
No, that's... not...
- This isn't happening.
- I just...
I gotta...
I gotta...
Let me think.
What'd you do?
What the hell did you do?
!
We did this, me and Andrew and you.
It's on all of us.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Shut up!
We have to get...
We have to get rid of it.
How?
Maybe a spell.
Can you teleport it outta here?
No.
She's...
It's too big.
Andrew?
- Andrew?
- What?
Is there anything that you can summon, something that...
something that can devour that much?
Maybe a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater, but they're hard to control.
It'd go for us, too.
Well, that's it, man.
We're screwed.
- Stay calm.
- Tell that to your girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend!
- It doesn't matter.
There's a link.
You knew her, so there's a link.
You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together?
She'll figure it out!
It was an accident.
Maybe we could turn ourselves in.
- No.
- If we go to the police now...
- No.
I'm not going to jail.
- We can't hide this!
Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead!
Well, then maybe it should be sooner.
- Are you insane?
- Listen.
- No!
- Listen!
We have two problems:
the body and the Slayer.
Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both, with one big stone?
What are they doing? We're not gonna have to do that at the wedding?
Cos there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
You're still doing OK, right?
Yeah.
You know, some days are harder than the really hard days.
It's easier like this, though, when I'm not alone.
- I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
- No, that's not...
It's OK.
We know you've been all tied up.
- What?
- With your job and the slaying.
I see sitting where there should be dancing.
- Come share in the joy of our groove thing.
- And despite that, I succumb to the beat.
- I think I'll catch the next soul train out.
- You sure?
Oh, yeah.
You know, glass all the way empty.
More nectar required.
Cool.
Well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricatin'.
You see?
You try to be with them.
But you'll always end up in the dark.
With me.
What would they think of you if they found out... all the things you've done?
If they knew... who you really were?
Don't.
Stop me.
No, don't close your eyes.
Look at them.
That's not your world.
You belong in the shadows.
With me.
Look at your friends, and tell me you don't love getting away with this... right under their noses.
Oh!
I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
The funky monkey claims another victim.
Tara.
What are you doing here?
I mean...
Uh, it's OK for you to be here if you have things that you have to be here for.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
- There's a monkey problem?
- Only if you don't stretch first.
The Brekenkrieg Grimoire?
Light reading?
Yeah.
I was just...
No, it's OK.
I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because...
You don't have to hide it.
I'm not...
I'm doing better.
No spells for 32 days.
I can even go to the magic shop now, as long as someone's with me at all times.
But, uh...
But it's better now.
It really is.
You know, if you were checking on me?
No, I wouldn't...
- I was just looking for Buffy.
- Oh.
Well, I haven't seen her since last night.
She's not around much these days.
We kinda miss her.
I'm sure she feels the same way.
If you see her, can you tell her that I need to talk to her?
It's important.
- Yeah.
Of course I will.
- Thanks.
Will?
I'm...
I'm glad you're doing better.
Don't think about the evil, bloodsucking fiend.
Focus on anything but the evil fiend.
Thank you.
Huh?
It's OK.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you walk?
Are you hurt? What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
Ow!
Bloody hell!
What'd you do that for?
Spike?
Buffy!
Spike.
What's happening?
So you thought you could just slip away, then?
Vampire, remember?
I could feel you.
Ow!
Bloody hell!
What'd you do that for?
Buffy!
Buffy!
Do you mind?
Buffy?
She's dead.
I killed her.
We have to go.
What happened?
There's nothing you can do.
We have to go before someone sees you.
What did I do?
We have to go, now.
All right.
Listen to me.
Buffy.
Buffy!
- She's dead.
- It was an accident.
But I killed her.
- I'm gonna get you home.
- No.
I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm bed and stay there.
I'm gonna sort this out.
Trust me.
Two problems... one stone.
Nice job.
She totally bought it.
Yeah.
Some of my best work.
Uh, what happens now?
The night's young.
Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
We stick to the plan.
Buffy thinks she killed Katrina.
It's her problem now.
What did you do,Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
It's all right, love.
Shh.
All right.
It'll be our little secret.
Do you trust me?
Hey.
What time is it?
It's late.
I just wanna...
I love you.
You know that, right?
What's wrong?
I know I haven't been everything I should be.
Everything Mom was.
But I love you.
I always will.
Why are you talking like this?
Buffy?
There was an accident... in the woods.
A girl... she was hurt.
I hurt someone.
Oh, my God.
Is she all right?
No.
I'm sorry.
There's something I have to do.
I have to tell what I did.
I have to go to the police.
The police?
Dawnie, I have to.
But...
What's going to happen?
I don't know.
They'll take you away, won't they?
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You're never here.
You can't even stand to be around me.
- That's not true.
- You don't wanna be here with me.
You didn't wanna come back.
I know that.
You were happier where you were.
You wanna go away again.
Dawn...
Then go.
You're not really here anyway.
- What do you think you're doing?
- The right thing.
For once.
Sorry, love.
Can't let you do that.
- I have to tell them what happened.
- Nothing happened.
I killed that girl.
Demons in the woods?
Time going wonky?
They won't believe you.
- I'll show them.
- Show them what?
- What did you do?
- I took care of it.
- What did you do?
!
- What I had to.
I went back and I took care of it.
It doesn't matter now.
No one'll ever find her.
- Where'd they find her?
- The river, half a mile from the cemetery.
Oh, balls!
- There is nothing to connect this to you.
- It doesn't matter.
- It wasn't your fault.
- I killed her!
- It was an accident.
It just happened.
- Nothing just happens.
You are not going in there.
I have to do this.
Just let me go.
I can't.
I love you.
No, you don't.
You think I haven't tried not to?
Try harder.
You are not throwing your life away over this.
- It's not your choice.
- Why are you doing this to yourself?
A girl is dead because of me!
How many people are alive because of you?
How many have you saved?
One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
That's all it is to you, isn't it?
Just another body.
Buffy!
You can't understand why this is killing me.
Why don't you explain it?
That's it, put it on me.
Put it all on me.
- That's my girl.
- I am not your girl!
You don't have a soul!
There is nothing good or clean in you.
You are dead inside!
You can't feel anything real!
I could never be your girl!
You always hurt... the one you love, pet.
Buffy?
Buffy.
No, no statements.
Not until I get confirmation.
- Excuse me.
I need to...
- I'll be with you in a sec.
Sunnydale PD?
Yeah.
Phone's ringing off the hook here.
Listen, you got an ID on that body yet?
Yeah?
OK, shoot.
Katrina...
Silber.
S-i-l-b-e-r.
- Warren, tell her to go away.
- I can't.
You're keeping secrets from me - other girls and...
Trina... shut up.
- Warren.
- Thanks.
Now, what's the problem, miss?
- Is this what you saw?
- Yeah, that's it.
Hm.
Rwasundi.
Very rare.
Its presence in our dimension causes a sort of...
localised temporal disturbance.
- So that's why time went all "David Lynch"?
- Right.
Human perception is based on a linear chronology.
Being exposed to the Rwasundi for a few seconds can cause vivid hallucinations.
And a slight tingly scalp.
So that's it.
These things just made you think you killed her.
She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
It wasn't the demon.
It was Warren.
He knew Katrina.
He had something to do with it, I know it.
How can you be sure?
You always hurt the one you love.
Does this mean you're not going away?
Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere.
We need to find Warren and the others.
Whatever they've done, they won't get away with it.
We'll get away with it. "injuries consistent with a fall." The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
What about Buffy?
It wasn't that hard messing her game up.
If she figures it out... we'll take care of her.
We really got away with murder.
That's... kinda cool.
Yeah.
Cool.
- Are you sure?
- I've double-checked everything.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Then why can Spike hurt me?
Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but... you are different.
Shifting you out of... from where you were, funnelling your essence back into your body, it altered you on a basic molecular level.
Probably just enough to confuse the sensors, or whatever, in Spike's chip.
But it's all surfacey physical stuff.
It wouldn't have any more effect than... bad sunburn.
I didn't come back wrong?
No, you're the same Buffy.
With a deep tropical cellular tan.
You must have missed something.
Will you check again?
I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
There has to be.
This just can't be me.
It isn't me.
Why do I feel like this?
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
You mean, hit you?
Oh.
Oh... really?
He's everything I hate.
He's everything that I'm supposed to be against.
But the only time that I ever feel anything is when...
- Don't tell anyone.
Please?
- I won't.
Oh, the way they would look at me!
I just couldn't...
I won't tell anyone.
I wouldn't do that.
Why can't I stop?
Why do I keep letting him in?
Do you love him?
It's OK if you do.
He's done a lot of good, and he does love you.
And, Buffy, it's OK if you don't.
You're going through a really hard time, and you're...
What?
Using him?
What's OK about that?
- It's not that simple.
- It is.
It's wrong.
I'm wrong.
Tell me that I'm wrong, please.
Please don't forgive me.
Please!
God!
Please don't...
Please don't forgive me.
Please don't...
- Previously:
- We screwed it up.
She's just disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
That the kinda demon you are?
I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
So, you three have, what?
Banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch Nemesises.
- Dawn, you need to eat.
- Thanks for your concern.
Why is she taking it out on you?
- This isn't gonna work.
- Are you gonna leave me?
- Willow has a problem.
- No more spells.
I'm finished.
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Afraid I'm gonna...?
- Things have changed.
- I'm disgusted with myself.
We missed the bed again.
Lucky for the bed.
Is this a new rug?
No.
Just looks different when you're under it.
You know, this place is OK for a hole in the ground.
You fixed it up.
Well, I ate a decorator once.
Maybe something stuck.
- I've been thinking of changing my room.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I think the New Kids on the Block posters are starting to date me.
Well, if you want, I can...
Are we having a conversation?
What?
No.
No.
Maybe.
What?
Isn't this usually the part where you kick me in the head and run out,... virtue fluttering?
That's the plan.
Soon as my legs start working.
You were amazing.
You got the job done yourself.
I was just trying to keep up.
The things you do.
The way you make it hurt in all the wrong places.
I've never been with such an animal.
I'm not an animal.
You wanna see the bite marks?
You know, it's late.
I should get home before Dawn goes to sleep.
- And she's off.
- Have you seen my underwear?
What is this to you, this thing we have?
What?
We don't have a thing.
We have this.
That's all.
Do you even like me?
Sometimes.
But you like what I do to you.
Do you trust me?
Never.
How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
Actually living with supervillains was not in the deal.
We're on the lam.
It's not like we have a choice.
This sucks.
Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
Stop whining.
Get your sissy crap out of the way.
Quit it.
Don't you curse me.
Give me my bone.
When you girls are done, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.
Cool.
Got the thing?
Musk gland of a Hombja'moleev demon.
Fresh.
All right.
Stand back.
Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener is on line.
Now, with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave.
I know just where to start.
- Doublemeat is double sweet.
Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- Just something I'm tryin'.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Time has no meaning here.
Gina, I'm takin' a break.
I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
If you close your eyes and smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away.
Eventually.
I'm hoping.
Thanks for coming by.
Is it bad?
I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
I knew this was gonna happen.
What did Willow do now?
Did she hurt anyone?
What?
No, no.
Tara, this isn't about Willow.
I thought that's why you didn't want to meet at the house.
Sorry.
It's...
Willow's fine.
She's been doing really well.
You'd be proud of her.
Good.
That's good.
So what do you want to talk about?
It's Spike.
He can hurt me... without his head exploding.
Oh, my God.
His chip stopped working?
No.
It still works.
Just not on me.
I need to know about the spell, the one that brought me back.
I'd ask Willow, but...
You think it's you.
I don't know.
I feel different.
There are things that...
I think maybe I came back wrong.
No, Buffy.
That's not...
No.
You didn't.
Can you check out the spell?
Just see if there's something that...
Could you just check?
Please?
Right there.
That's got it.
Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
Mad Dog Three to Mad Dog One.
- Signal's strong and clear.
Over.
- Roger that.
Beginning preliminary sweep.
Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer.
I don't want any surprises.
We can really have anyone we want.
- It's like candy.
- Juicy, pulsating candy.
- The one with the neck.
Put it on her.
- No.
I want the redhead.
The redhead's too tall.
- Get off of me.
Jerk.
- Take it back.
- Target acquired.
- What?
Initiating contact.
- The brunette?
- She's kinda cute.
- No, go for the leather skirt.
- Bazoombas.
- Yeah.
Go for the one with the bazoombas.
- Bazoombas.
Bazoombas.
So how did you get so beautiful?
OK.
Does that line usually wor...?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's nice to see you, too, Katrina.
It's the seeing you that's throwing me.
I thought I was pretty clear I never wanted that to happen again.
- Never's a long time, baby.
- Apparently, not long enough.
You're not still sore about that thing, are you?
What thing would that be, exactly?
The wind-up slut you tinkered together?
Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
OK.
So I've made a few mistakes.
No.
No, I did.
For ever lowering myself to be with a jerk like you.
- No.
Don't say that.
- Well, what did you expect?
To just waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?
No.
I just thought we could talk.
I thought maybe we could work things out.
There is nothing to work out.
What you did was sick.
Just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.
God!
Yes, I'm sure.
I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
I'm home.
Who wants to help scrape the grease off my...
- Is there singing?
Are we singing again?
- No.
Just the dancin'.
We're teaching Dawn synchronised dance steps for the wedding reception.
Wanna go for a spin?
I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse.
- Rough day?
- Kinda.
You've been goin' at it too hard.
We hardly ever see you.
What with slinging' the Doublemeat and pounding' the big evil.
You are looking a little pounded.
Just around the eyes.
We're thinking of heading to the Bronze later.
Wanna come?
Get all unwindy?
Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me.
Nectar of the working man.
No.
I'll stay here with Dawn.
Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and...
listen to the cars honk?
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping over at Janice's.
I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
It's OK.
I checked it out.
Janice's mom is picking her up.
I didn't think you'd care.
You're never home, so...
I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'm here now, all visible and everything.
- Can't you stay at Janice's another night?
- Her mom's cooking Mexican.
She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas.
Not like I knew you'd be around.
Frosty nectar.
Now, please?
- Thank you, baby.
- My pleasure, Master.
That is so cool.
I could've used one of these in high school.
Gentlemen.
To crime.
Crime.
- Crime tastes funny.
- Wow.
I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but...
Wow.
Yeah, she's really cute.
Cute?
Look at her, men.
The shape of her lips.
The smooth, silky skin.
The way her nose crinkles when she laughs.
She's perfect.
- Yeah.
- She's totally hot.
So are you, Master.
- You think so?
- Yes, Master.
OK.
So, how do we...?
- You know?
- Who gets to...?
- I do.
- That's not fair.
- Dude, you didn't call it.
- I don't have to call it.
She's mine.
But don't worry.
You can play with her all you want.
After I'm done with her.
I missed you so much.
You never should have left me.
- Say it.
- I never should have left you, Master.
- Now tell me you love me.
- I love you, Master.
- Again.
- I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
Get on your knees.
Yes, Warren.
Wait.
What'd you just say?
I said "Yes, Warr... "
What the...?
What did you do to me?
- Get the dampener.
- Who the hell are you?
- Your masters.
- My what?
- Where'd you put it?
- Are you kidding me?
- Get the dampener.
- You were sharing me with these dorks?
We're supervillains.
Call us "master".
Wait.
- Crap.
- It's out of juice.
Is that what you used on me?
Oh, my God.
First the skankbot and now this?
- What is wrong with you?
- I wanted us to be together.
There is no us.
Get that through your meaty head.
I am not your girlfriend any more.
- She's your ex?
- Dude, that is messed up.
You think?
You bunch of little boys playing at being men?
Well, this is not some fantasy.
It's not a game, you freaks.
It's rape.
- What?
- No, we didn't...
You're all sick.
And I'm gonna make sure you get locked up for this.
- Then we'll see how you like getting raped.
- Stop her.
Get off me.
Charge the cerebral dampener.
- Warren...
- Charge the dampener.
Andrew, get her up.
We'll give her another dose.
A stronger one.
Everything's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I don't think so.
She's dead.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Her neck, it just...
No, that's not...
- This isn't happening.
- I just...
I gotta...
I gotta...
Let me think.
What'd you do?
What the hell did you do?
We did this, me and Andrew and you.
It's on all of us.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Shut up.
We have to get...
We have to get rid of it.
How?
Maybe a spell.
Can you teleport it outta here?
No.
She's...
It's too big.
Andrew?
- Andrew?
- What?
Is there anything that you can summon, something that can devour that much?
Maybe a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater, but they're hard to control.
It'd go for us, too.
Well, that's it, man.
We're screwed.
- Stay calm.
- Tell that to your girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend.
- It doesn't matter.
There's a link.
You knew her, so there's a link.
You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together?
She'll figure it out.
It was an accident.
Maybe we could turn ourselves in.
- No.
- If we go to the police now...
- No.
I'm not going to jail.
- We can't hide this.
Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead.
Well, then maybe it should be sooner.
- Are you insane?
- Listen.
- No.
- Listen.
We have two problems:
the body and the Slayer.
Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both, with one big stone?
What are they doing?
We're not gonna have to do that at the wedding?
Cos there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
You're still doing OK, right?
Yeah.
You know, some days are harder than the really hard days.
It's easier like this, though, when I'm not alone.
- I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
- No, that's not...
It's OK.
We know you've been all tied up.
- What?
- With your job and the slaying.
I see sitting where there should be dancing.
- Come share in the joy of our groove thing.
- And despite that, I succumb to the beat.
- I think I'll catch the next soul train out.
- You sure?
Oh, yeah.
You know, glass all the way empty.
More nectar required.
Cool.
Well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricatin'.
You see?
You try to be with them.
But you'll always end up in the dark.
With me.
What would they think of you if they found out all the things you've done?
If they knew who you really were?
Don't.
Stop me.
No, don't close your eyes.
Look at them.
That's not your world.
You belong in the shadows.
With me.
Look at your friends, and tell me you don't love getting away with this... right under their noses.
I pulled a jive muscle last night.
The funky monkey claims another victim.
Tara.
What are you doing here?
I mean, it's OK for you to be here if you have things that you have to be here for.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
- There's a monkey problem?
- Only if you don't stretch first.
The Brekenkrieg Grimoire?
Light reading?
Yeah.
I was just...
No, it's OK.
I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because...
You don't have to hide it.
I'm not...
I'm doing better.
No spells for 32 days.
I can even go to the magic shop now, as long as someone's with me at all times.
But it's better now.
It really is.
You know, if you were checking on me?
No, I wouldn't...
I was just looking for Buffy.
Well, I haven't seen her since last night.
She's not around much these days.
We kinda miss her.
I'm sure she feels the same way.
If you see her, can you tell her that I need to talk to her?
It's important.
- Yeah.
Of course I will.
- Thanks.
Will?
I'm glad you're doing better.
Don't think about the evil, bloodsucking fiend.
Focus on anything but the evil fiend.
Thank you.
It's OK.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you walk?
Are you hurt?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
Bloody hell.
What'd you do that for?
Spike?
Buffy.
Spike.
What's happening?
So you thought you could just slip away, then?
Vampire, remember?
I could feel you.
Bloody hell.
What'd you do that for?
Buffy.
Buffy.
Do you mind?
Buffy?
She's dead.
I killed her.
We have to go.
What happened?
There's nothing you can do.
We have to go before someone sees you.
What did I do?
We have to go, now.
All right.
Listen to me.
Buffy.
Buffy.
- She's dead.
- It was an accident.
But I killed her.
- I'm gonna get you home.
- No.
I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm bed and stay there.
I'm gonna sort this out.
Trust me.
Two problems, one stone.
Nice job.
She totally bought it.
Yeah.
Some of my best work.
What happens now?
The night's young.
Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
We stick to the plan.
Buffy thinks she killed Katrina.
It's her problem now.
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
It's all right, love.
All right.
It'll be our little secret.
Do you trust me?
Hey.
What time is it?
It's late.
I just wanna...
I love you.
You know that, right?
What's wrong?
I know I haven't been everything I should be.
Everything Mom was.
But I love you.
I always will.
Why are you talking like this?
Buffy?
There was an accident, in the woods.
A girl, she was hurt.
I hurt someone.
Oh, my God.
Is she all right?
No.
I'm sorry.
There's something I have to do.
I have to tell what I did.
I have to go to the police.
The police?
Dawnie, I have to.
But...
What's going to happen?
I don't know.
They'll take you away, won't they?
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You're never here.
You can't even stand to be around me.
- That's not true.
- You don't wanna be here with me.
You didn't wanna come back.
I know that.
You were happier where you were.
You wanna go away again.
Dawn...
Then go.
You're not really here anyway.
- What do you think you're doing?
- The right thing.
For once.
Sorry, love.
Can't let you do that.
- I have to tell them what happened.
- Nothing happened.
I killed that girl.
Demons in the woods?
Time going wonky?
They won't believe you.
- I'll show them.
- Show them what?
- What did you do?
- I took care of it.
- What did you do?
- What I had to.
I went back and I took care of it.
It doesn't matter now.
No one'll ever find her.
- Where'd they find her?
- The river, half a mile from the cemetery.
Balls.
- There is nothing to connect this to you.
- It doesn't matter.
- It wasn't your fault.
- I killed her.
- It was an accident.
It just happened.
- Nothing just happens.
You are not going in there.
I have to do this.
Just let me go.
I can't.
I love you.
No, you don't.
You think I haven't tried not to?
Try harder.
You are not throwing your life away over this.
- It's not your choice.
- Why are you doing this to yourself?
A girl is dead because of me.
How many people are alive because of you?
How many have you saved?
One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
That's all it is to you, isn't it?
Just another body.
Buffy.
You can't understand why this is killing me.
Why don't you explain it?
That's it, put it on me.
Put it all on me.
- That's my girl.
- I am not your girl.
You don't have a soul.
There is nothing good or clean in you.
You are dead inside.
You can't feel anything real.
I could never be your girl.
You always hurt the one you love, pet.
Buffy?
Buffy.
No, no statements.
Not until I get confirmation.
- Excuse me.
I need to...
- I'll be with you in a sec.
Sunnydale PD?
Yeah.
Phone's ringing off the hook here.
Listen, you got an ID on that body yet?
Yeah?
OK, shoot.
Katrina Silber.
S- i-I-b-e-r.
- Warren, tell her to go away.
- I can't.
You're keeping secrets from me - other girls and...
Trina, shut up.
- Warren.
- Thanks.
Now, what's the problem, miss?
- Is this what you saw?
- Yeah, that's it.
Rwasundi.
Very rare.
Its presence in our dimension causes a sort of... localised temporal disturbance.
- So that's why time went all "David Lynch"?
- Right.
Human perception is based on a linear chronology.
Being exposed to the Rwasundi for a few seconds can cause vivid hallucinations.
And a slight tingly scalp.
So that's it.
These things just made you think you killed her.
She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
It wasn't the demon.
It was Warren.
He knew Katrina.
He had something to do with it, I know it.
How can you be sure?
You always hurt the one you love.
Does this mean you're not going away?
Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere.
We need to find Warren and the others.
Whatever they've done, they won't get away with it.
We'll get away with it.
"Injuries consistent with a fall.
" The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
What about Buffy?
It wasn't that hard messing her game up.
If she figures it out, we'll take care of her.
We really got away with murder.
That's kinda cool.
Yeah.
Cool.
- Are you sure?
- I've double-checked everything.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Then why can Spike hurt me?
Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but you are different.
Shifting you out of... from where you were, funnelling your essence back into your body, it altered you on a basic molecular level.
Probably just enough to confuse the sensors, or whatever, in Spike's chip.
But it's all surfacey physical stuff.
It wouldn't have any more effect than bad sunburn.
I didn't come back wrong?
No, you're the same Buffy.
With a deep tropical cellular tan.
You must have missed something.
Will you check again?
I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
There has to be.
This just can't be me.
It isn't me.
Why do I feel like this?
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
You mean, hit you?
Really?
He's everything I hate.
He's everything that I'm supposed to be against.
But the only time that I ever feel anything is when...
- Don't tell anyone.
Please?
- I won't.
The way they would look at me.
I just couldn't...
I won't tell anyone.
I wouldn't do that.
Why can't I stop?
Why do I keep letting him in?
Do you love him?
It's OK if you do.
He's done a lot of good, and he does love you.
And, Buffy, it's OK if you don't.
You're going through a really hard time, and you're...
What?
Using him?
What's OK about that?
- It's not that simple.
- It is.
It's wrong.
I'm wrong.
Tell me that I'm wrong, please.
Please don't forgive me.
Please.
God!
Please don't...
Please don't forgive me.
Please don't...
She's just disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
That the kinda demon you are?
I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
So, you three have, what?
Banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch nemesises.
- Dawn, you need to eat.
- Thanks for your concern.
Why is she taking it out on you?
- This isn't gonna work.
- Are you gonna leave me?
- Willow has a problem.
- No more spells.
I'm finished.
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Afraid I'm gonna...?
- Things have changed.
- I'm disgusted with myself.
We missed the bed again.
Lucky for the bed.
Is this a new rug?
No.
Just looks different when you're under it.
You know, this place is OK for a hole in the ground.
You fixed it up.
Well, I ate a decorator once.
Maybe something stuck.
- I've been thinking of changing my room.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I think the New Kids on the Block posters are starting to date me.
Well, if you want, I can...
Are we having a conversation?
What?
No!
No.
Maybe.
What?
Isn't this usually the part where you kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
Thas the plan.
Soon as my legs start working.
You were amazing.
You got the job done yourself.
I was just trying to keep up.
The things you do.
The way you make it hurt in all the wrong places.
I've never been with such an animal.
I'm not an animal.
You wanna see the bite marks?
You know, is late.
I should get home before Dawn goes to sleep.
- And she's off.
- Have you seen my underwear?
What is this to you, this thing we have?
What?
We don't have a...thing.
We have...this.
Thas all.
Do you even like me?
Sometimes.
But you like what I do to you.
Do you trust me?
Never.
How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
Actually living with supervillains was not in the deal.
We're on the lam.
Is not like we have a choice.
This sucks.
Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
Stop whining!
Get your sissy crap out of the way!
Hey, quit it!
Don't you curse me.
Hey, give me my bone!
When you girls are done, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.
Cool.
Got the thing?
Musk gland of a Hombja'moleev demon.
Fresh.
All right.
Stand back.
Doma voluntatem.
Libere cupidinem.
Arumpe ignem.
Excita.
OK.
Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener is on line.
Now, with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave.
I know just where to start.
- Doublemeat is double sweet.
Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- Just something I'm tryin'.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, time has no meaning here.
Gina, I'm takin' a break.
I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
If you close your eyes and smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, ill go away.
Eventually.
I'm hoping.
Thanks for coming by.
Is it bad?
I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
I knew this was gonna happen.
What did Willow do now?
Did she...hurt anyone?
What?
No, no.
Um...
Tara, this isn't about Willow.
I thought thas why you didn't want to meet at the house.
Sorry.
Is...
Willow's fine.
She's been doing really well.
You'd be proud of her.
Good.
Thas good.
So what do you want to talk about?
Is Spike.
He can hurt me... without his head exploding.
Oh, my God.
His chip stopped working?
No.
It still works.
Just not on me.
I need to know about the spell, the one that brought me back.
I...
I'd ask Willow, but...
You think is you.
I don't know.
I feel...different.
There are things that...
I think...maybe...
I came back wrong.
No, Buffy.
Thas not...
No.
You didn't.
Can you check out the spell?
Just see if there's something that...
Could you just check?
Please?
Right there!
Thas got it.
Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
Mad Dog Three to Mad Dog One.
- Signal's strong and clear.
Over.
- Roger that.
Beginning preliminary sweep.
Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer.
I don't want any surprises.
We can really have anyone we want.
- Is like candy.
- Juicy, pulsating candy.
Oh!
The one with the neck.
Put the whammy on the neck!
No.
I want the redhead!
The redheaïs too tall.
- Get off of me!
Jerk!
- Take it back!
- Target acquired.
- What?
Initiating contact.
- The brunette?
- Oh, she's kinda cute.
Ow!
- Oh, no.
Go for the leather skirt!
- Bazoombas!
- Yeah.
Go for the one with the bazoombas.
- Bazoombas.
Bazoombas.
So how did you get so beautiful?
OK.
Does that line usually wor...?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Is nice to see you, too, Katrina.
Is the seeing you thas throwing me.
I thought I was pretty clear I never wanted that to happen again.
- Never's a long time, baby.
- Apparently, not long enough.
You're not still sore about that thing, are you?
What thing would that be, exactly?
The wind- up slut you tinkered together?
Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
OK.
So I've made a few mistakes.
No.
No, I did.
For ever lowering myself to be with a jerk like you.
- No.
Don't say that.
- Well, what did you expect?
To just waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?
No.
I just thought we could talk.
I thought maybe we could work things out.
There is nothing to work out.
What you did was sick.
Just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.
God!
yes, I'm sure.
I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
I'm home!
Who wants to help scrape the grease off my...
- Is there singing?
Are we singing again?
- No.
Just the dancin'.
We're teaching Dawn synchronised dance steps for the wedding reception.
Wanna go for a spin?
I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse.
- Oh.
Rough day?
- Kinda.
You've been goin' at it too hard.
We hardly ever see you.
What with slinging' the Doublemeat and pounding' the big evil.
You are looking a little pounded.
Just around the eyes.
Hey, we're thinking of heading to the Bronze later.
Wanna come?
Get all unwindy?
Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me.
Nectar of the working man.
No.
I'll stay here with Dawn.
Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and... listen to the cars honk?
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping over at Janice's.
I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
Is OK.
I checked it out.
Janice's mom is picking her up.
I didn't think you'd care.
You're never home, so...
I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'm here now, all visible and everything.
- Can't you stay at Janice's another night?
- Her mom's cooking Mexican.
She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas.
Not like I knew you'd be around.
Frosty nectar.
Now, please?
- Thank you, baby.
- My pleasure, Master.
That is so cool.
I coulïve used one of these in high school.
Gentlemen.
To crime.
Crime.
- Crime tastes funny.
- Wow.
I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but...
Wow!
Yeah, she's...really cute.
Cute?
Look at her, men.
The shape of her lips.
The smooth, silky skin.
The way her nose crinkles when she laughs.
She's perfect.
- Yeah.
- She's totally hot.
So are you, Master.
- You think so?
- Oh yes, Master.
OK.
So...how do we...?
- You know?
- Who gets to...?
- I do.
- Thas not fair.
- Dude, you didn't call it.
- I don't have to call it.
She's mine.
But don't worry.
You can play with her all you want.
After I'm done with her.
I missed you so much.
You never should have left me.
- Say it.
- I never should have left you, Master.
- Now tell me you love me.
- I love you, Master.
- Again.
- I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
Get on your knees.
Yes, Warren.
Wait.
Whad you just say?
I said "Yes, Warr..."
What the...?
What did you do to me?
- Get the dampener!
- Who the hell are you?
- Um, your masters.
- My what?
- Where'd you put it?
- Are you kidding me?
- Get the dampener!
- You were sharing me with these dorks?
Hey!
We're supervillains!
- Call us "master".
- Wait!
- Oh, crap.
- Is out of juice.
Is that what you used on me?
Oh, my God!
First the skankbot and now this?
- What is wrong with you?
- I wanted us to be together.
There is no us!
Get that through your meaty head.
I am not your girlfriend any more!
- She's your ex?
- Dude, that is messed up.
Oh, you think?
You bunch of little boys playing at being men?
Well, this is not some fantasy.
Is not a game, you freaks!
Is rape!
- What?
- No, we didn't...
You're all sick.
And I'm gonna make sure you get locked up for this.
- Then we'll see how you like getting raped!
- Stop her!
Get off me!
Charge the cerebral dampener.
- Warren...
- Charge the dampener.
Andrew, get her up.
We'll give her another dose.
A stronger one.
Everything's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I don't think so.
She's dead.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Her neck, it just...
No, thas...not...
- This isn't happening.
- I just...
I gotta...
I gotta...
Let me think.
Whad you do?
What the hell did you do?
We did this, me and Andrew and you.
Is on all of us.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Shut up!
We have to get...
We have to get rid of it.
How?
Maybe a spell.
Can you teleport it outta here?
No.
She's...
Is too big.
Andrew?
- Andrew?
- What?
Is there anything that you can summon, something that...
Something that can devour that much?
Maybe a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater, but they're hard to control.
Id go for us, too.
Well, thas it, man.
We're screwed.
- Stay calm.
- Tell that to your girlfriend.
- EX- girlfriend!
- It doesn't matter.
There's a link.
You knew her, so there's a link.
You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together?
She'll figure it out!
It was an accident.
Maybe we could turn ourselves in.
- No.
- If we go to the police now...
- No.
I'm not going to jail.
- We can't hide this!
Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead!
Well, then maybe it should be sooner.
- Are you insane?
- Listen.
- No!
- Listen!
We have two problems.
the body and the Slayer.
Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both, with one big stone?
What are they doing?
We're not gonna have to do that at the wedding?
Cos there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
You're still doing OK, right?
Yeah.
You know, some days are harder than the really hard days.
Is easier like this, though, when I'm not alone.
- I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
- No, thas not...
Is OK.
We know you've been all tied up.
- What?
- With your job and the slaying.
I see sitting where there should be dancing.
- Come share in the joy of our groove thing.
- And despite that, I succumb to the beat.
- I think I'll catch the next soul train out.
- You sure?
Oh, yeah.
You know, glass all the way empty.
More nectar required.
Cool.
Well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricatin'.
You see?
You try to be with them.
But you'll always end up in the dark.
With me.
What would they think of you if they found out...all the things you've done?
If they knew...who you really were?
Don't.
Stop me.
No, don't close your eyes.
Look at them.
Thas not your world.
You belong in the shadows.
With me.
Look at your friends, and tell me you don't love getting away with this... right under their noses.
Oh!
I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
The funky monkey claims another victim.
Tara.
What are you doing here?
I mean...
Uh, is OK for you to be here if you have things that you have to be here for.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
- There's a monkey problem?
- Only if you don't stretch first.
The Brekenkrieg Grimoire?
Light reading?
Yeah.
I was just...
No, is OK.
I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because...
You don't have to hide it.
I'm not...
I'm doing better.
No spells for 32 days.
I can even go to the magic shop now, as long as someone's with me at all times.
But, uh...
But is better now.
It really is.
You know, if you were checking on me?
No, I wouldn't...
I was just looking for Buffy.
Well, I haven't seen her since last night.
She's not around much these days.
We kinda miss her.
I'm sure she feels the same way.
If you see her, can you tell her that I need to talk to her?
Is important.
- Yeah.
Of course I will.
- Thanks.
Will?
I'm...
I'm glad you're doing better.
Don't think about the evil, bloodsucking fiend.
Focus on anything but the evil fiend.
Thank you.
Huh?
Is OK.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you walk?
Are you hurt?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
Ow!
Bloody hell!
Whad you do that for?
Spike?
Buffy!
Spike.
Whas happening?
So you thought you could just slip away, then?
Vampire, remember?
I could feel you.
Ow!
Bloody hell!
Whad you do that for?
Buffy!
Buffy!
Do you mind?
Buffy?
She's dead.
I killed her.
We have to go.
What happened?
There's nothing you can do.
We have to go before someone sees you.
What did I do?
We have to go, now.
All right.
Listen to me.
Buffy.
Buffy!
- She's dead.
- It was an accident.
But I killed her.
- I'm gonna get you home.
- No.
I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm bed and stay there.
I'm gonna sort this out.
Trust me.
Two problems...one stone.
Nice job.
She totally bought it.
Yeah.
Some of my best work.
Uh, what happens now?
The nighs young.
Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
We stick to the plan.
Buffy thinks she killed Katrina.
Is her problem now.
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
Is all right, love.
All right.
Ill be our little secret.
Do you trust me?
Hey.
What time is it?
Is late.
I just wanna...
I love you.
You know that, right?
Whas wrong?
I know I haven't been everything I should be.
Everything Mom was.
But I love you.
I always will.
Why are you talking like this?
Buffy?
There was an accident...in the woods.
A girl...she was hurt.
I hurt someone.
Oh, my God.
Is she all right?
No.
I'm sorry.
There's something I have to do.
I have to tell what I did.
I have to go to the police.
The police?
Dawnie, I have to.
But...
Whas going to happen?
I don't know.
They'll take you away, won't they?
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You're never here.
You can't even stand to be around me.
- Thas not true.
- You don't wanna be here with me.
You didn't wanna come back.
I know that.
You were happier where you were.
You wanna go away again.
Dawn...
Then go.
You're not really here anyway.
- What do you think you're doing?
- The right thing.
For once.
Sorry, love.
Can't let you do that.
- I have to tell them what happened.
- Nothing happened.
I killed that girl.
Demons in the woods?
Time going wonky?
They won't believe you.
- I'll show them.
- Show them what?
- What did you do?
- I took care of it.
- What did you do?
- What I had to.
I went back and I took care of it.
It doesn't matter now.
No one'll ever find her.
- Where'd they find her?
- The river, half a mile from the cemetery.
Oh, balls!
- There is nothing to connect this to you.
- It doesn't matter.
- It wasn't your fault.
- I killed her!
- It was an accident.
It just happened.
- Nothing just happens.
You are not going in there.
I have to do this.
Just let me go.
I can't.
I love you.
No, you don't.
You think I haven't tried not to?
Try harder.
You are not throwing your life away over this.
- Is not your choice.
- Why are you doing this to yourself?
A girl is dead because of me!
How many people are alive because of you?
How many have you saved?
One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
Thas all it is to you, isn't it?
Just another body.
Buffy!
You can't understand why this is killing me.
Why don't you explain it?
Thas it, put it on me.
Put it all on me.
- Thas my girl.
- I am not your girl!
You don't have a soul!
There is nothing good or clean in you.
You are dead inside!
You can't feel anything real!
I could never be your girl!
You always hurt...the one you love, pet.
Buffy?
Buffy.
No, no statements.
Not until I get confirmation.
- Excuse me.
I need to...
- I'll be with you in a sec.
Sunnydale PD?
Yeah.
Phone's ringing off the hook here.
Listen, you got an ID on that body yet?
Yeah?
OK, shoot.
Katrina...
Silber.
S- i- l- b- e- r.
- Warren, tell her to go away.
- I can't.
You're keeping secrets from me - other girls and...
Trina...shut up.
- Warren.
- Thanks.
Now, whas the problem, miss?
- Is this what you saw?
- Yeah, thas it.
Hm.
Rwasundi.
Very rare.
Its presence in our dimension causes a sort of...
localised temporal disturbance.
- So thas why time went all "David Lynch"?
- Right.
Human perception is based on a linear chronology.
Being exposed to the Rwasundi for a few seconds can cause vivid hallucinations.
And a slight tingly scalp.
So thas it.
These things just made you think you killed her.
She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
It wasn't the demon.
It was Warren.
He knew Katrina.
He had something to do with it, I know it.
How can you be sure?
You always hurt the one you love.
Does this mean you're not going away?
Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere.
We need to find Warren and the others.
Whatever they've done, they won't get away with it.
We'll get away with it."Injuries consistent with a fall." The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
What about Buffy?
It wasn't that hard messing her game up.
If she figures it out...we'll take care of her.
We really got away with murder.
Thas...kinda cool.
Yeah.
Cool.
- Are you sure?
- I've double- checked everything.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Then why can Spike hurt me?
Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but...you are different.
Shifting you out of...from where you were, funnelling your essence back into your body, it altered you on a basic molecular level.
Probably just enough to confuse the sensors, or whatever, in Spike's chip.
But is all surfacey physical stuff.
It wouldn't have any more effect than...bad sunburn.
I didn't come back wrong?
No, you're the same Buffy.
With a deep tropical cellular tan.
You must have missed something.
Will you check again?
I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
There has to be.
This just can't be me.
It isn't me.
Why do I feel like this?
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
You mean, hit you?
Oh...really?
He's everything I hate.
He's everything that I'm supposed to be against.
But the only time that I ever feel anything is when...
- Don't tell anyone.
Please?
- I won't.
Oh, the way they would look at me!
I just couldn't...
I won't tell anyone.
I wouldn't do that.
Why can't I stop?
Why do I keep letting him in?
Do you love him?
Is OK if you do.
He's done a lot of good, and he does love you.
And, Buffy, is OK if you don't.
You're going through a really hard time, and you're...
What?
Using him?
Whas OK about that?
- Is not that simple.
- It is.
Is wrong.
I'm wrong.
Tell me that I'm wrong, please.
Please don't forgive me.
Please!
God!
Please don't...
Please don't forgive me.
Please don't...
- Previously:
- We screwed it up.
She's just disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
That the kinda demon you are?
I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
So, you three have, what?
Banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch Nemesises.
- Dawn, you need to eat.
- Thanks for your concern.
Why is she taking it out on you?
- This isn't gonna work.
- Are you gonna leave me?
- Willow has a problem.
- No more spells.
I'm finished.
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Afraid I'm gonna...?
- Things have changed.
- I'm disgusted with myself.
We missed the bed again.
Lucky for the bed.
Is this a new rug?
No.
Just looks different when you're under it.
You know, this place is OK for a hole in the ground.
You fixed it up.
Well, I ate a decorator once.
Maybe something stuck.
- I've been thinking of changing my room.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I think the New Kids on the Block posters are starting to date me.
Well, if you want, I can...
Are we having a conversation?
What?
No!
No.
- Maybe.
- Huh.
What?
Isn't this usually the part where you kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
That's the plan.
Soon as my legs start working.
You were amazing.
You got the job done yourself.
I was just trying to keep up.
The things you do.
The way you make it hurt in all the wrong places.
I've never been with such an animal.
I'm not an animal.
You wanna see the bite marks?
You know, it's late.
I should get home before Dawn goes to sleep.
- And she's off.
- Have you seen my underwear?
What is this to you, this thing we have?
What?
We don't have a... thing.
We have... this.
That's all.
Do you even like me?
Sometimes.
But you like what I do to you.
Do you trust me?
Never.
How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
Actually living with super villains was not in the deal.
We're on the lam.
It's not like we have a choice.
This sucks.
Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
Stop whining!
Get your sissy crap out of the way!
Hey, quit it!
Don't you curse me.
Hey, give me my bone!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Hey!
When you girls are done, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.
Cool.
Got the thing?
- Musk gland of a Hombja'moleev demon.
Fresh.
All right.
Stand back.
Doma voluntatem.
Libere cupidinem.
Arumpe ignem.
Excita.
OK.
Ow.
Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener is on line.
Now, with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave.
I know just where to start.
- Doublemeat is double sweet.
Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- Just something I'm tryin'.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, time has no meaning here.
Gina, I'm takin' a break.
I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
If you close your eyes and smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away.
Eventually.
I'm hoping.
Thanks for coming by.
Is it bad?
I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
I knew this was gonna happen.
What did Willow do now?
Did she... hurt anyone?
What?
No, no.
Um...
Tara, this isn't about Willow.
I thought that's why you didn't want to meet at the house.
Sorry.
It's...
Willow's fine.
She's been doing really well.
You'd be proud of her.
Good.
That's good.
So what do you want to talk about?
It's Spike.
He can hurt me... without his head exploding.
Oh, my God.
His chip stopped working?
No.
It still works.
Just not on me.
I need to know about the spell, the one that brought me back.
I...
I'd ask Willow, but...
You think it's you.
I don't know.
I feel... different.
There are things that...
I think... maybe...
I came back wrong.
No, Buffy.
That's not...
No.
You didn't.
Can you check out the spell?
Just see if there's something that...
Could you just check?
Please?
Right there!
That's got it.
Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
Mad Dog Three to Mad Dog One.
- Signal's strong and clear.
Over.
- Roger that.
Beginning preliminary sweep.
Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer.
I don't want any surprises.
We can really have anyone we want.
- It's like candy.
- Juicy, pulsating candy.
Oh!
The one with the neck.
Put the whammy on the neck!
No.
I want the redhead!
The redhead's too tall.
- Get off of me!
Jerk!
- Take it back!
- Target acquired.
- What?
Initiating contact.
- The brunette?
- Oh, she's kinda cute.
Ow!
- Oh, no.
Go for the leather skirt!
- Bazoombas!
- Yeah.
Go for the one with the bazoombas.
- Bazoombas.
Bazoombas.
So how did you get so beautiful?
OK.
Does that line usually wor...?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's nice to see you, too, Katrina.
It's the seeing you that's throwing me.
I thought I was pretty clear I never wanted that to happen again.
- Never's a long time, baby.
- Apparently, not long enough.
You're not still sore about that thing, are you?
What thing would that be, exactly?
The wind-up slut you tinkered together?
Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
OK.
So I've made a few mistakes.
No.
No, I did.
For ever lowering myself to be with a jerk like you.
- No.
Don't say that.
- Well, what did you expect?
To just waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?
No.
I just thought we could talk.
I thought maybe we could work things out.
There is nothing to work out.
What you did was sick.
Just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.
God!
Yes, I'm sure.
I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
I'm home!
Who wants to help scrape the grease off my...
- Is there singing?
Are we singing again?
- No.
Just the dancin'.
We're teaching Dawn synchronised dance steps for the wedding reception.
Wanna go for a spin?
I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse.
- Oh.
Rough day?
- Kinda.
You've been goin' at it too hard.
We hardly ever see you.
What with slinging' the Doublemeat and pounding' the big evil.
You are looking a little pounded.
Just around the eyes.
Hey, we're thinking of heading to the Bronze later.
Wanna come?
Get all unwindy?
Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me.
Nectar of the working man.
- No.
I'll stay here with Dawn.
Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and... listen to the cars honk?
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping over at Janice's.
I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
It's OK.
I checked it out.
Janice's mom is picking her up.
Oh.
I didn't think you'd care.
You're never home, so...
I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'm here now, all visible and everything.
- Can't you stay at Janice's another night?
- Her mom's cooking Mexican.
She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas.
- Not like I knew you'd be around.
Frosty nectar.
Now, please?
- Thank you, baby.
- My pleasure, Master.
That is so cool.
I could've used one of these in high school.
Gentlemen.
To crime.
Crime.
- Crime tastes funny.
- Wow.
I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but...
Wow!
Yeah, she's... really cute.
Cute?
Look at her, men.
The shape of her lips.
The smooth, silky skin.
The way her nose crinkles when she laughs.
She's perfect.
- Yeah.
- She's totally hot.
So are you, Master.
- You think so?
- Oh yes, Master.
OK.
So... how do we...?
- You know?
- Who gets to...?
- I do.
- That's not fair.
- Dude, you didn't call it.
- I don't have to call it.
She's mine.
But don't worry.
You can play with her all you want.
After I'm done with her.
I missed you so much.
You never should have left me.
- Say it.
- I never should have left you, Master.
- Now tell me you love me.
- I love you, Master.
- Again.
- I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
Get on your knees.
Yes, Warren.
Wait.
What'd you just say?
I said "Yes, Warr..."
What the...?
What did you do to me?
!
- Get the dampener!
- Who the hell are you?
- Um, your masters.
- My what?
!
- Where'd you put it?
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Get the dampener!
- You were sharing me with these dorks?
!
Hey!
We're super villains!
- Call us "master".
- Wait!
- Oh, crap.
- It's out of juice.
Is that what you used on me?
Oh, my God!
First the skankbot and now this?
- What is wrong with you?
!
- I wanted us to be together.
There is no us!
Get that through your meaty head.
I am not your girlfriend any more!
- She's your ex?
- Dude, that is messed up.
Oh, you think?
You bunch of little boys playing at being men?
Well, this is not some fantasy.
It's not a game, you freaks!
It's rape!
- What?
- No, we didn't...
You're all sick.
And I'm gonna make sure you get locked up for this.
- Then we'll see how you like getting raped!
- Stop her!
Get off me!
Charge the cerebral dampener.
- Warren...
- Charge the dampener.
Andrew, get her up.
We'll give her another dose.
A stronger one.
Everything's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I don't think so.
She's dead.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Her neck, it just...
No, that's... not...
- This isn't happening.
- I just...
I gotta...
I gotta...
Let me think.
What'd you do?
What the hell did you do?
!
We did this, me and Andrew and you.
It's on all of us.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Shut up!
We have to get...
We have to get rid of it.
How?
Maybe a spell.
Can you teleport it outta here?
No.
She's...
It's too big.
Andrew?
- Andrew?
- What?
Is there anything that you can summon, something that...
something that can devour that much?
Maybe a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater, but they're hard to control.
It'd go for us, too.
Well, that's it, man.
We're screwed.
- Stay calm.
- Tell that to your girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend!
- It doesn't matter.
There's a link.
You knew her, so there's a link.
You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together?
She'll figure it out!
It was an accident.
Maybe we could turn ourselves in.
- No.
- If we go to the police now...
- No.
I'm not going to jail.
- We can't hide this!
Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead!
Well, then maybe it should be sooner.
- Are you insane?
- Listen.
- No!
- Listen!
We have two problems:
the body and the Slayer.
Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both, with one big stone?
What are they doing? We're not gonna have to do that at the wedding?
Cos there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
You're still doing OK, right?
Yeah.
You know, some days are harder than the really hard days.
It's easier like this, though, when I'm not alone.
- I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
- No, that's not...
It's OK.
We know you've been all tied up.
- What?
- With your job and the slaying.
I see sitting where there should be dancing.
- Come share in the joy of our groove thing.
- And despite that, I succumb to the beat.
- I think I'll catch the next soul train out.
- You sure?
Oh, yeah.
You know, glass all the way empty.
More nectar required.
Cool.
Well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricatin'.
You see?
You try to be with them.
But you'll always end up in the dark.
With me.
What would they think of you if they found out... all the things you've done?
If they knew... who you really were?
Don't.
Stop me.
No, don't close your eyes.
Look at them.
That's not your world.
You belong in the shadows.
With me.
Look at your friends, and tell me you don't love getting away with this... right under their noses.
Oh!
I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
The funky monkey claims another victim.
Tara.
What are you doing here?
I mean...
Uh, it's OK for you to be here if you have things that you have to be here for.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
- There's a monkey problem?
- Only if you don't stretch first.
The Brekenkrieg Grimoire?
Light reading?
Yeah.
I was just...
No, it's OK.
I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because...
You don't have to hide it.
I'm not...
I'm doing better.
No spells for 32 days.
I can even go to the magic shop now, as long as someone's with me at all times.
But, uh...
But it's better now.
It really is.
You know, if you were checking on me?
No, I wouldn't...
- I was just looking for Buffy.
- Oh.
Well, I haven't seen her since last night.
She's not around much these days.
We kinda miss her.
I'm sure she feels the same way.
If you see her, can you tell her that I need to talk to her?
It's important.
- Yeah.
Of course I will.
- Thanks.
Will?
I'm...
I'm glad you're doing better.
Don't think about the evil, bloodsucking fiend.
Focus on anything but the evil fiend.
Thank you.
Huh?
It's OK.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you walk?
Are you hurt? What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
Ow!
Bloody hell!
What'd you do that for?
Spike?
Buffy!
Spike.
What's happening?
So you thought you could just slip away, then?
Vampire, remember?
I could feel you.
Ow!
Bloody hell!
What'd you do that for?
Buffy!
Buffy!
Do you mind?
Buffy?
She's dead.
I killed her.
We have to go.
What happened?
There's nothing you can do.
We have to go before someone sees you.
What did I do?
We have to go, now.
All right.
Listen to me.
Buffy.
Buffy!
- She's dead.
- It was an accident.
But I killed her.
- I'm gonna get you home.
- No.
I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm bed and stay there.
I'm gonna sort this out.
Trust me.
Two problems... one stone.
Nice job.
She totally bought it.
Yeah.
Some of my best work.
Uh, what happens now?
The night's young.
Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
We stick to the plan.
Buffy thinks she killed Katrina.
It's her problem now.
What did you do,Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
It's all right, love.
Shh.
All right.
It'll be our little secret.
Do you trust me?
Hey.
What time is it?
It's late.
I just wanna...
I love you.
You know that, right?
What's wrong?
I know I haven't been everything I should be.
Everything Mom was.
But I love you.
I always will.
Why are you talking like this?
Buffy?
There was an accident... in the woods.
A girl... she was hurt.
I hurt someone.
Oh, my God.
Is she all right?
No.
I'm sorry.
There's something I have to do.
I have to tell what I did.
I have to go to the police.
The police?
Dawnie, I have to.
But...
What's going to happen?
I don't know.
They'll take you away, won't they?
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You're never here.
You can't even stand to be around me.
- That's not true.
- You don't wanna be here with me.
You didn't wanna come back.
I know that.
You were happier where you were.
You wanna go away again.
Dawn...
Then go.
You're not really here anyway.
- What do you think you're doing?
- The right thing.
For once.
Sorry, love.
Can't let you do that.
- I have to tell them what happened.
- Nothing happened.
I killed that girl.
Demons in the woods?
Time going wonky?
They won't believe you.
- I'll show them.
- Show them what?
- What did you do?
- I took care of it.
- What did you do?
!
- What I had to.
I went back and I took care of it.
It doesn't matter now.
No one'll ever find her.
- Where'd they find her?
- The river, half a mile from the cemetery.
Oh, balls!
- There is nothing to connect this to you.
- It doesn't matter.
- It wasn't your fault.
- I killed her!
- It was an accident.
It just happened.
- Nothing just happens.
You are not going in there.
I have to do this.
Just let me go.
I can't.
I love you.
No, you don't.
You think I haven't tried not to?
Try harder.
You are not throwing your life away over this.
- It's not your choice.
- Why are you doing this to yourself?
A girl is dead because of me!
How many people are alive because of you?
How many have you saved?
One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
That's all it is to you, isn't it?
Just another body.
Buffy!
You can't understand why this is killing me.
Why don't you explain it?
That's it, put it on me.
Put it all on me.
- That's my girl.
- I am not your girl!
You don't have a soul!
There is nothing good or clean in you.
You are dead inside!
You can't feel anything real!
I could never be your girl!
You always hurt... the one you love, pet.
Buffy?
Buffy.
No, no statements.
Not until I get confirmation.
- Excuse me.
I need to...
- I'll be with you in a sec.
Sunnydale PD?
Yeah.
Phone's ringing off the hook here.
Listen, you got an ID on that body yet?
Yeah?
OK, shoot.
Katrina...
Silber.
S-i-l-b-e-r.
- Warren, tell her to go away.
- I can't.
You're keeping secrets from me - other girls and...
Trina... shut up.
- Warren.
- Thanks.
Now, what's the problem, miss?
- Is this what you saw?
- Yeah, that's it.
Hm.
Rwasundi.
Very rare.
Its presence in our dimension causes a sort of...
localised temporal disturbance.
- So that's why time went all "David Lynch"?
- Right.
Human perception is based on a linear chronology.
Being exposed to the Rwasundi for a few seconds can cause vivid hallucinations.
And a slight tingly scalp.
So that's it.
These things just made you think you killed her.
She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
It wasn't the demon.
It was Warren.
He knew Katrina.
He had something to do with it, I know it.
How can you be sure?
You always hurt the one you love.
Does this mean you're not going away?
Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere.
We need to find Warren and the others.
Whatever they've done, they won't get away with it.
We'll get away with it. "injuries consistent with a fall." The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
What about Buffy?
It wasn't that hard messing her game up.
If she figures it out... we'll take care of her.
We really got away with murder.
That's... kinda cool.
Yeah.
Cool.
- Are you sure?
- I've double-checked everything.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Then why can Spike hurt me?
Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but... you are different.
Shifting you out of... from where you were, funnelling your essence back into your body, it altered you on a basic molecular level.
Probably just enough to confuse the sensors, or whatever, in Spike's chip.
But it's all surfacey physical stuff.
It wouldn't have any more effect than... bad sunburn.
I didn't come back wrong?
No, you're the same Buffy.
With a deep tropical cellular tan.
You must have missed something.
Will you check again?
I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
There has to be.
This just can't be me.
It isn't me.
Why do I feel like this?
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
You mean, hit you?
Oh.
Oh... really?
He's everything I hate.
He's everything that I'm supposed to be against.
But the only time that I ever feel anything is when...
- Don't tell anyone.
Please?
- I won't.
Oh, the way they would look at me!
I just couldn't...
I won't tell anyone.
I wouldn't do that.
Why can't I stop?
Why do I keep letting him in?
Do you love him?
It's OK if you do.
He's done a lot of good, and he does love you.
And, Buffy, it's OK if you don't.
You're going through a really hard time, and you're...
What?
Using him?
What's OK about that?
- It's not that simple.
- It is.
It's wrong.
I'm wrong.
Tell me that I'm wrong, please.
Please don't forgive me.
Please!
God!
Please don't...
Please don't forgive me.
Please don't...
- Previously.
- We screwed it up.
She's just disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
That the kinda demon you are?
I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
So, you three have, what?
Banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch nemesises.
- Dawn, you need to eat.
- Thanks for your concern.
Why is she taking it out on you?
- This isn't gonna work.
- Are you gonna leave me?
- Willow has a problem.
- No more spells.
I'm finished.
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Afraid I'm gonna...?
- Things have changed.
- I'm disgusted with myself.
We missed the bed again.
Lucky for the bed.
Is this a new rug?
No.
Just looks different when you're under it.
You know, this place is OK for a hole in the ground.
You fixed it up.
Well, I ate a decorator once.
Maybe something stuck.
- I've been thinking of changing my room.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I think the New Kids on the Block posters are starting to date me.
Well, if you want, I can...
Are we having a conversation?
What?
No!
No.
Maybe.
What?
Isn't this usually the part where you kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
Thas the plan.
Soon as my legs start working.
You were amazing.
You got the job done yourself.
I was just trying to keep up.
The things you do.
The way you make it hurt in all the wrong places.
I've never been with such an animal.
I'm not an animal.
You wanna see the bite marks?
You know, is late.
I should get home before Dawn goes to sleep.
- And she's off.
- Have you seen my underwear?
What is this to you, this thing we have?
What?
We don't have a...thing.
We have...this.
Thas all.
Do you even like me?
Sometimes.
But you like what I do to you.
Do you trust me?
Never.
How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
Actually living with supervillains was not in the deal.
We're on the lam.
Is not like we have a choice.
This sucks.
Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
Stop whining!
Get your sissy crap out of the way!
Hey, quit it!
Don't you curse me.
Hey, give me my bone!
When you girls are done, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.
Cool.
Got the thing?
Musk gland of a Hombja'moleev demon.
Fresh.
All right.
Stand back.
Doma voluntatem.
Libere cupidinem.
Arumpe ignem.
Excita.
OK.
Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener is on line.
Now, with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave.
I know just where to start.
- Doublemeat is double sweet.
Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- Just something I'm tryin'.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, time has no meaning here.
Gina, I'm takin' a break.
I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
If you close your eyes and smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, ill go away.
Eventually.
I'm hoping.
Thanks for coming by.
Is it bad?
I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
I knew this was gonna happen.
What did Willow do now?
Did she...hurt anyone?
What?
No, no.
Um...
Tara, this isn't about Willow.
I thought thas why you didn't want to meet at the house.
Sorry.
Is...
Willow's fine.
She's been doing really well.
You'd be proud of her.
Good.
Thas good.
So what do you want to talk about?
Is Spike.
He can hurt me... without his head exploding.
Oh, my God.
His chip stopped working?
No.
It still works.
Just not on me.
I need to know about the spell, the one that brought me back.
I...
I'd ask Willow, but...
You think is you.
I don't know.
I feel...different.
There are things that...
I think...maybe...
I came back wrong.
No, Buffy.
Thas not...
No.
You didn't.
Can you check out the spell?
Just see if there's something that...
Could you just check?
Please?
Right there!
Thas got it.
Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
Mad Dog Three to Mad Dog One.
- Signal's strong and clear.
Over.
- Roger that.
Beginning preliminary sweep.
Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer.
I don't want any surprises.
We can really have anyone we want.
- Is like candy.
- Juicy, pulsating candy.
Oh!
The one with the neck.
Put the whammy on the neck!
No.
I want the redhead!
The redheaïs too tall.
- Get off of me!
Jerk!
- Take it back!
- Target acquired.
- What?
Initiating contact.
- The brunette?
- Oh, she's kinda cute.
Ow!
- Oh, no.
Go for the leather skirt!
- Bazoombas!
- Yeah.
Go for the one with the bazoombas.
- Bazoombas.
Bazoombas.
So how did you get so beautiful?
OK.
Does that line usually wor...?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Is nice to see you, too, Katrina.
Is the seeing you thas throwing me.
I thought I was pretty clear I never wanted that to happen again.
- Never's a long time, baby.
- Apparently, not long enough.
You're not still sore about that thing, are you?
What thing would that be, exactly?
The wind- up slut you tinkered together?
Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
OK.
So I've made a few mistakes.
No.
No, I did.
For ever lowering myself to be with a jerk like you.
- No.
Don't say that.
- Well, what did you expect?
To just waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?
No.
I just thought we could talk.
I thought maybe we could work things out.
There is nothing to work out.
What you did was sick.
Just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.
God!
yes, I'm sure.
I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
I'm home!
Who wants to help scrape the grease off my...
- Is there singing?
Are we singing again?
- No.
Just the dancin'.
We're teaching Dawn synchronised dance steps for the wedding reception.
Wanna go for a spin?
I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse.
- Oh.
Rough day?
- Kinda.
You've been goin' at it too hard.
We hardly ever see you.
What with slinging' the Doublemeat and pounding' the big evil.
You are looking a little pounded.
Just around the eyes.
Hey, we're thinking of heading to the Bronze later.
Wanna come?
Get all unwindy?
Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me.
Nectar of the working man.
No.
I'll stay here with Dawn.
Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and... listen to the cars honk?
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping over at Janice's.
I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
Is OK.
I checked it out.
Janice's mom is picking her up.
I didn't think you'd care.
You're never home, so...
I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'm here now, all visible and everything.
- Can't you stay at Janice's another night?
- Her mom's cooking Mexican.
She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas.
Not like I knew you'd be around.
Frosty nectar.
Now, please?
- Thank you, baby.
- My pleasure, Master.
That is so cool.
I coulïve used one of these in high school.
Gentlemen.
To crime.
Crime.
- Crime tastes funny.
- Wow.
I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but...
Wow!
Yeah, she's...really cute.
Cute?
Look at her, men.
The shape of her lips.
The smooth, silky skin.
The way her nose crinkles when she laughs.
She's perfect.
- Yeah.
- She's totally hot.
So are you, Master.
- You think so?
- Oh yes, Master.
OK.
So...how do we...?
- You know?
- Who gets to...?
- I do.
- Thas not fair.
- Dude, you didn't call it.
- I don't have to call it.
She's mine.
But don't worry.
You can play with her all you want.
After I'm done with her.
I missed you so much.
You never should have left me.
- Say it.
- I never should have left you, Master.
- Now tell me you love me.
- I love you, Master.
- Again.
- I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
Get on your knees.
Yes, Warren.
Wait.
Whad you just say?
I said "Yes, Warr..."
What the...?
What did you do to me?
- Get the dampener!
- Who the hell are you?
- Um, your masters.
- My what?
- Where'd you put it?
- Are you kidding me?
- Get the dampener!
- You were sharing me with these dorks?
Hey!
We're supervillains!
- Call us "master".
- Wait!
- Oh, crap.
- Is out of juice.
Is that what you used on me?
Oh, my God!
First the skankbot and now this?
- What is wrong with you?
- I wanted us to be together.
There is no us!
Get that through your meaty head.
I am not your girlfriend any more!
- She's your ex?
- Dude, that is messed up.
Oh, you think?
You bunch of little boys playing at being men?
Well, this is not some fantasy.
Is not a game, you freaks!
Is rape!
- What?
- No, we didn't...
You're all sick.
And I'm gonna make sure you get locked up for this.
- Then we'll see how you like getting raped!
- Stop her!
Get off me!
Charge the cerebral dampener.
- Warren...
- Charge the dampener.
Andrew, get her up.
We'll give her another dose.
A stronger one.
Everything's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I don't think so.
She's dead.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Her neck, it just...
No, thas...not...
- This isn't happening.
- I just...
I gotta...
I gotta...
Let me think.
Whad you do?
What the hell did you do?
We did this, me and Andrew and you.
Is on all of us.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Shut up!
We have to get...
We have to get rid of it.
How?
Maybe a spell.
Can you teleport it outta here?
No.
She's...
Is too big.
Andrew?
- Andrew?
- What?
Is there anything that you can summon, something that...
Something that can devour that much?
Maybe a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater, but they're hard to control.
Id go for us, too.
Well, thas it, man.
We're screwed.
- Stay calm.
- Tell that to your girlfriend.
- EX- girlfriend!
- It doesn't matter.
There's a link.
You knew her, so there's a link.
You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together?
She'll figure it out!
It was an accident.
Maybe we could turn ourselves in.
- No.
- If we go to the police now...
- No.
I'm not going to jail.
- We can't hide this!
Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead!
Well, then maybe it should be sooner.
- Are you insane?
- Listen.
- No!
- Listen!
We have two problems.
the body and the Slayer.
Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both, with one big stone?
What are they doing?
We're not gonna have to do that at the wedding?
Cos there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
You're still doing OK, right?
Yeah.
You know, some days are harder than the really hard days.
Is easier like this, though, when I'm not alone.
- I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
- No, thas not...
Is OK.
We know you've been all tied up.
- What?
- With your job and the slaying.
I see sitting where there should be dancing.
- Come share in the joy of our groove thing.
- And despite that, I succumb to the beat.
- I think I'll catch the next soul train out.
- You sure?
Oh, yeah.
You know, glass all the way empty.
More nectar required.
Cool.
Well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricatin'.
You see?
You try to be with them.
But you'll always end up in the dark.
With me.
What would they think of you if they found out...all the things you've done?
If they knew...who you really were?
Don't.
Stop me.
No, don't close your eyes.
Look at them.
Thas not your world.
You belong in the shadows.
With me.
Look at your friends, and tell me you don't love getting away with this... right under their noses.
Oh!
I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
The funky monkey claims another victim.
Tara.
What are you doing here?
I mean...
Uh, is OK for you to be here if you have things that you have to be here for.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
- There's a monkey problem?
- Only if you don't stretch first.
The Brekenkrieg Grimoire?
Light reading?
Yeah.
I was just...
No, is OK.
I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because...
You don't have to hide it.
I'm not...
I'm doing better.
No spells for 32 days.
I can even go to the magic shop now, as long as someone's with me at all times.
But, uh...
But is better now.
It really is.
You know, if you were checking on me?
No, I wouldn't...
I was just looking for Buffy.
Well, I haven't seen her since last night.
She's not around much these days.
We kinda miss her.
I'm sure she feels the same way.
If you see her, can you tell her that I need to talk to her?
Is important.
- Yeah.
Of course I will.
- Thanks.
Will?
I'm...
I'm glad you're doing better.
Don't think about the evil, bloodsucking fiend.
Focus on anything but the evil fiend.
Thank you.
Huh?
Is OK.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you walk?
Are you hurt?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
Ow!
Bloody hell!
Whad you do that for?
Spike?
Buffy!
Spike.
Whas happening?
So you thought you could just slip away, then?
Vampire, remember?
I could feel you.
Ow!
Bloody hell!
Whad you do that for?
Buffy!
Buffy!
Do you mind?
Buffy?
She's dead.
I killed her.
We have to go.
What happened?
There's nothing you can do.
We have to go before someone sees you.
What did I do?
We have to go, now.
All right.
Listen to me.
Buffy.
Buffy!
- She's dead.
- It was an accident.
But I killed her.
- I'm gonna get you home.
- No.
I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm bed and stay there.
I'm gonna sort this out.
Trust me.
Two problems...one stone.
Nice job.
She totally bought it.
Yeah.
Some of my best work.
Uh, what happens now?
The nighs young.
Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
We stick to the plan.
Buffy thinks she killed Katrina.
Is her problem now.
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
Is all right, love.
All right.
Ill be our little secret.
Do you trust me?
Hey.
What time is it?
Is late.
I just wanna...
I love you.
You know that, right?
Whas wrong?
I know I haven't been everything I should be.
Everything Mom was.
But I love you.
I always will.
Why are you talking like this?
Buffy?
There was an accident...in the woods.
A girl...she was hurt.
I hurt someone.
Oh, my God.
Is she all right?
No.
I'm sorry.
There's something I have to do.
I have to tell what I did.
I have to go to the police.
The police?
Dawnie, I have to.
But...
Whas going to happen?
I don't know.
They'll take you away, won't they?
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You're never here.
You can't even stand to be around me.
- Thas not true.
- You don't wanna be here with me.
You didn't wanna come back.
I know that.
You were happier where you were.
You wanna go away again.
Dawn...
Then go.
You're not really here anyway.
- What do you think you're doing?
- The right thing.
For once.
Sorry, love.
Can't let you do that.
- I have to tell them what happened.
- Nothing happened.
I killed that girl.
Demons in the woods?
Time going wonky?
They won't believe you.
- I'll show them.
- Show them what?
- What did you do?
- I took care of it.
- What did you do?
- What I had to.
I went back and I took care of it.
It doesn't matter now.
No one'll ever find her.
- Where'd they find her?
- The river, half a mile from the cemetery.
Oh, balls!
- There is nothing to connect this to you.
- It doesn't matter.
- It wasn't your fault.
- I killed her!
- It was an accident.
It just happened.
- Nothing just happens.
You are not going in there.
I have to do this.
Just let me go.
I can't.
I love you.
No, you don't.
You think I haven't tried not to?
Try harder.
You are not throwing your life away over this.
- Is not your choice.
- Why are you doing this to yourself?
A girl is dead because of me!
How many people are alive because of you?
How many have you saved?
One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
Thas all it is to you, isn't it?
Just another body.
Buffy!
You can't understand why this is killing me.
Why don't you explain it?
Thas it, put it on me.
Put it all on me.
- Thas my girl.
- I am not your girl!
You don't have a soul!
There is nothing good or clean in you.
You are dead inside!
You can't feel anything real!
I could never be your girl!
You always hurt...the one you love, pet.
Buffy?
Buffy.
No, no statements.
Not until I get confirmation.
- Excuse me.
I need to...
- I'll be with you in a sec.
Sunnydale PD?
Yeah.
Phone's ringing off the hook here.
Listen, you got an ID on that body yet?
Yeah?
OK, shoot.
Katrina...
Silber.
S- i- l- b- e- r.
- Warren, tell her to go away.
- I can't.
You're keeping secrets from me - other girls and...
Trina...shut up.
- Warren.
- Thanks.
Now, whas the problem, miss?
- Is this what you saw?
- Yeah, thas it.
Hm.
Rwasundi.
Very rare.
Its presence in our dimension causes a sort of...
localised temporal disturbance.
- So thas why time went all "David Lynch"?
- Right.
Human perception is based on a linear chronology.
Being exposed to the Rwasundi for a few seconds can cause vivid hallucinations.
And a slight tingly scalp.
So thas it.
These things just made you think you killed her.
She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
It wasn't the demon.
It was Warren.
He knew Katrina.
He had something to do with it, I know it.
How can you be sure?
You always hurt the one you love.
Does this mean you're not going away?
Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere.
We need to find Warren and the others.
Whatever they've done, they won't get away with it.
We'll get away with it."Injuries consistent with a fall." The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
What about Buffy?
It wasn't that hard messing her game up.
If she figures it out...we'll take care of her.
We really got away with murder.
Thas...kinda cool.
Yeah.
Cool.
- Are you sure?
- I've double- checked everything.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Then why can Spike hurt me?
Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but...you are different.
Shifting you out of...from where you were, funnelling your essence back into your body, it altered you on a basic molecular level.
Probably just enough to confuse the sensors, or whatever, in Spike's chip.
But is all surfacey physical stuff.
It wouldn't have any more effect than...bad sunburn.
I didn't come back wrong?
No, you're the same Buffy.
With a deep tropical cellular tan.
You must have missed something.
Will you check again?
I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
There has to be.
This just can't be me.
It isn't me.
Why do I feel like this?
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
You mean, hit you?
Oh...really?
He's everything I hate.
He's everything that I'm supposed to be against.
But the only time that I ever feel anything is when...
- Don't tell anyone.
Please?
- I won't.
Oh, the way they would look at me!
I just couldn't...
I won't tell anyone.
I wouldn't do that.
Why can't I stop?
Why do I keep letting him in?
Do you love him?
Is OK if you do.
He's done a lot of good, and he does love you.
And, Buffy, is OK if you don't.
You're going through a really hard time, and you're...
What?
Using him?
Whas OK about that?
- Is not that simple.
- It is.
Is wrong.
I'm wrong.
Tell me that I'm wrong, please.
Please don't forgive me.
Please!
God!
Please don't...
Please don't forgive me.
Please don't...
Previously on Alias.
SD-6 has nothing to do with the CIA.
Dixon, you've been lied to.
- What do you...
- SD-6 is part of the Alliance!
You have been working for the enemy you thought you were fighting
We've gotten reports now from all team leaders.
We appear to be in control of all Alliance facilities.
Look, this will be over soon.
I promise.
Don't talk to me.
You're so beautiful.
Dinner's ready.
You do have an oven, you know.
We can reheat it.
How are we gonna stay awake today?
How come you never call me Michael?
I do sometimes.
Vaughn?
What?
I'm graduating today.
What?
When the hell did you have time to take a class this year?
I wasn't even going to go to the ceremony but...
And I've been lying here remembering why I never gave school up...
And why I killed myself writing papers instead of...
I don't know.
Accepting that I'd be an agent forever.
You're going to quit the CIA, aren't you?
I'm afraid I can't endorse your resignation.
Excuse me?
Well, with the Alliance gone, we got a hell of a mess to clean up.
- You don't need me for that.
- Well, that's opinion.
And what about Arvin Sloane, whom I think you would have a special interest in bringing to justice?
Sloane is just a cog in a machine that doesn't exist anymore.
He's wanted in forty countries.
I did everything for the CIA I said I would, and I'm done.
Jack, you want to jump in here?
For years, I wanted nothing more than to see you live a normal life.
However, your value to the CIA is irrefutable.
So while this is ultimately your choice, I suggest... that given the enormity of the last two weeks, you may not want to make life-altering decisions without a little more perspective.
I've had two years of perspective!
I am through letting Arvin Sloane control my life and I don't need your approval to resign!
I told you as a courtesy!
Well, then, I will pay you the courtesy of informing you that if you leave this agency, you forfeit the clearance to see your mother.
What, are you blackmailing me?
Civilians aren't authorized to be in this facility, let alone have access to a terrorist we can't even acknowledge is in our custody!
In or out, kiddo?
Can't have it both ways.
Legally, he's right.
Ethically, he's an ass.
Congratulations.
Your father told me about your success.
What about your associates at SD-6?
You had friends there, yes?
I haven't seen them yet.
I mean, they're still being debriefed.
I'm sorry that I haven't been to see you in a while.
Well, I understand.
I'm sure this has been overwhelming for you.
- I graduate today.
- I know.
I would think you'd be more relieved with SD-6 and the Alliance gone.
I'm thinking about leaving the CIA.
Which would mean giving up my clearance to see you.
You're too forgiving, Sydney.
Don't pretend I'm something I'm not.
I've never been a real mother to you and... you don't owe me a second chance.
If you make this decision about me, you're a fool.
In fact, if you decide to stay I won't agree to see you anymore.
Take care of yourself.
- Aaron!
Aaron!
Don't run!
- I just want to go back to the jellyfish!
Okay.
Always make sure we can see you, okay?
And hold on to your jacket, Aaron!
- Okay, so you're going to stay here, right?
- Yes.
- You're gonna stay here?
- Yeah!
I'll be right over there with your daddy, okay?
- Where are you?
- Here.
I'm here.
Neil, it's Aaron's birthday.
Your head's still at the blackboard.
Honey...
I-I just...
I need two more months, that's it.
I-I am this close.
I can't stand any more promises you don't keep!
- I don't know how else to do this!
- Maybe you don't.
There are other fields.
Once the polytechnic goes public with the design, I'll slow down.
I mean, I'll stop.
I promise.
Think about your father.
Aaron's growing up, and you're missing it.
Where is he?
Excuse me, did you see a little boy?
He's five-years-old, he's got a striped shirt on, he's got brown hair, his name is Aaron.
No.
I'm sorry.
I'll check the gift shop.
Mr. Caplan.
I believe I can help you locate your son.
And your wife.
Seriously?
Oh, my God.
Francie, what?
Earrings, necklace?
What do I need?
Let's see...
You look beautiful.
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you.
What's a four-letter word for "ice cream thickener"?
Agar.
A-G-A-R.
Hello?
Just a minute.
- How'd you know that?
- Phone for you.
Hello?
Congratulations, Sydney.
You have so many things to celebrate today.
I, myself, am still coping with the pain and disappointment of learning that you and Jack were double agents.
The two people I trusted most in the world.
How many "S"s in "Massachusetts"?
Oh, sorry.
Our first honest conversation, Sydney, and you have nothing to say?
Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
You have been a plague on my life.
You repulse me!
Every time I sat across from you, listening to your lies, all I could do was fantasize about slashing your throat!
Well, I can't pretend to be surprised that you feel that way.
My only hope is that you can learn to forgive me.
As hurt as I am, I know I can forgive you.
After all, Sydney, I helped you.
What are you talking about?
You don't really think it was a coincidence that I happened to be away these past two weeks, do you?
The intel that you acquired that allowed the CIA to take down the Alliance...
I provided that.
My involvement with the Alliance is merely a means to an end.
Why are you telling me this?
Because knowing that I'm alive is going to tempt you to come after me.
Don't.
We've helped set each other free, Sydney.
And as much as I wish you well, I will end your life if you get in my way.
He called me at home.
To warn me.
No matter where he is, I can be gotten to.
Unfortunately, you're not the only one.
Neil Caplan.
He's a mathematecian working out of Cal Tech.
The bureau just confirmed that he and his family were kidnapped from the Long Beach Aquarium yesterday.
Parking lot surveillance cameras recorded this.
Doubtful he's acting alone.
I assume his partnership with Sloane is alive and well.
What do they want with a mathematician?
He specializes in a branch of mathematics called knot theory.
Knot as in tie a knot?
Simply put, it's the study of geometric objects and how they fit together.
All Alliance facilities have been raided yet we haven't found a single Rambaldi artifact.
If Sloane was expecting our raid, he could've had everything moved to a secure location.
He must be using Caplan to help him assemble a Rambaldi device.
So what happens when Sloane puts the pieces together?
Whether or not you believe Rambaldi was a prophet, he did anticipate technological advances, many of which seem most applicable to warfare.
It's likely Sloane is building a weapon.
He planned for this.
He wanted the Alliance gone.
And this family that he's taken hostage, they aren't the only people whose lives he'll destroy.
This is never going to stop.
Your resignation form.
Sign it, and you're out.
Your glasses.
Mr. Caplan, my name is Arvin Sloane.
Where's my family?
They're alive.
And if you cooperate, you'll be reunited soon enough.
Where am I?
Years ago, I was with the army corps of engineering.
They wanted me to study this.
That manuscript is 500-years-old.
Those sketches were drawn by a man named Milo Rambaldi.
You will see that Rambaldi prophesied scientific principles centuries ahead of his time.
Protoypes of his designs have turned up all over the world.
For the past thirty years, I've been collecting them.
I don't understand.
Why do you want me?
I'm nobody.
You're going to help me put them together because, you see, Mr. Caplan,
I know that you feel like you're only a hostage right now.
But I assume you became a scientist to discover what secrets the universe has to offer.
Believe me, when we're done here, you'll be thanking me for giving you the answer.
So why don't you go ahead and take a look?
I wanted to be the one to come in and tell you officially that you've been cleared.
The CIA has concluded that you had no knowledge of what was really going on at SD-6.
They want to offer you a place here.
Dixon, you have to know that you were my anchor.
Your friendship was the only thing that kept me sane.
How long have you known?
Two years.
I wanted to tell you so many times, but I was ordered not to.
The CIA had no way to verify what I knew in my heart was true that you would never consider working for a man like Arvin Sloane.
We were partners.
You lied to me, then chose to tell me the truth when it was convenient for you.
I never want to see you again.
Okay!
I'll need taps into all gov networks -
- NSA, DOD, FBI, CIA.
Oh, I'll need a red phone to the president.
- No.
- That's all right, I just thought I'd ask.
I'll need a cryogen air prototype rig.
Don't worry,
I'll put my own baffles on the heat sync so it won't be too loud.
Marshall.
I'm Michael Vaughn.
- Welcome to the CIA.
- Heard that one before.
Well, this time it's for real.
We have a desk set up for you.
You okay?
Yeah, I mean, every few minutes I have to fight the urge to weep openly.
I'm not really sure where that's coming from yet but I think that's healthy, right?
Listen, I know you need time to adjust but we could really use your help with something.
Look, we're trying to find Sloane but we can't access any information from his computer.
Well, he probably erased everything from his hard drive before he left and the deletion program
I installed last year exceeded DOD sanitizing standards 'cause, you know, I thought I was working for the government!
You know the story because you also thought you were working for...
I mean, you actually were working for the government and we didn't really know but that's okay.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey, baby.
Got your message, sorry your business trip was delayed.
- Where are the kids?
- At the park with Mandy.
Glad the bank at least gave you the rest of the day off.
Diane.
We need to talk.
What is it?
Is it your mother?
No.
I don't work at a bank.
I never have.
Well, I was able to recover a few fragments from the RAM drive on Sloane's database.
One of them was the most recent doc he was working on.
It's a digital rolodex.
Now, he checked one address in it.
Holden Gendler, Van Nuys.
Guy's a cybernetic specialist.
I'll go.
Okay, um, now, usually redeye is a photographic effect caused by light reflecting in the pupil, but in Holden Gendler's case?
It was caused by this.
It's an intra-ocular retinal implant.
- You care to elaborate?
- Yeah, of course, Mr. Ken...
Director.
Cause you're the Director Kendall.
Right.
Um, that's one L?
- Two.
- It's two.
Of course.
Why would it... by the way, sir, this place?
So much cooler than SD-6.
- How about the point?
- Of course.
Sorry.
So, basically this guy Gendler, he was blind in his left eye so he used himself as a guinea pig for wetware experiments, interfacing technology with the human brain.
Real cutting edge.
Basically this implant connects with the optical nerve which sends impulses to the vision center in his brain.
What did Sloane want with a wetware expert?
All Alliance members were injected with a tracking device.
Sloane must've hired Gendler to deactivate his so he could disappear.
Right.
But there's more.
Now, this little baby records everything it sees on an internal memory.
Now the LED light was blinking because it was full so I was able to download twelve hours of footage.
Now there was no audio so I created a lip reading program.
Just whipped it up.
No extra charge.
And, uh, take a look at what I found.
This is the last thing Gendler saw.
Mr. Sloane...
It's Sloane.
I've chartered a C-123 out of Shipman to transport the artifacts.
I will be in touch.
"Shipman" could refer to the airfield in the Mojave desert.
We've surveilled it before.
It's operated by a transatlantic smuggling cartel.
Ex-military, dishonorably discharged after the Gulf war.
They're well-armed, highly organized.
And they do have a C-123 in their fleet.
I could have a tactical team there in three hours.
Once these guys understand their legal options, they'll be inclined to tell us where Sloane went.
Interrogating the employees could take days.
And Sloane doesn't just let hostages go when he's done with them.
I'm open to suggestions.
If we could get into the facility undetected and access the flight data recorder on the plane Sloane chartered, we could track him directly to his last destination.
Spoken like a true volunteer.
I'm hungry.
Where's my husband?
Your husband is a gifted individual.
And we need his assistance for a short while.
Should he choose to cooperate, this will soon be an unpleasant memory.
We'd like for you to tell your husband that you support his cooperation and if he doesn't, your son will be the first to suffer.
Oh, God...
So, Mr. Johnson, I need these shipped to Beijing by tomorrow.
You know what I find most interesting, Mr. Ludlow?
Is that for an accomplished arms merchant, I've never heard your name.
Now if you're really an expert, you'll know what kind of gun is pointed at the back of your head by the sound of the hammer.
An M19-11.
But if he were really going to shoot me, he would have disengaged the thumb safety.
I got a charter leaving for Asia in a half an hour.
If the money and the delivery instructions are in that briefcase as we discussed, it's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Good call on the gun.
I would've said Beretta M-9.
Figured I had a 50/50 chance.
Found the AFT access plane, I'm looking for the flight data recorder.
Found it!
Attaching the disk imager.
Receiving uplink now.
Uplink complete, get out of there.
What are you doing here?
I don't have a work order in this aircraft.
Give me your ID, I'm calling this in.
Tower, I need confirmation--
Vaughn, I've been made!
- Meet me at the northwest hangar!
- Copy that, I'm on my way!
Get in!
GO!
Where did you stay last night?
At my sister's.
The kids are there.
The time you were shot, you told me that you had been mugged.
If you had died that day, I would have buried a stranger.
Look, I don't know if a single word you have ever said to me was true!
My love for you is true.
My love for our children is true.
As a husband, as a father...
I couldn't honestly say I was protecting my family unless I was out there!
Except that you were working for the people that make the world more dangerous.
I thought I was serving our country.
This man, Sloane...
I will never lie to you again.
The CIA's offered me a job.
Marcus, I did not choose a life of wondering whether my husband was coming home every night.
You take that job, you take it alone.
Will you help us?
You want me to help you?
You let my family go.
That is the only way!
No.
That is not the only way.
Help them, honey.
Do what they want, please, or they're going to hurt Aaron...
You want me to help you put this thing together.
Are you telling me that these pieces exist?
You're sitting in a warehouse full of them.
According to this, each artifact is generating its own unique magnetic field.
These fields determine where in the overall design the pieces go.
The problem is, there's no room for error in the calculations and the equipment you gave me isn't sensitive enough for me to measure the fields with perfect accuracy.
I need something I don't have!
The magnetometer you're developing for the Swiss polytechnic.
- How do you know about that?
- I know about a lot of things.
You're asking me to do something I cannot do.
The magnetometer was designed to measure magnetic fields in space.
It would be sensitive enough to do this kind of work but until it's cleared patent, the polytechnics have got it locked up in a vault somewhere.
The Amcorp bank.
It's two miles from here.
We're in Switzerland?
By tomorrow, you'll have what you need.
Just a few more days, Emily.
Well, I'm still waiting for the owner to counter.
Yeah, of course it has a garden.
As a matter of fact, I'm looking out the window at the garden right now.
Yes.
I miss you too, my love.
What happens when your wife's ready to move to her Tuscan villa?
I purchased it six months ago.
I made contact with our point man.
He's assembling a team for the bank but I must question your decision to lead them in yourself.
In spite of your precautions, it's wildly risky, given your new level of notoreity.
I'm approaching the finish line of a thirty-year odyssey.
I won't let anyone else take the final steps for me.
This is the flight plan we retrieved from the plane's data recorders.
Sloane left Shimpan for an island off the coast of Bermuda.
We're sending in a team but it's doubtful he's still there because the plane then went on to the Zurich airport in Switzerland.
It's a start, but he could be anywhere by now.
Unless we assume Sloane went to Switzerland for a reason, that he isn't merely passing through, in that case we can expect him to hire local support, mercenaries.
I dealt with a guy in Switzerland.
A headhunter we once used to put a black ops team together in western Europe.
He controls most of the local territory.
Sloane would use him if he needed mercs.
Well, assuming he did, if this guy knows your CIA he could tip Sloane off.
He doesn't.
We hired him fronting as a French crime syndicate.
Set up a meet.
You two are on a plane.
The bank's facial recognition cameras will measure my underlying bone structure.
The cameras target the distance between your cheekbones.
The prosthetics I'll apply are lined with a carbon powder.
The system's data won't find a match.
Even an X-ray would be fooled.
Well, then, let's begin.
I'm not French.
I'm CIA.
We've tolerated your existence because you've been helpful but that tolerance can end now.
We have reason to believe one of these men recently approached you to hire some of your contacts.
Warm or cold?
If you had told me the CIA was simply interested in my client list,
I would have told you to go make love... with your mother.
Hands!
Ahhh, you broke my...
- Tell me if they came to see you!
- You broke my nose!
- TALK TO ME!
- Okay, okay, they came!
They hired some men!
- For what?
- I don't know the details!
- Tell me what you know!
- The woman and the child...
I know where they are!
- Where?
!
- In the other room, downstairs!
They're here?
It's okay!
We're CIA agents, you're safe.
- It's okay, buddy.
- You're safe, come on.
Oh, God!
Where's my husband?
We're still looking for him.
We're doing everything we can.
- What's your name?
- Sydney.
Sydney Bristow.
Thank you, Sydney.
Syd, one of the guys had a cell phone.
If either Sark or Sloane called directly, we can trace him.
We still don't get how you detected the tap we put on the SD-6 network last year.
Yes, that was a noble attempt, gentleman, a noble attempt.
But, uh, you see, what happened was it was interfering with my online Dungeon Master game.
My gnome kept skipping a frame every time he swung his battle ax, so...
Oh, my God.
My first phone call.
Excuse me.
Yeah, this is Marshall?
Marshall, it's me.
I need you to run a location trace on every incoming call that was made to the phone I'm talking to you on.
Sure, Syd, no problem.
Okay, I need you to scroll to the incoming call menu on the phone and then hit #, #, and then send.
Okay, hold on.
I'm getting fifteen locations.
Any of them in Zurich?
Uh, two.
The first one was made from a payphone at the Zurich airport.
No good.
Next!
Made from a cell phone.
I can probably triangulate the location if it's on.
I got it!
It's moving.
Where is it?
Looks like the Amcorp bank on Newmarket Street.
I'll call you right back.
We're going to Newmarket Street.
- Marshall, we're heading south on Burgstrasse!
- The robbery is in progress!
Burgstrasse!
Are you copying my signal?
Yeah, yeah, I got you.
Make a right at the next light!
Hold on!
Mr. Skopic, welcome.
I'm Claude Shyer, president of Amcorp bank.
We spoke on the phone.
Ah, yes.
Thank you for accomodating me on such short notice.
Not at all.
Fifty million dollars in cash is not the kind of thing one likes to leave under one's pillow for very long.
This is our bank manager, Peter Kuntz.
- Hello.
- Pleasure.
He will take you to our vault while I secure your deposit.
Good.
Can I offer you anything?
An espresso?
Oh, thank you very much, most kind.
But due to a sensitive stomach my physician has prohibited caffeine from my diet.
Very well.
After you.
I've spliced into the facial registration database.
You've cleared their system.
I'll need ten seconds.
Keep him talking a bit longer.
Herr Kuntz, let me ask you something.
This American war on terrorism, has it affected your procedure in any way at all?
Looping the feed... now.
I assure you, our institution is one of the most safest in the world.
Box 4747!
Okay, take a left into the alley!
I guess it's pointless to say we should wait for backup?
Sydney, you're going too fast!
SYDNEY!
Who's in charge?
What can I do for you?
We're United States agents.
Lockdown your vault, you're being robbed.
I think you're mistaken.
It's looped.
That's him.
Sydney's in the lobby!
She's by the entrance!
Hold your fire!
Get down!
I warned you, Sydney.
I can't guarantee your safety in a situation like this.
There's no way I'm letting you walk out of here!
Ah... you must be the man that Sark told me about.
The man that Sydney was willing to kill me for.
She would have killed you for a lot less.
The police are on their way.
We have Caplan's family.
Give up!
We've rigged the lower level with enough C-4 to level the entire city block so if we don't walk out of here... nobody does.
You're bluffing.
I'm not the only one carrying a remote trigger.
The entire bank is monitored via satellite by an off-site team.
If they don't see me walk out of here in thirty seconds, they'll detonate.
So I suggest that you both lower your guns.
Lower... your guns.
Toss them on the ground.
And you, my dear... you'll be driving me out of here.
Your mother's trial starts this morning.
How long do you think it'll last?
Could be a while.
With eighty-six counts of espionage against her, the prosecution alone could take months just to present their case.
I want to see the opening arguments.
I'll arrange for a closed-circuit feed into the ops center.
Thanks.
You know any jokes?
'Cause I could use one.
This grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says,
"Hey, we have a drink named after you!" And the grasshopper says--
"You have a drink named Doug?"
Well, I was going to use Phil.
Well, Phil is certainly no funnier than Doug.
No, I know, I'm sorry.
It's a non-humorous, uh...
Mr. Sark.
As you know, he's proven himself to be a key player in the world of international organized crime.
Now he may be developing a bioweapon systemized form a virus that we've never seen before.
This is Klaus Richter, a former employee of Sark's whom we've recently taken into custody.
A routine medical workup revealed that Richter may have been exposed to the virus before we picked him up.
Marshall?
Thank you, sir.
Okay, now, take a look on your screen here.
These little squiggly things -- that's just a normal flue anti-body, something that you might have if you got a common cold, or cough, something.
Now let's take a look at Richter's blood work.
Now this shows antibodies one thousand per cent above normal levels.
Very similiar to the Ebola virus, most notably massive hemorrhaging.
Except that this virus works by breaking down bonds between cells, so basically Richter's body in just a couple of days is gonna look oooh like, well, did you ever see that movie "The Fly"?
Do you remember that little poor red-assed baboon when he was, like, turned inside out?
Thank you, Marshall.
We recently uncovered a charter agreement indicating that Sark rented a medically equipped 727 to transport three patients presumably suffering from the same virus as Richter to a private hospital in Geneva.
This hospital is one of Sark's business fronts.
We believe he's assembled a team to study the virus.
Your objective is to infiltrate the facility and acquire the research.
Jack, you'll be entering the hospital as a patient in need of a kidney transplant.
Sydney, you'll be accompanying him as the loving daughter who's agreed to donate one.
I trust this one won't be too much of a stretch, hmmm, for either of you?
We should talk.
We have nothing to talk about.
I know you have questions.
You can either be angry, or you can be informed.
Please try to understand what I'm about to tell you, Sydney.
After your mother left, I tested Project Christmas on you because I didn't want you to be a victim.
I thought it was my responsibility to teach you how to think strategically, to see through people's lies, to be as strong as you could be in an environment where one mistake could cost you your life.
Then you should've told me the truth before I ended up here.
Yes, you're right!
I never intended you to lead a double life.
I imagined recruiting you into the CIA after you finished college.
But Sloane got to you first, and that is a mistake I will never live down.
I'd like to believe you, but I don't trust anything you say.
Closed-circuit's online, the proceeding start in about a minute.
And the feed will be right over here.
Thanks, Rick.
Sure.
That's Senator Douglas.
Where's the judge?
Distiguished witnesses, I know you were expecting opening arguments for the prosecution of Irina Derevko, but as of this morning a plea agreement has been reached with the defendant.
In regard to the eighty-six counts of espionage leading to the deaths of twelve United States operatives, Derevko has pled guilty on all counts.
A select penalty jury was empanelled early this morning and the decision was predictably swift.
Derevko received the maximum sentence under federal statute -- death by lethal injection.
Since she's opted to forego all appeals, the execution will be carried out three days from today.
Session adjourned.
Confidential to Deputy Director Devlin.
I'm writing to inform you that my father,
Jack Bristow, did willfully deceive the CIA into believing Irina Derevko violated her immunity agreement.
I'm committing this statement to paper so it may be used in an officiial capacity to halt my mother's execution.
Despite her past crime, I can't in good conscience allow her sentence to be carried out when she kept her word to cooperate with us.
It is not Irina Derevko who should be answering to these charges.
It is my father.
We have a dead drop.
Request pick up.
Looks like a letter.
Copy that.
Sending agent for retrieval.
When my mom first came back, I wanted her dead.
How the hell did I become the person who's trying to save her?
That doesn't mean that you have to be her best friend.
It means that you did the right thing.
(smiles) How are you?
Oh, I got my, uh, thirty days sobriety chip.
Even though I wasn't ever a drug addict, I'm kind of proud.
Oh, by the way, you know anybody who wants a car?
I'm hocking mine.
You're selling your car?
Yeah, well, it's either that or I quit paying my student loans.
I can't afford to have bad credit and a criminal record.
Well, I know you're going to say no but I can lend you money.
Yes, I'm gonna say no.
But thank you.
Hey.
In the morning, I got rear-ended by four frat guys coming home from a party.
Two of them threw up while I was getting their insurance information.
At least they had insurance.
Why are you cleaning like this?
You're acting like Howard Hughes.
Well, the Zagat guy is coming to give his review today.
I want this place spotless.
There's a hamburger behind you.
You know, Francie, I worked up through Los Feliz and Atwater Village.
Oh, cool, Cliff, thanks.
Give me just a second?
Okay, I told him I'd give him a couple bucks if he just handed out some fliers, got the word out.
Hamburgers aren't on the menu, are they?
Garden burger.
How much are you paying that guy?
Twelve bucks an hour.
Hamburger's making more than I am.
Keep cleaning, sweetie.
I gotta clean.
I gotta catch a plane.
Be safe.
Okay.
Sir, if you'll recall Project Christmas was developed by Jack Bristow to train potential CIA recruits at a young age.
Now, based on the research Irina Derevko stole from him, the KGB developed their own version of the project.
Yes, I recall.
One of our assets in Moscow just sent this over.
It's a test questionnaire administered to a group of first graders in the early eighties.
The test was designed to identify kids who would make good agents in the Soviet secret service.
Reading over it, what really struck me is how similiar these questions are to a standard IQ test given to first graders in this country.
Where are you going with this?
Remember the rumour going around the agency around the Cold War about the Soviets raising sleeper agents as Americans?
Now, I know it sounds potentially paranoid, but this is how they would do it if they managed to get their test in circulation here.
They could have contacted hundreds of kids.
Interesting, but unlikely.
I just think it would be intersting to analyze tests from--
Stop.
We can't spare a single agent right now, much less a team for a project that at best has historical value.
The KGB doesn't even exist anymore!
I see your mother's latest maneuver had its intended effect on you.
What maneuver would that be?
Pleading guilty, accepting the death penalty.
Yep.
She's got us right where she wants us.
Not us.
You.
Your mother's no fool.
She must have deduced I set her up, so why do you imagine she pled guilty?
Because she was struck by a crisis of conscience?
I think she knew the verdict was a foregone conclusion.
She pled guilty to keep you from witnessing her trial, Sydney, from having you see photos of the agents she savagely murdered, including Vaughn's father.
She knew if you sat through that, whatever sympathy she'd managed to elicit from you would vanish, so she cast herself as the victim to compel you to save her and guess what?
You fell for it.
I thought you deserved a second chance to think things over.
Here's your letter.
How'd you get that?
I spent a decade with this woman and another twenty years analyzing how she could have deceived me for so long.
Trust me when I tell you, I am protecting you.
No, you're not.
I think you loved Mom so much that when she left you, you lost your soul.
You know what else I think?
I think the kind of man who'd use his own daughter to frame her mother, who'd test psych experiments when she was six-years-old is the kind of man who looks at his daughter and sees his greatest mistake.
You can't honestly believe that.
It's true, isn't it?
If Mom hadn't fooled you, if you hadn't been so gullible, I never would have been born.
I'm going to finish reviewing the mission now.
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.
Of course.
Is everything all right?
Okay, look, I don't -
- I don't know how to say this other than to just say it.
I need a job.
With all the publicity, no one will hire me.
I thought maybe you could help me out.
I mean,
I don't mean to be an agent.
I know the CIA has a ton of front companies -- defense contractors, shipping companies.
I'll work at a desk, anywhere, just as long--
Look, I know this will drive you insane, but we can't employ you because you have a criminal record.
I have a criminal record because of a drug habit I never had.
You know anybody who wants to buy a car?
There might be something.
I have a discretionary fund used for informants.
Totally off the books.
I could pay you to do research.
Seriously?
Man, I would so owe you.
This is a list of questions, please keep them to yourself.
All I need you to do is find out if any of these questions ever appeared on a standardized test in the United States over the last twenty years.
Okay, the more you tell me the faster I can get you what you want, so--
I pay by the hour.
Take your time.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Mr. Harris, I'm Jan Spinnaker, hospital administrator.
Welcome to St. Auburn's.
My daughter, and the very twinkle of my eye -
- Marion.
Daddy, stop it!
It's so nice to meet you.
A pleasure to meet a daughter who'd sacrifice so much for her father.
I would do anything for my Daddy.
This way, please.
The computer in this satchel provides me a secure link to my money.
The satchel cannot be removed from my arm during the operation.
All arrangements have been made--
Now, I chose your hospital for its high security standards.
We employ security with training equivalent to the secret service.
You won't be disappointed.
Very good!
Okay, you're going to Geneva to get a sample of a top-secret virus.
Now, your cover is you're going in for kidney transplants.
Well, now, you're probably thinking now,
"Hold on a second, Marshall!
We need our kidneys!"
Well, don't worry.
They're not going anywhere because of this.
Now, basically, when you are positioned in the OR, press this button lightly twice.
It will activate a tank of halothane.
Now, halothane is the same anesthetic they're pumping through your masks.
Why don't you both try counting backwards from ten?
Ten... nine... eight...
Which leads us to question number two.
If they're pumping anesthesia in the room and you're also gulping it down -- what did I do with -- by the maskful, then what's going to prevent us from passing out ourselves?
The solution is in the solution.
It's a mix of anti-anesthetia and I also, for good measure, threw in a time release synthetic caffeine that I use in my decaf every morning.
Just take it right before you head into the hospital and trust me, you won't fall asleep.
Six... five... four... three... two... one...
They'll be out for fifteen minutes.
They've all been sedated for the pain.
Patient zero's in there.
Get a blood sample, I'll download the viral research.
Irina?
I need help!
Don't struggle.
He could tear the gloves off, you could become infected.
I'll up his morphine.
Irina?
Irina?
His vitals fell below the preset warning levels.
The doctors will be alerted.
Work fast.
Eagle eye, this is blackbird.
Requiring early extraction, LZ Bravo.
Copy that, blackbird.
ETA -
- LZ Bravo, three minutes.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on!
This is Dr. Giselle, I need security teams on the research level, now!
We need to get to the roof.
The elevator won't come to this floor!
Security will flank us from both sides of the hall.
We can't reload the tranqs fast enough to take out another four people.
Find some iodine.
Ammonia and iodine form an unstable compound when they're mixed together.
Initiate level three lockdown, perimeter and elevators!
I've got this!
Blackbird, we're on the roof, we're waiting for you!
Don't shoot!
Against the wall!
Bypass the lockdown, I'll hold them off!
Buy me ten seconds, I need more time!
Ammo!
Sydney!
If you're wondering why that man mistook you for your mother, he worked for her.
I skimmed the research as it was downloading.
Before she surrendered to the CIA, Irina deliberately ordered
Sark to expose some of her own operatives to the virus in order to study it.
Ask yourself if that's a person worth saving.
I had toxicology analyze the glass of wine that somehow made its way into my house last week.
They found a compound called VTX which counteracts the effects of sodium morphate.
Sodium morphate is the poison I used to... end Emily's suffering.
I see two possibilities.
Either Emily predicted your intention to euthanize her, took the necessary countermeasures and is now playing a game with you, or the more likely scenario - someonewants you to believe Emily's alive or worse, they'll try and make the Alliance believe it, too.
If they think that I failied to carry out the one condition of my admittance, that I have been betraying them the whole time, then they'd be forced to assume that my entire division is rogue.
Then we'll all be in danger.
I don't think I can ever forgive my father for the things he's done, but maybe he's right about what he's been saying all alone.
Maybe her cooperation is partof some eleborate strategy he's more equipped to see than I am.
Look, your father's asking you to let her die for something she might do.
I don't think you can live with that.
Good work in Geneva.
Thanks.
The CIA is analyzing the copy of the disk you brought back.
If SD-6 plans on using the virus as a weapon we might be able to get a jump on the antidote thanks to the blood work you brought back.
I hope so.
Oh, listen, there's something else you should know.
Will came to me for a job.
He did?
Well, he didn't want to bother you so I hired him off the books to do some research.
On what?
Just background on the old KGB version of Project Christmas.
Of course, I didn't tell him that.
He thinks he's comparing IQ tests against the public record.
I just figured it was your perogative to tell him more.
That was really nice of you, thanks.
You're welcome.
There's nothing more boring than a commerce bureau luncheon.
Thanks for joining me, Jack.
What is it?
Did you... see that?
See what?
Can I help you?
Aaaah!
Did you see someone come in here just now?
A woman?
No, I've been alone all morning.
Father, would you excuse us, please?
Sit down.
Now you tell me you saw her!
I saw a woman but it could have been anyone.
You may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by intense feelings of guilt.
Arvin, you have walked into a church.
A place to confess.
She's alive.
She knew the alarm code.
She could have come into the house undetected.
There is a clear way to know for certain but I hesitate to suggest it.
Sir, there's something I have to report.
While it appeared that my mother sent me into a trap in Madagascar, in truth, she was unaware that there was any danger.
Yes, I know.
I have your father's statement right here.
He told us himself this morning.
What?
A hearing has been scheduled with the joint intelligence committee.
My intention wasn't to punish my father, sir, it was to stop my mother's execution from going forward.
Yes?
I'll send her down right now.
They'd like to see you in medical services.
You asked to see me?
Agent Bristow, I'm Doctor Nicholas.
What's going on?
Five weeks ago you infiltrated one of your mother's labratories in Taipei where you discovered a Rambaldi device.
How long were you in proximity to the device?
I... it took me about a minute to rig it with explosives.
I made it to the other side of the door but Vaughn was submerged.
I don't know, maybe another minute or two.
Will someone please tell me what's going on?
We believe the device is the source of the virus that infected the men in Geneva.
Unfortunately, you and Agent Vaughn may have been exposed.
I'm sorry.
We'd like to draw some blood and keep you under observation.
If Sloane pages me, this is gonna be a problem.
Your father's been informed.
He's covering for you.
I know.
Hi.
Hey.
Did you close your eyes at all?
On and off.
You talk in your sleep.
No!
What did I say?
"Don't frost the pie!" It seemed really important.
No idea.
You think we're sick?
I don't know.
Vaughn, can I tell you something?
Agent Bristow, your tests came back negative for antibodies, you're free to go.
Agent Vaughn, your tests at this point are inconclusive.
We did find a heightened level of antibodies in your blood stream but you could simply be fighting off a cold.
We won't know for a few more hours.
You'll have to stay.
You said Sark tested patient's blood at the first sign of infection.
What was the sign?
Hemorrhaging from the fingernails.
It'll be fine.
Your dad's hearing's in an hour, you should go.
I'll see you soon.
Yeah.
Agent Bristow, this hearing's been convened to determine an appropriate punishment for the crimes depicted in your statement.
Before we begin our inquiry, do you have anything to say?
Only that despite my admission of guilt, I still firmly believe Irina Derevko is a threat and will prove it at her earliest possible convenience.
Is that how you justify lying to your superiors, endangering other agents?
Yes.
Why this sudden change of heart?
Deferentially, Senator, my reasons are my own.
I see.
Reviewing your file, I was shocked to discover how many times you've displayed behavior that at best can be characterized as rogue.
You have lost the benefit of the doubt here, sir, and your silence will not suffice.
So again, I ask you, why the change of heart?
My daughter convinced me that I acted unethically.
Isn't it a fact that you knew your daughter intended to turn you in and that you beat her to the punch only by an hour in order to secure a degree of leniency from this body?
No, sir, that is not the case. (pause) Sydney Bristow, my daughter... has come to believe that when I look at her, I see the embodiment of all my flaws.
And this afternoon when I learned that she may have been exposed to a life-threatening disease,
I realized that she might die believing that.
But nothing could be further from the truth.
When I look at her, when I look at the little girl who raised herself to become one of the most extraordinary human beings and one of the finest agents I've ever had the privilege of knowing,
I see only the promise of my own redemption.
Turning myself in was the only way I could think of to make that clear to her, to prove that despite... my limited abilities as a father, I love her more than I could ever say.
I didn't order this.
It's from the gentleman at the bar.
You okay?
Yeah, clean bill of health.
Apparently, I am fighting a cold.
I came by to see you after the hearing but they were still running tests.
I know, they told me you came here.
(laughs) This is ridiculous, being in the same restaurant on the phone.
Listen, Syd, I, um, I actually came by to tell you something.
They're sending your father to prison.
You're kidding?
It gets worse.
Douglas decided your mother's immunity agreement was never binding.
They're going to carry out her death sentence anyway.
Her execution goes ahead tomorrow at eight am.
Welcome back to Washington, Senator.
Ed, you missed the exit.
Hello?
No!
No!
Hey!
You're making a BIG mistake!
Sorry about the detour, Senator...
What the hell are you doing?
!
...but I need two minutes of your undivided attention.
I don't care what point you want to make!
I'd like you to consider dropping the charges against my father and honor my mother's immunity agreement.
You can't be serious.
I recognize how indecisive this sounds--
That's a full understatement, my dear!
--I turned her in under false pretenses and I've come to believe my father was protecting me.
His interest are irrelevant, it's his decisions that matter.
I'm sorry, Agent Bristow, but my colleagues and I have zero tolerance for anyone who would lie to their own government, especially in this day and age.
And your mother?
Well, she's had it coming for twenty years.
Now given what you've been through,
I'm willing to forgive your little misstep tonight.
Would you kindly drop me off at home?
Wait in the car.
How did you persuade Douglas to reverse himself?
I told him I have a secret only you and I know about.
A secret that Sloane told you in confidence that poses such a threat to national security that we couldn't trust even the CIA to contain it.
What secret is that?
One of your colleagues -- a United States senator -- is working for the Alliance.
We have evidence of wire transfers totaling 6.3 million.
To whom?
That's what we're trying to find out.
But without my mother and father, I'll be forced to hand over the investigation to the FBI.
There's no senator in the Alliance's pocket.
You lied.
I'm not proud of what I did.
I may not agree with your decision to interact with your mother,
Sydney, but I will from now on respect that it is your decision to make.
They're bringing in your mother now.
I'm sure you'll want to see her.
Are you here to wish me luck being my first day on the job or are you convinced
I might reveal to Sloane that you conspired to kill him?
I'm here to remind you what I hope is obvious but I don't want to overestimate your intelligence.
If you burn me, I burn you.
Sydney, I couldn't reveal to Sloane that you conspired to kill him without also revealing my involvement.
Of course, I never had any intention of going through with it.
I simply needed to gain his trust.
You know what I think?
You're just a dog looking for a new master.
No need to worry, Sydney, we're colleagues now.
I'll see you at the office.
Sloane wouldn't agree to partner with him unless Sark made it worth his while.
Do you have any idea what they're after?
Given the scope of Sark's previous contacts and operations, he could be offering almost anything.
What concerns me more is that your mother knew we were double agents before she turned herself in.
She may have told Sark.
I'll find out.
Before you do, consider this -- two months ago she surrendered to the CIA.
Yesterday,
Sark made a back-door agreement with
Sloane that places him inside SD-6.
Do you belive that's just a coincidence?
As you know, Mr. Sark surrendered to us last week.
After an extensive debriefing with McCullough, we've concluded he can provide us with credible intel.
Enough, in fact, to warrant an immunity deal in exchange for his cooperation.
Sir, I believe this decision is a critical mistake.
This man has murdered hundreds of people for profit.
We should not set the precedent of granting immunity to a terrorist no matter what he says he has to offer.
Yes, well, I understand your frustration,
Agent Dixon, but I believe that Sark's cooperation will save more lives than he's taken.
I'm with Dixon on this.
We have developed a strategy to address your concerns.
Jack.
In order to maintain Sark's value as an informant, his contacts must not be aware that he's turned himself in.
Beginning today, whenever Sark leaves this office a security section team will double as his private detail to ensure that he doesn't violate his agreement with us.
I, uh, I'm sorry I'm late.
Marshall Flinkman, technical operations officer.
Hi.
Welcome.
Don't kill me.
Look, I understand that none of you are inclined to believe a word I say but I assure you, it's not in my best interest to betray you.
You've given me an opportunity of a lifetime, and I don't intend to squander it.
So that's how Sloane and Sark have presented their new partnership.
No one at SD-6 likes it but they all believe it.
I need to know if you've ever told Sark that I'm a double agent.
Sydney, no.
You saved Vaughn's life.
I'm grateful to you for that but I haven't made up my mind yet if I should trust you.
And yet here you are.
I never told Sark about your status as a double agent,
Sydney.
That doesn't mean you're safe.
Tell me, what intelligence has he provided
Sloane?
Zoran Sokolov.
A freelance mercenary who's had extensive dealings with Mr. Sark.
Yes, he frequently offers me the chance to purchase intelligence before he brings it to the black market.
Recently he asked me if I'd be interested in obtaining a set of communication codes used by Uzbekistan's
ground forces along the border.
If we don't obtain those codes Sokolov will sell them to extremist rebels hiding in neighboring Tajikistan.
With those codes, they can track Uzbek troop movements and plan terrorist attacks.
This would gravely destabilize our allies in
Asia.
Sydney, you and Dixon will make contact with this Sokolov.
Posing as
Sark's associates, you will purchase the codes and bring them here.
We both know Sloane doesn't care about preserving stability in Asia so my question is why does he want those communication codes so badly?
I'm going to ask you to give me something you have no reason to give.
I'm going to ask for your faith.
You have to convince your superiors to let me leave this place.
What?
!
For forty-eight hours.
Are you serious?
I'll agree to a special forces escort.
Why?
I cannot tell you that.
Go where?
If you do not trust me, I cannot help you later.
What are those codes for?
I'm trying to help you--
How am I going to sell this?
--but I must be allowed to do it MY way.
Yeah, well, it's asking too much!
I cannot give you details because I don't trust the CIA.
They almost had me executed two weeks ago.
The only way for me to maintain my value is to tell you only what you need to know in order to stay ahead of
Sloane.
And all you need to know now is that if I'm not allowed to leave, everything you've worked to accomplish
will be lost.
Agent Bristow, you're asking me to get
Irina Derevko a forty-eight hour--
I'm asking you to consider it.
But you can't tell me why.
She won't say why.
Sloane tasked you to acquire Uzbekistan's ground force communication codes.
And how does success or failure risk what we've been--
My mother's clearly worried about something else.
Some unintended consequence that we can't predict.
Sir, thus far, Derevko's intel has been right one hundred percent of the time.
We didn't catch this woman.
She turned herself in.
She's agreed to be escorted by a special forces team and wear a tracking device.
She will not get away.
Jack, you've been awfully quiet.
I'm sorry.
When it comes to Irina Derevko, my judgment's proven to be... impaired.
Well, I would like your opinion.
Perhaps they're right.
Perhaps releasing her is worth the risk to satisfy our curiosity.
Well, hell, when you put it that way, the answer's definitely no.
If Irina Derevko wants out of here, she's going to have to tell us more.
Otherwise, you're to proceed as planned.
Agent Vaughn will give you your countermission.
Thanks.
You told Kendall your judgment wasn't to be trusted and then agreed with me to reinforce his doubt.
Kendall's ego predisposes him to favor decisions in which he is overruling others.
You argue your way, I'll argue mine.
Your countermission's simple.
You'll dead drop a copy of the codes when you get back from Uzbekistan so we can figure out what they're really for.
I have to go pack.
I must admit, this is one of the most impressive operations I've seen.
Though it is a touch pathetic how so many of them believe they actually work for the CIA.
Look at me.
You've offered me a substantial prize to make our partnership worthwhile, but do not think for a second that gives you the right to insult my people.
I apologize.
I had a run-in with Sydney Bristow this morning.
She may be the only one who suspects I haven't in fact turned myself in.
I've been a presence in Sydney's life since she was born.
Sydney will believe whatever I tell her to.
And her father?
He must often battle the temptation to tell her the truth about SD-6.
I'd hate to see Jack's paternal instincts compromise our objectives.
So, for the time being, I wouldn't tell him what those codes are really for.
Yeah?
Sir, a call's been routed to you through
Credit Dauphine.
Take a message.
He says it's regarding your wife.
That will be all.
Put him through.
I want you to record this call.
Hello?
We have your wife, and, yes, she's alive.
You will provide us with the account numbers for all SD-6's investments or the
Alliance will be informed that you failed to carry out her execution.
Offer me proof that she's alive.
Until then, know this: as soon as I hang up the phone I will use every available resource to find out who I'm talking to and when I do, it will be my sincere pleasure to make your acquaintance.
So, um... you work for Sark.
Tell him I'm insulted he didn't come here personally.
We'll make sure he gets the message.
Mr. Sokolov, we're on a schedule.
Do you have the codes?
Do you have the money?
Wait.
The codes are on a computer in this case.
The case, before I stole it, belonged to a colonel in the Uzbek army.
What I didn't realize when I made the offer to Sark is that without the colonel's fingerprint the case cannot be opened without detonating a self-destruct mechanism inside.
Boom!
Are you telling us you cannot deliver what you've promised us?
Please.
I wouldn't have asked you to come all this way without a solution to this little problem.
I have arranged for
Colonel to be someplace tonight where you can take his prints.
How exactly did you do that?
I had him assassinated.
Are you in yet?
That microchip you gave me is not exactly state of the art.
It's still reading morgue records off the central server.
Okay, Dixon, I'm in.
Me, too, Sydney.
Stand by.
What was Colonel's name?
Vasili Kabilov.
Sydney, you're looking for Vasili Kabilov.
ID tag C16.
Dixon, don't shoot!
It's me!
Get in!
I know.
Sydney told me about Project
Christmas, about how it was developed to identify future spies and now you're worried because you think the Russians might have used it to recruit American children back in the '80s?
About that--
The thing is, I think there might be something to your theory.
Really?
Remember those weird test questions you gave me, the ones that the KGB developed?
I found them.
I found them integrated into a series of standardized tests that were administered here in 1982.
How many kids took that test?
Five million.
Well, look, I didn't think Devlin -- my superior -- would mind me having you research this, but he did and he ordered me to let you go.
Hold on.
Wait a second.
There's something here.
Okay, look, I'll narrow the test scores down to a small group of kids.
Now
Devlin won't be able to deny the value of that.
He thinks since you're a journalist, since you've been trained to report what you know, that you're a security risk.
Don't sweat it.
Here's what I owe you.
There's seven hundred in there.
I didn't work that many hours.
Seriously, I don't know how you did it so fast.
I told you to take your time.
Thanks, but, um, my time's all I expect to get paid for.
All right.
Hey.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing's wrong?
Syd... if we just met, I would know something's wrong.
Do you remember Mr. Sark?
Do I remember the guy who shot me with a tranquilizer?
The guy who had me tortured in Taipei?
He's working with SD-6.
I can't tell you any more than that.
You've seen him?
You're working with him?
I have to make him think I am.
That little British cocky son of a bitch is in LA?
Hey, Syd, I'm on-line with the spa.
Did you want to get a Swedish or a Shiatsu massage?
Uh...
You have to reschedule.
Believe me, there is nothing I would rather do than spend a day with you at the spa.
How about next week?
Next week's great.
But I am still gonna go tomorrow.
Okay, I want to kill that Sark guy.
I know.
No, this is gonna drive me insane, you know that.
Will, you asked me to tell you.
I know I did.
I just didn't know it was going to be a nightmare.
He's almost killed me, too.
I know, but you get to do something about it, you know?
I mean, yeah, you get to go off and be sneaky and ultimately destroy the guy.
What about your work with Vaughn?
Vaughn sort of fired me.
The CIA's just going to ignore everything
Will found out?
Actually, when Devlin heard that five million American first graders took a standardized test that may have been doctored by the KGB, he sent Will's research to the FBI.
And?
We're still waiting for the results.
That's the second time Will's come through for us, I wish there were more I could do for him, I really do.
He's a good guy.
Thanks.
Syd...
This watch belonged to my father.
It's broken now, but it used to keep perfect time.
And when he gave it to me, he said,
"You could set your heart by this watch."
It stopped October 1st -- the day we met.
Kendall.
Me too.
What's going on?
We just heard from analysis about the codes you acquired in Uzbekistan.
Sloane and Sark gave us a half-truth.
The codes are Uzbek but they have nothing to do with troop communications.
What are they for?
They're the control codes for six portable nuclear warheads that the Uzbeks have admitted and defense intelligence has confirmed went missing six months ago.
SD-6 is in possession of six nuclear weapons?
No.
This morning Sark electronically messengered the codes to an unknown third party.
We couldn't trace the link.
And all we know about them is that they're working with Sloane and Sark?
Why did Sloane keep you in the dark on this?
I don't know.
This is what my mother was talking about.
We should have listened to her.
Well, if she was so concerned about helping us stay ahead of SD-6, she could have told us what was at stake.
And what would you have done?
Given Sydney false control codes to hand over to SD-6?
Sark may have known the difference and she would have been exposed as a double agent.
I wasn't willing to risk her life that way.
Do you know where the nukes are?
Yes, I do.
Where?
I've spent the last thirty-six nights lying on a steel mattress.
And what the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means I would appreciate a pillow and blanket.
Done.
Tell us about the warheads.
They're in Kashmir, under what used to be a maximum security prison camp.
It's now the stronghold for a mercenary group --
The People's Revolutionary Front.
So Sloane and Sark have in fact partnered with this organization?
It would appear.
Can you give us the prison camp's exact coordinates?
Yes.
I'm going to recommend to the defense department an immediate air strike.
When the smoke clears we can dig the warheads out of the rubble.
I wouldn't do that.
Now that the PRF has the control codes, they may have set the warheads to detonate in the event of sabotage or a preemptive strike.
What about sending in a commando unit?
If they were familiar with the facility,
I'd say it was a good idea.
That's what you were planning on doing.
Yes.
That's impossible to verify.
All right, Miss Derevko.
You're going to lead us into that prison.
Oh, no, I'm not.
My offer expired the moment the detonation codes were acquired.
Do I have to remind you that your immunity deal is contingent upon your continued cooperation?
I have cooperated, Agent Kendall.
You didn't listen.
Now, if you'd bring me my pillow and blanket...
No, you listen to me.
I'm authorized to put you in solitary.
You're lucky you have a view of this hallway!
Agent Kendall... may I speak to my mother alone please?
Sydney, I'm sorry.
You said you didn't tell us the truth because you were trying to protect me, because you didn't want to risk Sark finding out that I was a double agent.
The thing is, someone now has the ability to detonate six nuclear weapons and I am responsible.
So I am going to be part of the team that finds and disarms those warheds no matter what you do.
But if you were telling the truth when you said you wanted to protect me, then, Mom...
I need your help.
You convinced your mother to go to
Kashmir.
I told her if she didn't lead the team to the warheads, I would.
I handed those codes to SD-6.
Your guilt is unfounded.
You were doing your job.
I'm going, Dad.
Defense approved it.
I am not about to let Irina Derevko near six nuclear weapons supervised only by you.
Plane leaves in an hour.
Obviously you can't maintain your cover if you're shackled.
So there are two things you need to know about this necklace.
One, it's layered with C-4.
If you remove it while it's armed, you'll break the circuit and it will detonate.
And two, if at any moment I believe you're attempting to escape or sabotage us, I'll activate this remote trigger and blow your head off myself.
All right, here's how this works.
Derevko will detail your infiltration into the facility once you reach it.
Until then, you have operational control.
The unrest in Kashmir has caused both
Pakistan and India to seal their borders so you'll board a train in New Delhi.
There's a three-mile stretch of track that passes through the eastern tip of Kashmir.
That's where you'll get off.
Your gear will be planted in the baggage car.
Once you're off the train you'll rendezvous with the CIA contact who will provide you with the op tech you'll need to infiltrate the facility.
How did you clear this with Sloane?
I took care of Sloane.
There's a C-5 prepped and waiting at the
Van Nuys airport.
They'll escort you.
Good luck.
I'll talk to you when you reach the contact.
Agent Vaughn has trouble sleeping when you're in the field.
I doubt he told you that.
He didn't have to tell me, I could see it in his eyes.
I can see it in yours.
Agent Vaughn is my colleague.
You're so willing to take risks for your country.
Why aren't you willing to do the same for your own happiness?
I hardly think you've earned the right to give anyone relationship advice.
Jack, Sydney's smart and she's strong, but she's not happy.
Okay, wait a second, this--
And after a twenty-year absence you've gleamed that from the cumulative half-hour you've spent in her presence?
I knew it the moment I saw her.
I'm her mother.
Your motherhood is a biological fact with no substantive value in Sydney's life!
Hey!
Stop baiting him.
And stop being such an easy target.
We're going to be traveling together for the next two days, you can't jump down her throat every time she opens her mouth.
Hope I didn't pull you away from something too important.
No, it's all right.
What's up?
Look, except for you, Sydney, and Jack, everybody I know -- and a lot of people I don't -- they think I'm a lying junkie, okay?
And helping you, doing something for the CIA, it felt like a chance to do something that mattered again, you know?
Like, I don't know, maybe I went through all this crap for a reason.
What is this?
I know you can't pay me, it doesn't matter.
You're looking at forty names.
Those are forty kids that got a perfect score on the standardized test that included the Project Christmas questions.
How did you get this?
Between '80 and '85, Carnegie Mellon conducted a cultural bias study on standardized testing.
Not only did they have the results, but they cross- referenced them by name and ethnicity.
The FBI has been trying to narrow down a list of kids for as long as you have and so far they haven't come up with a single name.
That's probably because they don't know that the test records from '82 were missing from the testing service archives.
What do you mean, they're missing?
Who took them?
I don't know yet.
What is the purpose of your visit to
India?
Family vacation.
We're touring the
Kaziranga national park by train.
Not exactly a vacation when you're forced to go.
No offense.
Cute country.
Honey, we agreed we'd spend Thanksgiving together.
Yeah, before I found out all my friends were going to be in Miami.
Okay, we're not going to talk about this now.
I do apologize.
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That is a lovely necklace you're wearing.
An anniversary gift from my husband.
Thanks!
Huh?
I'm sorry, I was trying to call information.
Perhaps I can help.
Our team is en route.
They'll be at the rendezvous at 2200.
I understand.
The CIA contact has been activated.
You miss, are in sleeper "G" and Mr. and
Mrs. Godson, you are right next to her in sleeper "H." The rest of your luggage will be in the cargo hold.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That bridge is the point of no return.
If you're lying about this, none of us will survive.
I'd offer to go first but I don't want to be accused of trying to escape.
We go at the same time!
Sydney, you follow.
That's not safe.
These winds are too strong, our chutes could get tangled.
You go first.
I'm not letting you out of my sight!
You go first.
You'll have to trust me sometime!
Trust is the last thing you're getting from me!
The only reason you know about the nukes is because of me.
I want some respect.
We'll miss our window unless you jump!
Shut up!
I told you to follow us once we jumped.
We were going to miss our window.
Sydney, I need to know I can count on you whether you agree with me or not.
Okay.
There.
Agent Bristow, so good to see you again.
It's been a long time, Saeed.
This is my daughter, Sydney.
Ah, your reputation is beginning to rival your father's.
Nice to meet you.
Saeed Akhtar, Irina Derevko.
She's assisting us on loan from FBI custody.
Your last name's Akhtar, but your accent has a trace of Hindi.
My mother is from Jammu.
Your parents were brave to marry, knowing the prejudice they'd face.
Let's get moving.
I have everything you need to infiltrate the prison camp undetected.
MBGs, kevlar
BDUs, encryption sat-comms, three pounds of C-4 charges, and a cryo-3 radiation detector to help you locate the nukes.
How far away is the PRF stronghold?
Nine hours.
Outside Muzaffarabad.
None for her.
Sir, this was sent to the mail room.
We scanned it for biological contaminates.
It's clean.
Back up.
Jack?
Back up now!
International aid workers here.
I am disgusted one of my own countrymen would assist the CIA.
I assume you speak for your unit?
Yes.
We know you're looking for the People
Revolutionary Front.
We thought we'd make it easy for you.
Here we are.
Is there something you'd like to tell us?
e'd like the warheads you've acquired.
I'm sure.
Thank you for the supplies.
Are you okay?
It's just a scratch.
Drop it.
Dad--
Quiet!
Jack, we're in enemy territory and the PRF knows we're here.
We need to start trusting each other right now.
You will not carry a weapon.
Okay.
Looks like we're about twenty miles southwest of Azad.
We can contact the CIA station chief in
Pakistan.
He'll patch us through to
Langley on a secure line.
We should make it by dawn.
Of course.
Of course.
Absolutely.
Mr. Vaughn--
Yes, sir.
Mr. Vaughn!
Yes, sir.
As soon as we find out.
The necklace has been deactivated.
I'll have to call you back. (hangs up) When?
Just now.
You've confirmed this?
Yes.
Satellite imagery detected combat.
Combat?
What just happened?
It's over.
Can we tell if there's any survivors?
Not with this bird.
We need new satellites.
Even if they survive, sending in a team is out of the question.
Why?
They're on an authorized mission.
A clandestine mission!
If we start scouring the countryside, the Indian government is going to figure out that Pakistani- supported rebels in Azad Kashmir have acuired nuclear weapons.
They're going to launch preemptive strikes.
The
Pakistanis are going to retaliate, and I'm going to get called in front of a half a dozen congressional committees demanding to know why we screwed up!
So the only thing we're interested in right now is how to make this problem disappear.
I want an options paper from you in two hours.
And after that I'd like to look quietly for the Bristows myself.
Nuclear weapons.
Nu-cl-ear.
I understand.
I shouldn't have to define your priorities for you.
Obviously.
I just don't think we should cut them loose.
Listen.
Alive or dead, the mission failed.
So if the Bristows are out there, they're on their own.
Hey, man.
Check this out.
Nothing like more bad news, huh?
Maybe they were just a roving patrol.
No.
PRF rebels would never be this deep into Indian territory without being dispatched.
Your father's right.
We had one advantage -- surprise.
Now that's gone.
Just a second.
Can't stop.
More patrols could be in the area.
Oooh, God.
What happened?
Nothing, I just scraped my leg.
Dad, I can do it.
I got it.
You need to stop the bleeding.
Where are you going?
These bushes, they have communis berries.
Their juice soothes the skin, helps healing.
You should put this on first.
Seriously, I'm fine.
You're not fine.
No, you're not fine.
Jack, I know you're determined to get to Srinagar but my contact in Jaipur is much closer.
He's completely reliable, he has good equipment--
This is a CIA mission.
I have operation control.
You're a prisoner.
Your only function -- sole reason you're momentarily breathing fresh air, is to use your knowledge of the rebels' base to help us steal the suitcase nukes and leave.
That's why we're using people I know and trust.
We're not having this conversation again.
You okay?
Yeah, thanks.
This is not a power play.
The facility we're headed for, security's tighter than the NSA.
If I don't have the right equipment, it's pointless.
We should move.
Okay.
I know what you're thinking.
Do you?
The toaster.
What are you guys talking about?
Ah...
We used to have this toaster at home.
It was broken and using it one night, I started a small fire.
We had something like this to drink and we both had a little too much.
I forgot about the toast I was making.
When was this?
You were... four years old.
There was so much smoke, we had to move out for a week.
We stayed in that hotel.
The Summit.
The Summit.
W-wait was that the hotel with the sundaes?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
I think you had one every night.
You should get some sleep.
Jack?
I would have called.
I need your help.
Yes, yes, of course.
No one can see you dressed like this.
That's one of the reasons we're here.
It's good to see you again.
You, too.
You look well.
Well, imagine how bad I looked before, heh heh.
Are you who I think?
Is she yours?
Yes.
He always brags about you.
He showed me a picture once--
We need to penetrate a class-A target outside Muzaffarabad.
We'll need aliases, papers, transpo, ammo, sat phone, and security penetration.
Yes.
Would you like some tea?
No, thank you.
We also need tactical gear and high-resolution night vision goggles.
Yes.
Except no.
My main supplier died two months ago.
Saresh was killed?
Heart attack.
We are old men, Jack.
We don't live forever, especially in Kashmir.
Of course, um, I can provide aliases, basic weapons, access to satellite phone and transportation.
What kind of security?
Biometric sensors, dual infrared passive and microwave sensors, fiber optic on the fence.
What's your timeframe?
We have none.
We're already behind schedule.
Well I can do what I can do, but it might not be enough for you.
We'll take whatever you've got.
Thank you.
Yes.
First thing, you need to be looking not like you.
Hello?
Hi.
I'm on a secure line.
Sydney, we saw the blast.
What happened?
I'll fill you in later but we were compromised.
I'm so glad you're okay.
What about your parents?
You know, some people go miniature golfing with their parents.
We go to India and look for nukes.
Listen, Sydney, we intercepted a communication.
The rebels say they're planning on activating the nukes tomorrow at 1700 hours.
Activate how?
We don't know.
Deploy?
Detonate?
Activate, that's the word they used.
Now, it might mean delivery, maybe detonation, we don't know.
But we have to assume the worst since they got the control codes through SD-6.
And I got the control codes for SD-6 which means I can deactivate the nukes.
If you get there in time.
Perfect.
Here.
My truck is parked on the other side of the market.
I owe you.
What kind of air filter does it have?
A foam filter.
That won't work.
It'll clog up in the desert conditions.
We'll return the truck as soon as we can.
We cannot use this truck, it'll never get us there.
Irina--
I know you think I'm always second-guessing you--
I told you--
But if we don't get a car with a--
This is my decision and it is not negotiable!
Listen to me, both of you!
We have a job to do.
Your issues are going to have to be dealt with later.
Please excuse us.
Right now we have six suitcase nukes that are going to be activated tomorrow.
Is that confirmed?
CIA doesn't have any details, they want us to deactivate the nukes and steal them.
CIA needs to get authorization for a preemptive strike now.
They need confirmation that the nukes are there.
It'll be too late by then.
Not if we work together.
This is the way it's going to be.
Dad will decide how we get to the base.
It's his call.
Once we arrive, Mom takes over.
You were an officer there, you know your way around.
You'll lead us into the facility to the nukes and back out.
Then you will resume control and get us home.
There will be no objections to and no deviations from this plan.
Three of these bins are filled with grain.
Irina, you'll be in the fourth.
You can't be serious!
She's the most likely to be recognized.
The rebels are looking for a three-person team.
So we have a better chance of avoiding detection if we alter our configuration.
Are you sure she can breathe in there?
Dad, we need to get moving.
I know.
I'm just... preparing myself to let Irina out.
It will be fine.
Sydney, I've been doing this job a long time so when you lectured me about continuing the mission and letting down protocol--
Dad, my point was--
I know what your point was, and the truth is, I needed to hear it.
I'm proud of you, that's all.
Thank you.
What are we doing here?
This is not the drop.
The filter got clogged, didn't it?
We're still ten miles away from the base.
We need to hike to the field where we'll access a sewage tunnel that'll lead us into the facility.
I thought you said security was heavy.
It is on the other side of the facility.
At the entry point we're using, the rebels rely on land mines to keep intruders away.
We don't have the equipment to detect land mines.
We don't have the equipment because your contact didn't come through.
I know where the mines are planted.
You want to walk through a minefield you haven't seen in nineteen years?
Is there another way?
And assume no new mines have been planted?
I just spent five hours in a grain bin.
It's my turn now.
Let's get to it.
I just spoke with Gerard Cuvee, leader of the PRF.
He's quite charming, really -- more like a banker than a rebel leader.
But then you're a money man too, aren't you?
Is everything in place?
The nuclear cores will be activated at 1700 hours.
As soon as it's done, they'll upload the results to our servers.
Yeah?
Sir, I have someone calling regarding your wife.
They won't identify themselves.
Record the call.
I need some privacy.
Yeah?
Romantic touch, don't you think?
Your wife's ring finger.
By now your lab's confirmed that despite your best efforts, you didn't kill Emily and now I have her.
What do you want?
One hundred million in bearer bonds.
This is about money?
Everything is about money.
Instructions for the drop have been electronically mailed to you.
You have twenty-four hours.
Fail to deliver the bonds, and the next delivery will go to the Alliance.
Where did the PRF get all these mines?
You Americans have the worst inventory controls in the world.
So, Sydney, how is school?
I'm writing my dissertation... supposedly.
Quiet.
Behind the tree!
To your left, Jack!
Jack, I need a gun!
Don't move!
You're on a mine.
Sydney, don't move.
Five steps forward.
Three to your left.
And then straight towards us.
Are you hurt?
No.
The bullet hit my vest.
It's an M-26 anti-personnel mine.
We'll need to pry off the panel and remove the blasting cap.
You need to cut the detonator core that leads to the blasting cap.
Her knife's not coated.
If she cuts the wire with metal, she'll complete the circuit and set it off.
I can do it.
It's okay.
Over that hill is the entrance to the sewer tunnel.
We should hurry.
Follow closely.
Contact the Bristows, tell them to pull out immediately.
I have no way of initiating.
Why?
The Indians found out the Pakastani rebels have acquired nukes.
They're launching air strikes in twenty-four hours.
What?
We have to get them to back off!
We're trying, but they're angry that we knew about the nukes and keptit from them.
They're insisting on going forward.
Then let me make a personal appeal.
Vaughn, everybody is working on this already -- state, NSC,
DOD.
Look, you're probably going to say no to this but I want to go to India.
I was stationed there for two years, I have relationships--
Go.
Go?
I'll have a military aircraft waiting.
This is totally back channel.
You're just gonna--Are you trying to get rid of me?
Clear.
We're here.
The nukes will either be in a sealed RD lab or a vault located in the sub-basement.
The lab's the better bet because its security system is more sophisticated.
So we check the vault first.
Not if we only get one shot.
The lab has thermal sensors to detect intruders through their body heat.
If we raise the room to body temperature -- 98.6 degrees -- the sensors won't be able to distinguish between us and the thermostat level of the lab.
Sydney, you'll get to the central heating control panel here.
It's located in a room near the stairwell in the sub- basement.
Find the panel for zone three.
Got it.
Jack, the lab door is controlled by a voice recognition system, only Cuvee's voice is programmed to open it.
We need to break into the main computer system here to access his file.
You'll erase his voice and substitute your own.
I'll be in
Cuvee's private office.
You and I are not separating.
Not in here.
Jack, listen to me.
Unless I deactivate the facility's surveillance system from Cuvee's office, we won't get anywhere near the nukes.
No.
You've done good work getting us here.
I'm not blind to that.
But I'm also far from trusting you.
If you want those nukes for yourself, this is a perfect setup.
You were an office here in this facility, you've got friends here willing to work with you.
Friends?
You know what this place was when I was here,
Jack?
A prison.
Where the KGB interrogated suspected traitors and no, I wasn't an office here.
I was a prisoner.
Why do you think I learned the sewage tunnels or memorized the mine locations?
So I could escape, you idiot.
We're out of time.
We either separate and meet at the lab in five minutes or we're going back.
It's your choice.
Dad, she's right.
We don't have any more time.
I'll be in the lab in five minutes.
I promise.
You better be.
Mera naam Gerard Cuvee.
Mera naam Gerard Cuvee.
Thank you for agreeing to this emergency meeting.
Despite my best efforts to comply with your orders to kill my wife after she learned the truth about SD-6, someone interfered.
And this person is now extorting me for her return.
Last week, the blackmailers sent me Emily's finger -- her ring finger.
Lab tests confirmed that Emily was alive when they severed the finger.
Blood coagulation tests are not one hundred per cent accurate.
Yes, but they are reliable.
And then two days ago security section obtained those.
Those are photos of airport security in Santiago and London.
And we have confirmed that Emily was on flight manifests last week.
Any idea on the men with her?
No.
But the blackmailer wants a hundred million in bearer bonds for her return.
Who else knew about your instruction to kill Emily?
Only the people in this room.
You believe one of us may be behind this?
No.
But someone has infiltrated our secure communications.
Well, whoever it is, will get nothing.
No, it's not quite that simple.
We have to eliminate this leak before more damaging information about the Alliance gets out.
So I propose that we put a tracking device on the bonds, that we make this exchange, that we follow the blackmailer and we assassinate him.
You understand, Arvin, after all this, if you get your wife back she will still have to be eliminated.
I understand.
The thermal sensors are neutralized.
Where's your mother?
I haven't seen her.
We got this far.
She must have gotten to
Cuvee's office and disabled the surveillance system.
She'll be here.
Mera naam Gerard Cuvee.
We're not waiting.
Use the control codes to begin the deactivation.
The plutonium core is gone.
Hi, Mr. Sloane, it's me.
Marshall.
Sorry.
You probably already know that, we, uh, planned this.
Anyway.
The tracer on the bonds is working perfectly.
Good.
I'm turning off my comm.
Yeah?
I see you.
Leave the briefcase on the bench and keep walking.
Proceed toward the corner while we verify the authenticity of the bonds.
Oh yeah!
I got you!
Right into my wheelhouse!
C'mon!
Go to the row of vending machines.
Take the "City View,"
fifth from the top.
I say, c'mon!
Unh!
C'mon!
Wait a minute.
Wait!
No!
Where did-
- Oh, God, no.
NO! Not to brag, but I'm kind of responsible for matchmaking you
and Irina.
Didn't she tell you?
I was a supervisor at the KGB.
I was the one who gave her the assignment to go to the US and marry a CIA officer.
Now, you weren't the only prospect, of course.
But you had the most potential.
Ha!
I actually thought it would dawn on you that a woman like this would never go for someone like you.
Luckily for me, your ego was too big for that.
You're a dead man!
No, wait, wait.
I want what we came for.
Sark's made a deal with us.
What kind of double cross is he planning? We know Sark has a new partner.
Who is it? Get the information.
And meet me in my office.
Damn it.
I was caught.
I had to do this or we'd all be killed.
They're not detonating the nukes.
Here's what you have to do...
Is everything on target?
We ran into a few problems but, uh...
What kind of problems?
We've got it under control.
We'll proceed as planned.
Then I'll expect your report on the Rambaldi artifact within the hour.
Trust me on this.
If you don't make it out,
I'm sorry this happened.
Ugh!
Mr. Vaughn, good to see you again.
But I'm afraid you came a long way for nothing.
General, we have people at the PRF base right now stealing the nukes.
And if they fail, we'll be the Pakistani's first target.
They won't fail.
You can't guarantee that.
General, if you launch those strikes now, you'll be killing some of our best assets.
Mr. Vaughn, your govnernment knew the rebels acquired the suitcase nukes and still they said nothing.
They placed our whole country at risk.
At least delay a few hours until we get our people out!
I'm sorry.
The air strikes go as planned.
You look more like your father every time I see you, you know that?
My father wrote about you in his journal.
He wrote that he trusted you and respected you.
And that is why I came such a long way.
I cannot call off the strikes but I will give you a headstart.
Meaning what?
Meaning a chopper and pilot.
But if you are going to try to rescue your friends, you are doing so at your own risk.
Dad!
How'd you get free? Sydney, your mother was helping us.
What?
What about Cuvee?
She was torturing you!
She was putting on a show for Cuvee.
Before she left, she put these in my hand.
She told me they're using the cores to activate a Rambaldi artifact.
They're not detonating the nukes?
Among the things Rambaldi experimented with was self- sustaining cell regeneration.
This artifact they're opening today is reported to be Rambaldi's proof of endless life.
Endless life?
We have no time to make any meaningful assessments.
All I know is that your mother claims to have provided us with an opportunity to contact the CIA for extraction and we should act on it.
Can't this thing go any faster?
This is it!
We're going against the wind!
Operations.
Boot camp, this is Mountaineer.
Voice ID number Alpha,
Charlie, 710.
I need to speak with Agent Vaughn.
Vaughn's not available.
Let me give you Kendall.
Agent Bristow, do you have the package?
We're in process.
We'll need extraction within the hour.
Abort.
The Indians hve launched air strikes against the base.
Air strikes?
We're not finished, you have to get them to hold off!
Listen to me.
Fighter planes are in the sky, you have to leave now.
Not until we get my mother.
Agent Bristow, I'm ordering you to pull out and head for the extraction point, immediately!
This is Jack.
You'll either hear from us again, or you won't.
Our assignment from the CIA is to bring her back.
That's our job.
Flower?
That's what this is all about?
We need to get the cores and get out of here.
It's Vaughn!
Got the cores!
Tell them to call off the air strikes!
This is Agent Vaughn!
Abort the air strikes!
I repeat, abort the air strikes!
You must have a lot of questions.
Yeah.
One thing that should not wait any longer is why I shot you in
Taipei.
The rebel leader, Gerard Cuvee...
When you were in
Taipei, he was in the next room watching to see if I would betray him or you.
Shooting you in the shoulder, giving you time to escape, it was the only way I could think to maintain his trust and keep him from killing both of us.
We're both tired.
You should get some rest.
You, too...
Mom.
Hi.
Hey.
Any word on the flower?
Preliminary analysis indicates that it's anywhere from four to six hundred years old.
Like I said, preliminary.
What's this?
When I found out my mother faked her death twenty years ago, after mourning her for most of my life, she was still alive.
I tried to imagine what it would feel like to stand in a room with both of my parens again.
It seemed impossible.
That two people with so much...
deceit between them could ever find a way to breathe the same air.
And all of a sudden there we were.
Just the three of us... walking down a dirt road in the middle of Kashmir.
When we were out there, working as a team, it was comforting.
We were ambushed and we fought back.
And we survived.
Yeah, my parents and I sort of went through the same thing.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Oh!
Vaughn told me Devlin approved you to do research if you pass the Moglin-Reich allegiance test.
This is your SOP on where to meet for the pick-up.
Remember to drop--
Drop it in the large--yeah.
Hey.
What's up?
Where you been?
Okay, listen.
Every time I walk into the room lately, you guys hush up as if I'm interrupting something.
I mean, am I?
What?
No.
Francie, seriously, we were just talking.
Why don't you have a seat?
I can't.
I gotta--I forgot my keys.
I gotta open the restaurant.
I'll see ya.
Okay.
Kendall's allowed me fifteen minutes here, twice a week.
You put in the request, didn't you, to give me time out here?
Yeah.
We appreciated your help in Kashmir.
I need you to understand...
I was eighteen when the KGB recruited me.
For a woman to be asked to serve her country, it was a future, it meant...
empowerment, independence.
I was a fool to think that any ideology could come before my daughter.
Sydney?
Hey, stand down!
Back away NOW!
Let me see your hands!
What is this?
!
We have an arrangement!
Yes.
One you failed to live up to.
Our operation in Kashmir was a waste of SD-6 resources.
We acquired nothing.
So my question is, have you betrayed me or are you simply incompetent?
This interrogation technique was developed by the Khmer Rouge.
Minimize brusing on political prisoners when they were allowing them to be photographed.
You see, if I pull this just a little harder the glass will break.
And I do not want to do that.
So tell me, do you think that we were unlucky on our first venture together or do you have another plan that you want to tell me about?
I didn't betray you.
We agreed to combine our efforts.
I swear to you, that's still my intent!
Then tell me what went wrong in Kashmir.
The Indian western command carried out an air strike on the PRF prison.
The Rambaldi artifact was destroyed.
My contact in the region, Gerard Cuvee, mistakenly believes I tipped the Indian authorities off.
With all due respect sir, could the leak have come from this office?
So Sloane has no idea you sabotaged the operation in Kashmir?
If he did, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Since Sark failed to deliver on his promise with Sloane, their partnership may not last for long.
Unfortunately, it isn't over yet.
Sloane is sending me to Paris with Sark tonight.
Why?
The Echelon satellite system.
Phone calls, e-mails, faxes from around the world are filtered through a program capable of flagging key words on an NSA watch list.
Echelon has been immeasurably successful in indicating threats to our national security.
Mr. Sark has provided us with new intelligence indicating that an enemy of this country may have acuired the ability to access this terminal.
Gerard Cuvee, former leader of the People's Revolutionary Front
-- a crime syndicate whose headquarters were raided by Indian authority last week.
Mr. Sark?
My dealings with Gerard Cuvee go back several years.
He once showed me an Echelon access terminal he stole from the NSA that he keeps at a front company in Paris.
Recent attention by local authorities have led Cuvee to believe that I betrayed him.
Therefore, he is sure to move the terminal to an undisclosed location.
Surveillance team intercepted an operations log indicating that an armored transport has been scheduled for a pick-up tomorrow afternoon.
We believe that's when they will be moving the terminal.
Sydney, you and Sark will intercept the convoy en route and bring the terminal back here safely.
If Sloane gets a hold of that terminal, well, the Alliance will be able to eavesdrop on corporations, law enforcement, political campaigns... the potential for blackmail and insider trading would be unlimited.
What's my counter-mission?
I'll have technical services provide you with a secure deletion program.
You'll upload it onto the Echelon terminal.
When SD-6 turns it on, it'll wipe the hard drive clean.
Sloane will think Cuvee installed a fail-safe to prevent...
SYDNEY AND Unauthorized access.
I'll do it on the return flight.
Sark and I are traveling separately to make sure no one can connect him to SD-6.
Oh, by the way, I'm meeting with Will tomorrow to help him prep for his psych evaluation.
Thank you.
And I like it.
What?
Your new suit.
Oh.
It's not new.
I just... don't wear it that often.
I came from a funeral.
Alice's father died.
I'm sorry.
How is she doing?
Okay.
Well, not really, but she'll be fine.
Let me know if you need anything.
Uh, Miss Bristow!
Uh, I know you have a plane to catch, but you mind doing a little favor for me?
Sure.
Uh, okay, will you take some snapshots around Paris with that for me?
Uh, you know, we have to maintain our cover for our loved ones and, well, my mom thinks I run global IT services for the bank so I like to composite myself into photographs for her.
Oh, I actually hae an example right here...
There's me and the sphinx!
Ha ha ha.
Of course,
I never actually left southern California but every once and a while I like to show my mom all the places I've never... really been to.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
Okay, have a safe trip.
I don't like to fly, personally.
But, uh, that's why I'm here and you're...
I've got some stuff to do.
Convoy's on the move.
ETA -- five minutes.
I'm right behind the truck.
Copy that.
I'm in position.
You know, it's a pity we're traveling separately.
We could've used the opportunity to get to know each other better.
Yeah, I'm broken up about that too.
You're surprisingly adept at keeping your curiosity in check.
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm referring to the fact that your mother and
I worked together before I arrived here -- before she... went into hiding.
I learned a lot from her.
In some ways,
I think of her as a mother myself.
Listen to me.
You and I have nothing in common.
We're not friends, we're not going to become friends, and you certainly won't bait me with stories about a woman I never knew.
I don't get any consideration at all for the fact that
I didn't tell Sloane you conspired to kill him?
We've covered this.
You can't expose me without exposing yourself.
Now, I'm almost into the city's traffic control network.
Get your head into the game.
How are your wounds healing?
You obviously had the chance to betray us in Kashmir, but you didn't.
I don't imagine that means you've decided to trust me?
Our previous... dealings would indicate that your strategy here may be long-term.
So for now, I trust that your behavior is predictable.
By "previous dealings" you mean our marriage?
You know, technically, we may still be husband and wife.
I'm sorry.
Sydney's on assignment with Sark.
It's my belief that he's still working for you, that you've coordinated your efforts to infiltrate both SD-6 and the CIA.
Whatever you have in mind, I promise you, it won't work.
So I'm going to offer you a deal.
I'll see to it that you're relocated to a private residence on Puget Sound, under twenty-four hour surveillance, of course.
But the illusion of freedom is better than none at all.
In exchange?
In exchange, you'll confess, tell us what you're really doing here, why you've turned yourself in.
I'll give you time to consider my offer.
I see you.
I'm turning the intersection to red.
It is two-for-one day here at Marshall's Tech Emporium.
Not only is this magnetic shape charge capable of penetrating two meters of armored steel, but act now, it will also come equipped with a secondary tear gas munition which will disable the guards inside the truck.
Operators standing by.
Hello!
I'm moving in to disable the escort car.
Copy that.
Police!
Police!
It's empty.
The terminal's not there.
The truck's a decoy.
Get in the car!
I got your message.
Yes, Jack, come in.
I want you to meet someone.
Jack Bristow, this is Ariana Kane
Kane is the head of Alliance counterintelligence.
She is the one who plugged the leak last year at SD-9.
Impressive work.
Particularly considering the guilty party attempted to frame you as the mole.
Men always call women crazy when they're caught with their pants down.
Ms. Kane is here to investigate the events leading up to Emily's disappearance and the subsequent attempts to blackmail me.
How much have you shared with him?
He knows everything I know.
I'm aware of your reputation as a first-class strategist,
Agent Bristow.
Tell me, where would you begin this investigation?
With me.
Over the years Arvin's trusted me with everything I'd need to know to be the perpetrator.
And if his standing within the Alliance were undermined,
I'd be a candidate to inherit his seat.
Motive.
Well, that's a hell of an answer.
In addition to being true, it's the only thing you can say to diminish your viability as a suspect.
Not really.
Your obvious awareness of game theory would invalidate my approach.
Therefore, the best course of action for me to make as a suspect is to simply tell the truth.
Well, as soon as you've officially eliminated the possibility of Agent Bristow as a suspect, I'm sure he'll be quite happy to assist you in your investigation.
Of course.
If you'll excuse me.
A pleasure.
All mine.
You ever have a dream where you're back at school and they won't let you graduate because you failed a test?
I had that last night.
Well, we don't screen for general knowledge.
It's strictly a psych profile.
So I can't fail but I can find out I'm a sociopath.
Yeah.
Listen, some of the questions on the test may seem a little shocking.
Shocking, how?
No, like, things you might punch someone out at a bar for asking.
I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but, um, if things go my way, what's next?
Well, you're cleared to read classified documents and you get a government salary.
Which isn't much.
Compared to what I make now it's... much.
Oh, and just be honest because if you're caught in a lie, you're automatically disqualified.
And since we don't know how often SD-6 keeps tabs on you, it's too risky to take the test at a federal building.
So we've arranged for you to go to one of our operational fronts.
Now when you get there, the officer will lead you in the back room where you'll take the test.
He'll tell you the shipping manifest was lost in transit and he needs your help to ID the parcel.
He'll take you in the back room and that's where you'll take the test.
Now, there's no time limit but it shouldn't take you more than an hour.
I can't believe some of the questions they asked.
Like, if forced to choose, who would you rather kill.
A) Your mother.
B) Your father.
C) Yourself.
And "none of the above" wasn't even an option.
I mean, what the hell does that measure?
How you see yourself in relation to authority.
Basically whether or not you'd be willing to sacrifice your life for your country.
Now that makes sense.
By the way, I got Francie season tickets to The Hollywood Bowl for her birthday from the both of us.
Oh, great, thank you.
You know, she was right about what she said.
We used to tell each other everything, now we don't.
I can't tell her anything.
I know.
I hate it, too.
But after Danny and what happened to you,
I've accepted the fact that it's as a gesture of love to deceive the people I care about.
What?
Hey, what are you doing here?
Rita, right?
Alice, hi.
Hi.
Hey, Rita.
Hey.
This is Will.
Hey.
Hey.
Michael.
Nice to meet you.
Michael, nice to meet you.
Hi.
Alice.
Hey.
Michael and I work together at the state department.
Oh.
Great.
I was so sorry to hear about your dad.
Oh, thank you.
Michael's been amazing.
He's...
He's an amazing guy.
Oh, Rita, we're going to be late.
We got to go meet some friends.
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's no problem.
It was nice running in to you guys.
You, too.
Bye.
See you.
The Echelon access terminal that you retrieved in Paris was rigged with a boot sector fail-safe.
When we turned it on, the hard drive was erased.
The good news is that Mr. Cuvee is no longer in possession of the terminal.
The bad news is that he may still have a way to access Echelon.
One of Cuvee's men placed a call to a data storage facility in London.
This facility caters to high-end corporate clients.
It's likely Cuvee duplicated the Echelon software and had them stored in a secure server there.
If he did, he could use them to reverse engineer a new terminal there.
Sydney, you'll acquire the files and delete them from Cuvee's back-up server.
Mr. Sark has provided Marshall with tech specs on the data storage facility.
Actually, um, yeah, actually, about that, the, uh, the facility is wired with electronic countermeasures and the computer's secured via military-grade encryption.
So any decryption device or radio contact would be detected so the only way the terminal can be accessed is by someone who knows how to crack polymorphic algorithms.
My math skills may be above average but
I can't do advanced calculus in my head.
That's why you're going in with Marshall.
Marshall who?
Wait a minute.
What?
You're the only one qualified to hack the server without the aid of an electronic device.
B-But I'm, uh, I can't go because I'm not field rated.
So...
You will be by the time you leave.
Sark will help you review the operational parameters and
I'm sure Sydney will take very good care of you.
We got your debrief.
If Marshall succeeds in copying those system files Sloane will be able to reboot the Echelon terminal.
Marshall has a photographic memory.
Once the files flash across the screen, he'll remember them.
Yes.
We know that.
I can't just give SD-6 a fake Marshall.
No, but we can pull him out of SD-6.
What?
Devlin made it clear that we cannot, under any circumstances, allow SD-6 to access Echelon.
And sabotaging the mission is too risky after Kashmir.
Sloane could start to suspect something.
We've considered every option, Syd, there's no othe way to do this.
When you and Marshall return from London, we'll take him into protective custody.
He'll be transported to Langley for an extensive debrief.
As ridiculous as this sounds, SD-6 is his whole life.
It's never easy finding out everything you believe in is a lie.
We'll do whatever we can to make it easier for him,
I promise.
And when he adjusts, he'll have the option to come work for us.
What about his mother?
Will they be able to make contact?
Well, that'll be up to Marshall but we can bring her into protective custody too.
What's my cover story with Sloane?
As far as you'll know, the mission went without a hitch and you separated at the airport.
We'll intercept Marshall on his way home.
I should pack.
Listen, um, about the bar...
Did you see the security camera?
Yeah, we sent an agent to pull the tapes so we couldn't be tied together.
Good.
Alice seems really nice.
She said the same thing about you.
How long have you known Arvin Sloane?
For thirty years.
When we met, he as my superior at the CIA.
Yes, and once he left the CIA, he invited you to work with him at SD-6?
Yes.
We were both disillusioned with the US government.
We'd both come to see it as corrupt and we believed then, as we do now, that the Alliance would ultimately succeed in achieving global dominance.
You and Sloane have been so close all these years, why do you imagine he recruited your daughter into
SD-6 without telling you?
Because he knew I would've been opposed to it.
Trust... doesn't come easily to Arvin Sloane so while at the time,
I may not have approved I now accept that he recruited
Sydney to ensure that he'd never have to take my loyalty on faith.
You're asking me to believe that Sloane took your daughter hostage to ensure your friendship?
In our line of work we can't just cry foul when things don't go our way.
With whom have you had intimate contact over the past ten years, Agent Bristow?
I-I'm curious to know where you're going with this.
More secrets have been revealed through pillow talk than through torture.
If there's a prostitute or a stewardess out there you think may have heard you talking in your sleep,
I need to know about it.
There is one way for you to verify if my nocturnal activities are a security risk, Ms. Kane, but somehow I think we'd both prefer the torture.
Oooh!
What happened to that gentleman
I met in Sloane's office this morning?
He got tired of your baseless accusations.
Good.
I don't trust anyone who doesn't have the sense to know when he's being insulted.
Are we through?
Yes.
For now.
APU -- set.
Aft cargo heat -- set.
Hydraulic pumps -- set.
Marshall.
What are you doing?
Oh, I, uh, patched into the inflight phone network and logged into the onboard computer.
I just want to make sure the pilots don't miss anything in preflight checklist.
What was that!
That's the flaps extending...
totally routine, totally routine...
Is this really your first time on a plane?
Yeah.
I couldn't sleep last night so I memorized the
FAA 747 flight ops manual.
Just, uh, sorry.
Sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.
Marshall, you're sweating.
Yeah!
Maybe you should take your jacket off.
No!
No way.
Nooooo waaaaay.
I compressed a high glide tactical parachute in the lining of my jacket.
Just in case.
Don't worry, though.
My belt hyperextends into a tandem sling.
Just loop it around your waist, it'll hold us both.
Thanks.
You don't have to thank me.
It's, uh, it's my job to keep you safe.
What was that!
That's not a plane sound!
That could be bad!
Marshall...
Oh.
A little kid playing...
Dee dee dee dee!
Is that all right?
Is he allowed?
Onboard play--you're not supposed to...
Sorry, can I get a ginger ale?
I don't think I've ever seen you look quite so handsome, my darling.
And you look lovely, my dear.
Shall we?
We shall.
Whoa.
This is...
SO cool.
Hey, how's it going?
Good to see you.
Hey, how's it going?
Hey.
How you doing?
Hey, uh, nice to see you.
The key to doing this right -- be inconspicuous.
Right.
Sorry.
I just, uh, I didn't...
Hey, how's it going?
You don't have to say hi to everybody.
I'm sorry, I think I know her.
Shh.
Box seats have been reserved for you at Royal Hall behind this man.
Thatcher Powell, Cuvee's head of IT security.
And the only man with access to his security server.
Powell attends the London philharmonic every third Saturday of the month and takes in the performance with a bottle of Cristal.
Um, you know, Bach is my favorite composer.
Are you speaking to me?
Yes.
I bet you didn't know that the last piece of music that Bach ever composed, he encoded his name into the musical notes.
He certainly was the most ingenious composers of the Baroque movement.
You know what I always say -- If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it!
Pardon my husband, he does tend to prattle on.
Sorry.
Once Powell injests the scopolomene, it'll take effect in roughly five minutes.
The idea is to make Powell believe he merely fell asleep.
So the dose will be mild.
That means once you steal the access card, get across town to the server facility, download the Echelon software and return the key to the pocket before intermission, there will be a car waiting for you out front.
Psst!
Oh, thank goodness you're still open!
I'm Marie Robinson, this is my associate Frederick Fields.
Hallo.
We work for Jennings Aerospace.
The New York office just paged me at the symphony, our CFO's laptop was stolen, we need to access our backup server right away.
May I have your corporate PIN number, please?
86119.
You're on server thirteen, second floor.
Oh, thank you.
We won't be more than ten minutes.
Cheerio!
SD-6 has opened an account at the data storage facility under the name Jennings Aerospace.
Your client status will get you past the desk guard, and the security staff will be reduced for the nightshift.
Since Cuvee is justifiably paranoid, he's leased out the entire third floor as his own.
You will need to break into the third floor to access the server.
Syd, you were amazing!
You were acting, you're spying...
Ready to do your magic?
I'm ready for anything.
How did you get up here?
This area is restricted.
Sir, you're going to have to come with us.
Syd, I've been shot!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Syd, Syd, I've been shot!
I'm shot!
Oh, my God!
Marshall, Marshall...
Oh, my God!
Wait, it's just a tranq dart.
It's okay, I pulled it out before you got a full dose.
Thank God for the British and their anti-gun laws, right?
You're okay?
I'm okay, I'm okay.
What were you saying to those guards?
I think I said, "I can smell you from here" in Ewok.
Ewok.
Official language of the indigenous creatures on the planet Endor.
I think I... peed myself a little.
I mean, not a little just, like, a little... squirt.
Mashall, stay with me!
Stay with me!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I just, I got a little...
Let's walk.
I can walk.
Okay, okay, hang on, hang on.
There.
Hang on.
Okay.
Three!
Okay, stay awake, stay awake, come on, stay awake, stay awake...
Marshall, focus.
I love youuuu.
Oh!
The Echelon software is on this computer.
You have to access it, I'll do the rest.
Okay, okay, okay, I got it.
I got it.
Go.
I got it.
It's all... good.
Marshall!
Hmm.
Mama?
Accounting for the relevant state during key generation in the crypto compiler combined with a pseudo random generator will give you a password.
Oh, Marshall, you're a genius! Thank you so much!
Ahem.
Goodness.
I-I must've dozed off.
Well, you certainly weren't the only one!
Huh?
So, this car will take you home.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, you think the driver will take the scenic route home?
I've got this unbelievable filmstrip running in my head.
The thing I still can't believe is that we're the stars.
I just want to watch it a couple of more times before I go back to my room.
Sure.
Hey, oh, at least I got some real pictures of London to show the folks back home now.
Marshall... see you soon, okay?
Okay.
Hey, you know the best part?
I've never been prouder to be one of the good guys.
Yeah, Mom, I'll be home in a little while.
I'm just getting back from my big business trip to London!
And--yeah, Mom, of course they fed me on the plane.
I-I don't know, some sort of chicken or squid.
Wait, hold on a second.
Um, actually, can you make a left right here?
There's a nightclub I want to drive by and--
What's going on?
Surprise!
This is why you guys shut up when I walked into the room!
Gotcha.
Happy birthday.
Oh, I love you so.
Happy birthday, sweetie.
Oh, my God!
Jack Bristow is not the man responsible for blackmailing me.
His answers are too perfect.
I mean, he even gets angry when it makes strategic sense.
If he had nothing to do with it, I would expect his answers to be perfect.
Now, Ariana, unless you have evidence--
Contrary to what you tell your subordinates, we are not the US government.
I don't need probable cause to go after Bristow.
All I need is a hunch.
Well, your hunches notwithstanding, you're talking about a man with whom
I've been partnered for thirty years.
Yeah, well, you have a blind spot when it comes to him.
Look, he's not the first suspect I interviewed.
I talked to all the other heads of the SD cells.
People who might've taken issue with your promotion to the Alliance.
You know what I found?
They're all afraid of you.
Except for Jack Bristow, who I promise you, is hiding something.
Have you thought about my offer?
I have nothing to confess, Jack.
I know you find it hard to believe
I'd turn myself in to make up for my mistakes but that's the reason...
the only reason I'm here.
If that's the truth, why didn't you simply refuse the offer?
I was considering whether or not to fabricate a confession just to get out of this cell.
You were right.
Although our marital contract was founded on fraudulent pretenses, it's still valid until it's annulled.
Which means, technically, we are still married.
Jack.
Thus far, I've agreed to be debriefed only by Sydney.
From now on, I'm willing to talk to you, too.
Vaughn here.
What do you mean we didn't pick up Marshall at the intercept point, who did?
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God.
P-Please don't hurt me, Mister.
Mister, please.
Please don't hurt me.
P-Please...
Tell me, how did you enjoy the symphony?
Translation and subtitling:
The Subtitling Company
When did you notice that your patient, Jan Teugels, had escaped ?
Not till this morning.
His cell door was forced open and my car was gone.
Did he know he was going to be transferred to a secure unit ?
Hello, Mr Verwey.
- Hello.
Our psychopath has been kind enough to save the taxpayer a lot of money.
I'm warning you, there's not much left.
Wonderful.
Here you are.
Could you stand still so I can film you ?
It's for our diary.
O.K. Great.
Now some kissing.
Perfect, thanks.
Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
- Yeah, bye.
Mark will be jealous when he sees that.
He doesn't need any pictures, he's jealous anyway.
He thinks I'm having an affair with my supplier.
With Patrick ?
But he's 95.
- Yeah, I know.
Did you get them ?
Criminals caught on tapecoming up after the commercial break.
Look at her !
She might just as well be nude.
Mustn't forget Mark.
No, he deserves something, too.
Hello, Laryssa.
We've missed you.
I'm just going to get some cigarettes.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
What's it like being self-employed ?
- I give people what they want.
I'm hot.
You could open a window.
You're worth looking at.
I want to make love.
Is the bell tower round here somewhere ?
Miss, show a bit of tact, please.
Eva.
I thought it was you lying there.
Found them.
Suicide caught on tape.
I've never seen anyone die.
Neither have I.
Bloody hell.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I believe this is yours.
Yes, thanks.
Sorry ...
Thanks.
Eva Brandt.
Pleased to meet you.
Dieter Bakker.
Me too.
Fancy going for a drink or something ?
Do you live here ?
- No.
Do you ?
- No.
Well, she certainly doesn't.
Neither do I.
- But you work here ?
Sorry.
Mother ?
D'you want me to go ?
What about Mark ?
Mothers.
Always think of their sons as little boys.
I'm going home.
I've got lots to do.
Where do you live ?
- Nieuwpoort.
Nieuwpoort ?
Nice marina.
Do you know Nieuwpoort marina ?
- Yes.
My mum's got a boat.
We often go sailing at the weekend.
So we get to see places.
- Nieuwpoort for example.
For example.
I'm joining the traffic jam.
- Must you go now ?
Bye, Dieter.
- Bye, Patti.
Bye, Eva.
He's got a nice bum.
She's nice, your friend.
Is your boyfriend nice, too?
He thinks he is.
My bag's in the way.
- Let's put it in the car.
Come on.
Come on.
Christ, you're an amateur.
Got it.
Let's get out of here !
What time is your train ?
- Half an hour ago.
Shame.
Shit.
Maybe the camera wasn't on ?
- Of course it was.
The bitches have changed the tape.
This would-be Jean-Claude Van Damme lives in Wallonia.
In Vresse-sur-Semois.
Know it ?
- In the Ardennes, I suppose.
The Ardennes ?
Sounds interesting.
And out of the way.
- What are you thinking about ?
A holiday.
But how are we going to get there ?
- By car, of course.
Have we got a car ?
Shall I take you to the station ?
- No, that's OK.
I insist.
My mother taught me good manners.
Bloody hell.
Sorry about your car.
Sorry about your camera.
I should've put it in the boot.
Stupid of me.
I'll take you home.
- You really don't have to.
It's no trouble.
And then I'll know the way.
Handy.
Look at that.
That nutter lives in a nuthouse.
We won't find anything here.
- Use your loaf !
How do they keep all the lunatics calm ?
Straightjackets ?
- No, pills.
Dope.
Dope.
You're mad !
- Yeah, I shall be well received.
This is where we say we had a nice time.
Exchange phone numbers and then forget each other.
Usually they've already had sex by then.
Have I still got that to come ?
Maybe.
It was a pleasure, Dieter Bakker.
The pleasure was all mine, Eva Brandt.
Mother ?
Did you really have to look as if you were lusting after that prick ?
That prick pays us money.
- To look after his boat.
When he feels the pain of the bill we'll make sure he comes back again.
The richer they are, the less they spend.
That's how come they're rich.
Business smile.
Here it is.
There's enough demazepan for all the addicts in Ghent.
Prozac, 85 mg.
- 85 mg ?
Can't get that anywhere.
I told you, only the best for the loonies.
Here, for your future depression.
Ketamine.
- Fantastic.
It's heavy stuff.
- Come on, give here.
I've always wanted to try it.
- Don't be daft.
You're mad.
Idiot.
Carlo ?
Carlo ?
Carlo, that's enough.
Over here.
Hello.
Are you here on your own ?
- Together with ten or so patients.
But they are all locked up.
I'm here with my mate.
- He won't come round for a while.
And when he does come round, he'll have an enormous erection.
It's great.
You ought to try it.
What have you come here for ?
- To steal.
And rape.
D'you enjoy that ?
- Yes.
So do I.
Cool.
Your mate's enjoying himself too.
What I don't understand ... is that a woman on her own ... with all those dangerous lunatics ... isn't armed.
As long as your weapon is loaded.
Mine certainly is.
Why did you really come here ?
Who gave you this address ?
Well Eva, did you enjoy yourself in Ghent ?
It seems he had a nice bum, so Patti tells me.
Tinne, nothing happened.
But we came close.
- I believe you.
But Mark isn't so trusting.
Was it bad ?
When Patti returned without you he wasn't very happy.
He drank a whole bottle of whisky.
Well, Stef was kind enough to help him.
You could've rung.
Mark and I are just good friends.
Friends who have sex.
But we're not married, we don't live together.
Even though that's what Mark seems to want.
I'll ring you, OK ?
She doesn't know what she does want.
Maybe.
But she does know what she doesn't want.
Shit.
Come on.
Mustn't forget Mark.
No, he deserves something, too.
Is the bell tower round here somewhere ?
Is the bell tower round here somewhere ?
Is it normal to spend the night with some bloke she met in the street ?
Someone she didn't know.
While I wait at home like an idiot.
Like an idiot ?
- That's it, you go ahead and laugh.
Jesus Christ.
She's nothing but a slut !
If she thinks she can sleep around, so be it.
But without me.
Because it's over.
Finished.
What is it ?
Damn.
Sorry, Mark.
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
We talked and danced.
I missed my train and he drove me home.
That's all.
Honestly.
Will I see you this evening ?
I'm dead tired.
Tomorrow maybe.
Was it your turn to stay up all night ?
How are things ?
I don't know.
I really don't know, Patti.
What did Mark say ?
- Things aren't too good.
Has Dieter got something to do with it ?
I'm not a stupid teenager any more.
If things were perfect with Mark there wouldn't be a problem.
True.
Dieter has, of course, got a lovely bum.
What should I do ?
In the magazines they say follow your heart.
But they are written by frustrated women with kids ... and a bloke who's having an affair with his secretary.
So if they have to follow their heart they buy a gun ... and next day they're headline news.
I'm not asking the magazines, I'm asking you.
I'm 29, divorced and I sleep with a computer.
You're asking the wrong person.
- Come on, Patti.
Mark is ... like a Volvo.
It's not an exciting car, but it's reliable and keeps going.
OK ?
Apart from that, do what you want to do.
D'you want to see your tape ?
Musn't forget Mark.
No, he deserves something, too.
Is the bell tower round here somewhere ?
What d'you think ?
Suicide ?
Why get undressed and then jump out of the window ?
Surely you don't think it was murder ?
I get the impression she wasn't alone.
It looks like she's talking to someone.
Her killer.
It's just a theory.
- In broad daylight ?
Hello, Steven.
Endlich.
Quay C. OK.
I'll do that.
Bye.
A new job.
A yacht has just arrived.
Miss Patti.
Aren't you pleased to see me ?
Do I make you feel unsafe ?
Idiot.
Brandt Daughter Yacht maintenance
Captain ?
Anyone there ?
Is the bell tower round here somewhere ?
Miss, show a bit of tact, please.
A bit of tact, please.
Dieter ?
- In person.
Cross ?
- A bit.
Pleased ?
A bit more.
May I ?
I'll have it dry-cleaned.
- Not necessary.
Expenses.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
You've got red cheeks.
- It's hot in here.
We could go for a swim.
I haven't got my swimsuit with me.
Is that necessary ?
Hi, Patti.
What ?
Are you sure ?
Yes, I'm on my way.
Have you got something to tell me ?
You knew that girl who jumped out of the window.
I want to go back to the harbour.
Carry on.
Her name is ...
Her name was ...
Laryssa Varenberg.
She was in a psychiatric hospital, Le Vallon.
She was suicidal.
My mother looked after her for a while.
One day, against my mother's advice, she was discharged.
She was supposedly cured.
I went to look for her and found her in Ghent.
So yes, I was with her when she jumped.
Jumped ?
- Of course she jumped.
What did you think ?
Mustn't forget Mark.
No, he deserves something, too.
Is the bell tower round here somewhere ?
I was there to help her.
I wanted to persuade her to go back.
She couldn't live without medication.
Then she wanted to make love.
In the hospital we'd made love a couple of times.
She was still in love with me.
She took her clothes off.
And what did you do then ?
Nothing.
Suddenly ... she looked at me, with empty eyes.
She turned round and without saying a word she jumped.
Miss Patti, what can I do for you ?
During the summer holiday the buildings shut at 5 p.m.
Personnel are supposed to leave the buildings at this time.
Anyone here after that time may be regarded as an intruder ... and treated as such.
Customers.
Shouldn't you wave your truncheon ?
Silly cow.
Miss, show a bit of tact, please.
Can you rewind it ?
Can you zoom in on this man ?
He was sitting next to me on the bench.
He undressed Laryssa with his eyes.
And then he was gone.
Dieter, who's that ?
Dieter, answer me.
Who's that man ?
I think we should call the police.
That man is my father.
He's a dentist at the hospital.
He had an affair with Laryssa.
So she swaps the father for the son and out of jealousy ... the father pushes her out of the window.
No, I just wanted to help her.
- By screwing her ?
She had a history of suicide.
- That doesn't prove a thing.
What happened in that apartment ?
Laryssa was blackmailing my father.
She may have been ill and unstable ... but she knew that doctors weren't supposed to sleep with patients.
I wanted to help my father, get her to change her mind.
I didn't know he would be there and when she saw us together ...
I think she wanted to punish us and jumped.
Why didn't you wait for the police to arrive ?
Because I panicked.
I was in a state of shock.
Can you imagine the scandal ?
Even if we were proved innocent, my father would be ruined.
The hospital closed, my mother's life's work destroyed.
I dragged him out of there and I'm not sorry.
Thanks.
Hello, Patti Willaert.
Ghent police, please.
Are you coming ?
Laryssa and me, that's in the past.
It's about us, now.
Dieter, someone died and you might be involved.
I don't know you.
You suddenly appeared in my life.
Things are going too fast.
That's just it.
Follow your heart.
I need time.
Sorry.
I'll be here until tomorrow morning.
Shit.
Eva, there's something you should know.
I've phoned the police.
You shouldn't have done that.
- The case has been filed.
Suicide.
No trace of a break-in, no trace of violence.
Laryssa was a high-class prostitute.
She had a history of mental health problems.
She went from one hospital to another.
She even jumped from the second floor in one place.
And the tape, did you say anything about that ?
No, not if you don't want me to.
He's telling the truth.
And yet ...
Hello, mother.
- Hello, son.
My film debut.
I could win an Oscar.
She probably kept a copy.
- Can something be done about it ?
Yes.
Permanently.
- That's the way, son.
Hi, darling.
- Jesus.
You frightened me.
Did you enjoy yourself ?
I'd rather you phoned first.
- Did you enjoy yourself ?
Mark, now isn't the time.
- Ah, now isn't the time.
But it is the time to visit this snob, this daddy's boy ...
Mummy's boy.
The bloke who arrived with his yacht.
- To have it overhauled.
To overhaul you.
- Maybe I need overhauling, too.
I want my keys back.
- You are not to see him again.
He's leaving tomorrow morning.
- That's a day late.
You are pushing me into his arms.
Can't you see that ?
You want to go to him.
You want to.
O.K. then, go.
Come on.
Go.
Go on.
Go forth and multiply.
Damn you.
Damn you.
Stupid bloody idiot, frightening me like that !
I hoped you'd come.
I wanted to help her.
- We should call the police.
Can you imagine the scandal ?
- What happened ?
I panicked, I was in a state of shock.
Come on, Eva, answer the phone.
Stupid cow.
Where's Eva ?
- Gone fishing.
Patsy, aren't you going to stay for a drink ?
That works out well.
The Endlich is the large brown boat at the end.
Did you bring me something ?
O.K. then.
Hello.
Are you staying on the boat ?
Were you here last night ?
Did you hear anything ?
- Nothing in particular.
The young lady didn't either ?
We were both rather tired, if you get my meaning.
It's clear enough.
It rained last night.
The quay was wet.
She probably slipped, hit her head, fell into the water and drowned.
You knew the deceased ?
Were you expecting her ?
- Why should we ?
We'd seen her a bit earlier.
I also spoke to her on the phone.
I'm sorry.
My condolences.
Here's the number of Victim Support, if you want to talk ...
That's kind of you.
Thank you.
My best friend is dead.
Mother, I can't find my ...
I've lost ...
Yes, but, ...
O.K.
Is the bell tower round here somewhere ?
Miss, show a bit of tact, please.
Hello.
- I'd like to rent a car.
We're only a small firm.
You have to book in advance.
Sorry.
You don't think you could, just this once ... make an exception in my case ?
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
Eva Brandt, I'd like to speak to Dr De Decker.
Come in.
It's Patti.
She was found this morning.
And Eva, where's Eva ?
- She left a couple of hours ago.
And Dieter ?
- He left a bit later.
How ?
How ?
- On foot, by car ?
For God's sake.
He rented a car.
Hello, Eva.
Sir, I can't tell you that.
Surely you understand.
Calm down.
Ignorant pig.
I'm calling the manager.
You can talk to him.
For goodness sake.
Vresse-sur-Semois.
Was it such a problem ?
So, Eva.
What did you want to ask ?
Who's this ?
And what has he got to do with Dieter ?
Dieter is ill, isn't he ?
You're almost family now, so you've got a right ... how shall I put it, to know the family history.
That's Jan Teugels, when he was 16.
He killed his parents and grandparents with a hammer ... because he wasn't allowed to watch the football on the TV.
It was an important match.
- The European Cup.
The final.
I saw immediately that he was special.
And he never disappointed me.
But who is Dieter then ?
A while ago a public servant remembered Jan should be assessed.
According to the assessment he had to be transferred to a secure unit.
They said we couldn't do any more for him, the amateurs.
I couldn't allow that.
Not Jan. Not my Jan.
Dieter was just a poor lunatic here.
Too good for prison, too bad to be allowed out.
Just right for us.
Just before Jan was transferred to prison, Dieter had an accident.
A terrible accident.
A fatal accident.
And Albert was so inept, he made a mistake when identifying the body.
Jan Teugels is officially dead but Dieter is alive and well.
The Alias is dead, long live the Alias.
This is where Jan stayed for a while, before he came to live with us.
Dieter.
- Jan.
Do you like salmon ?
Vresse-sur-Semois.
Pardon ?
I can't hear you properly, Luc.
Ring Marcel De Smet, my friend in the police.
And Laryssa, who was that ?
- Ah, the beautiful Laryssa.
Yvonne, please.
Albert has a good time with the patients when they are tranquillised.
But Laryssa, she enjoyed it, even without tranquillisers.
Didn't she, Albert ?
Then Albert was a bit reckless and set her up in an apartment.
He liked that, a woman he could shag without tranquillisers.
A mistress.
Just like a real man.
Eh, darling ?
I don't care what he does with the loonies.
We've got an agreement.
But letting someone like that out, that's dangerous.
Laryssa was a risk.
I don't like risks.
Am I in time for dinner ?
Did you love her, Laryssa ?
And what about Dieter's family ?
- Dieter hasn't got any family.
The people who come here don't have family any more.
The most they have is a file.
Psychiatry is the modern equivalent ... of the oubliette.
It's not easy for Albert.
Albert is a loser.
Don't forget he gave you a new life.
And he's the only one who can testify to that.
And now he wants to leave us.
That can be taken care of.
Can it ?
Why do you let all those awful things happen ?
Because Albert enjoys playing with the patients.
Boys or girls.
Young or old.
He doesn't mind.
He's not choosy.
Are you, Albert ?
Come on, I'll show you my room.
I love my mother a lot.
- Except that she's not your mother.
To me she is.
She taught me everything.
Everything.
And she taught me well.
Don't you agree ?
You know what you've got to do.
- It's all going wrong, Yvonne.
Once more and then you can leave.
It's been good.
We've had a good time.
You with Laryssa and me with Jan.
And Jan with Eva.
And don't forget to put your boots on.
Didn't you bring anything decent to wear ?
Shame.
Here we usually dress for dinner.
Did you enjoy it, son ?
Yes, mother.
We enjoyed it very much.
There's something I've got to do before dinner.
Come when you're ready.
You're just in time.
Hello son.
Have you taken your pills ?
- They're all gone.
Again.
Shall I go and play the psycho ?
- You do that, son.
And shut the door behind you.
It's raining.
Managing O.K. ?
Where's your girlfriend ?
- Indoors with Yvonne.
With Yvonne ?
I don't share with anyone, Albert.
- I know you don't.
And now you're after Eva.
You're mad.
Completely mad.
- No doubt about it.
Oh yes, do you like salmon ?
Or have I already asked you ?
Well.
Enjoy your meal.
Busy, busy, busy.
Go on, son.
D'you know you are really special ?
You're the only woman I screwed twice.
Except for my mother, of course.
Doesn't that create a bond between us ?
What d'you reckon ?
Are we meant for each other ?
You and me ?
For ever ?
Ungrateful bitch.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- It's O.K. It's O.K.
We've got to get out of here as quickly as possible.
Easy, easy.
Mark, watch out !

Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
- Thank you.
- OK.
All right.
Thanks, Judge.

Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.

Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.

I need visa.
Where's your green form?

Go to the wall.

Sir.
The light green form.
I love New York...

I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.

- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.

I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.

He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.

We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.

You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...

Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...

I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
Viktor.
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh...
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
...the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
...reijoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
Your attention please.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm...
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
There's something you should know.
Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines Flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate.
For those passengers holding tickets for Flight 866 to Krakozhia, we expect departure to be on schedule.
Get back, please.
Gupta.
Gupta!
I am going home.
Get lost.
Your attention, please.
Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be delayed until further notice.
Do you have an appointment?
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on down there!
We're right behind you.
Viktor's leaving.
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know.
He's going home.
He's going for the front door, out to the city.
What?
Viktor.
Remember us.
From the Discovery Store, I want to give you this.
It's good luck.
A digital camera for cousin Katia.
I don't know where you're going, but these will keep your feet warm.
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.
Secure the door.
Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
Those are the entry doors to New York City.
To the United States of America.
Turn around.
It's snowing in the city and you're going to need that.
Good luck.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No, no.
I'm going to miss you.
Try not to get stuck wherever you're going.
Arrest him!
Arrest him!
Goddammit!
Taxi!
Thank you.
Where you go?
161 Lexington.
Please take Van Wyck Expressway to Queensboro Bridge.
It's faster than BQE.
- Where you from?
- Krakozhia.
Viktor Navorski.
I'm Goran.
Albania.
- When do you come to New York?
- Thursday.
You want us to block the south exit and have AP sweep every vehicle?
Sir?
5.30 from Tokyo just landed.
Got two planes on the tarmac.
Barcelona on approach.
The night is young and 1500 people are headed our way.
Everybody inside.
Everybody inside.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
- Are you checking in, sir?
- No, no.
I don't check in.
I want to go to this place, please.
The lobby lounge is around the corner.
They have happy hour specials and live music.
Do you like jazz?
The monitor's off.
The piano's OK.
A little more bass.
More bass from the monitor.
Let's do Killer Joe.
It worked all right last night.
- Yes?
- You are Benny Golson?
Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Benny Golson, I am Viktor Navorski.
I am from Krakozhia.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, was great, great fan of your music.
A jazz fan.
Fantastic.
Would you sign your name, please?
Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.
- Just a minute.
- I will wait.
OK.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Where you want to go?
I am going home.
[Fast-paced dramatic music]
DISPATCHER [Over radio]:
DOC 3123, come back.
TOMMY:
This is DOC 3123.
DISPATCHER:
We have your weather update.
Chance of flurries at higher elevations.
Supposed to clear by midnight.
Over.
TOMMY:
We're in some weather here near Bellevue Pass.
We'll be running late.
Over.
dispatcher:
Affirmative, 3123.
Will advise.
Why didn't we stay at Mt.
Butte instead of trying to drive through this?
-Chance of flurries, my ass.
-It's not like we planned it this way.
Besides, we got orders.
Orders is orders.
Trouble is, I think this mess is turning into a blizzard.
-Yeah, meets all the criteria.
-Criteria?
Yeah.
To be a blizzard, certain very specific criteria have to be met.
-Like what, lots of snow?
-Yeah.
Plus you got to have winds of over 45 miles per hour... temperature below 10 degrees, and visibility has to be below 500 feet.
-How do you know this?
-Weather Channel.
I still don't see why getting some dirt bag to Death Row Randolph's so important.
RED:
It's not important.
It's only orders.
RED:
You want some?
TOMMY:
No, thank you, sir.
Told you before to call me Red.
You know, maybe I will take a cup.
Pal!
Look out!
[Officers groan]
-You okay?
-Yeah.
-Sorry, I think I hit--
-As long as no one's hurt.
RED:
You okay back there?
JACK:
Yeah, just great.
[Car engine turns over]
Attention, State Police, this is State Vehicle 3123...
Department of Corrections.
Come in.
Over.
This is State Vehicle 3123.
Come in.
Over.
Attention, State Police.
Do you read me?
Over.
Come on, come on.
I repeat, do you read me?
Over.
TOMMY:
Nothing.
-It's weird.
-So what're we going to do?
We can't stay here, not in this weather.
TOMMY:
All right, convict, we're going on a little nature hike.
I get any funny business, I'm going to put one through your skull.
Tommy, please.
Things are hard enough, don't you think?
[Children laughing]
HANNAH:
Got you.
STEPHEN:
Did not.
STEPHEN:
Did not.
Did not.
HANNAH:
Did, too.
Did, too.
gloria:
Hey, Garrett.
gloria:
Busy night.
GARRETT:
Where'd they all come from?
gloria:
Got me.
DEL:
Hey, Garrett.
Coffee?
GARRETT:
Please.
-Del, did you plough the strip?
-Twice.
Once this morning and again at around 4:00.
I even put salt down the second time.
It's still looking pretty crazy out there.
It's really coming down.
Will you be able to take off in this weather?
-Excuse me.
You the pilot?
-I am.
What can I do for you?
Get us out of here.
We're booked on the 10:15 out of O'Hare... but my wife decided to slip in a few extra runs, we missed the bus.
It's always my fault.
I'm not assigning blame.
And it had nothing to do with you drinking all afternoon with that woman.
I told you that she was a rep from Midwestern and nothing was going on.
Nothing like last time?
Sir, ma'am, excuse me.
We've filed a flight plan.
Scheduled departure is still set for 45 minutes.
But whether we take off or not depends on the storm.
So we might be grounded?
We might not leave at all?
Yes, sir, there is a chance.
That's unacceptable.
I have a business meeting in Seattle tomorrow.
Excuse me.
Do you know who I am?
I'm David Higgins, in the Fortune 500.
It's really not up to me, sir.
It's not up to you?
You're the pilot, right?
-Yes, but the FAA--
-Then you make the final decision.
Tell her.
I'm trying to tell her.
If it's a question of money--
The FAA has strict guidelines... designed to protect the health and safety of all passengers and crew.
They decide when we are able to take off and when we can't.
Kids.
-Got you.
-Did not.
-Did, too.
-Did not, did not.
ANDREW:
Kids!
Can't you see we're trying to have an adult conversation here?
Andrew.
We're on an indefinite hold because of the weather.
We don't know when we'll be able to take off.
Is that clear?
REVEREND:
Ma'am?
gloria:
Yes?
If you'd point me in the direction of the men's room I'd be obliged.
GARRETT:
It's through those doors.
REVEREND:
Bless you.
Will you take a look at this?
Sorry to bother you, ladies, but we have a situation.
We were in the process of transporting this prisoner up north... when our vehicle was disabled down the road.
We're going to need a place to hole up until our relief unit arrives.
gloria:
Here?
Him?
TOMMY:
Afraid so.
I'm not sure we have any facility to handle prisoners, Officer.
GARRETT:
What exactly did he do?
TOMMY:
He's a murderer, ma'am.
I'm not sure we should have a murderer here with the passengers.
We can handle him, ma'am.
It's what we do.
I'm afraid we have no choice in the matter.
If I could just make a call?
gloria:
The phone lines have been down for an hour now.
-Do you have a CB, or a backup radio?
-Nothing's working.
This is ridiculous.
Just point us at a back room, we'll get out of your hair, and you get back to work.
-Del.
-Yeah, I can show them something.
I got to take a leak.
-Much obliged.
-Yeah, we're right back here, gentlemen.
Try something, you won't have to wait for the chair.
I'll fry your ass right here.
You going to watch or hold?
[Toilet flushes]
Check it out.
TOMMY:
Hello, Padre.
It's Reverend, Officer.
I'm a simple preacher.
I didn't know who that was back there.
The men's room is very much like a house of God in that, in its confines... all men are welcome.
That's a good one, Reverend.
REVEREND:
And who is this?
RED:
Prisoner.
In the process of transfer, we hit some ice, skidded off the road.
-A felon?
-He don't play well with others, sir.
I will say a prayer for his soul.
Show some respect.
All can be forgiven, if one acknowledges his wicked deeds.
Afraid my list of wicked deeds is too long.
-Shall I hear your confession?
-Say what?
RED:
That won't be necessary, Reverend.
Saving souls is always necessary.
Would you like to confess, my son?
-You're not a priest.
-No, sir.
I'm a humble preacher.
Only priests hear confession.
Who are you?
Now, son.
Perhaps you should show us some lD, Reverend.
REVEREND:
Certainly, Officer.
My mistake.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Where I come from, convict, hitting a holy man is a grave offence.
Yeah?
Where is that?
Some place far, far away.
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Taking over.
-Why?
-Because we don't like you.
[Gunshots]
-Were those gunshots?
-Of course they were.
What do you think?
You, what're you waiting for?
Get in there!
Do something.
That crazy-ass con gets out here, he's going to smoke us all.
[Fast-paced dramatic music plays]
[Steam hisses from pipe]
[Unearthly bubbling]
DEL:
Drop it!
I said, drop it!
Don't.
No!
Please, don't hurt him.
He's just doing his job.
-Are we done?
-Yeah.
-Hey!
-Don't shoot me!
I'm not a hero.
I'm not a hero.
Get back down there.
Everybody else, back to the seats.
You, too.
-Can we talk?
-No.
STEPHEN:
You cheated!
HANNAH:
No, you got in front of me.
STEPHEN:
No!
HANNAH:
You got a head start.
JACK:
Hey!
You, get those kids.
We were just playing.
SARAH:
It's okay, honey, I think he's just tired or something.
-Tell me something.
-What?
What's your name?
-Darian.
-Darian.
-What kind of name is that?
-It's my name.
-What, you don't like my name, now?
-Tell me something, Darian... who got off the call to the cops?
-Nobody.
-Who called them?
-I ain't seen nobody call nobody, man.
-Are you lying to me?
I'm lying, I'm dying.
I know the drill, dog.
We tried.
The landlines are out.
Try yourself.
Yeah, listen to the lady, man.
Go on, try them.
Cell phones don't work here, either.
[No dial tone from phone]
You killed those men, didn't you?
You don't have to worry about who I killed last, only who I'll kill next.
Give me your cell phone.
[Cell phone beeping]
SGT.
GRlFFlN:
The bathroom, sir.
JACK:
What's that?
If those men are still alive, it'll go a long way in your favour if we tried to help them.
Nobody who walked in there is ever coming out.
[Angie sobs]
angle:
Son of a bitch.
You animal.
You.
david:
Me?
JACK:
Yeah.
What size shoes you wear?
david:
Eleven.
JACK:
Take them off.
Pardon?
-Sir, where's your luggage?
-It's right there.
GARRETT:
There.
You want clothes?
There, you got clothes.
You a fancy boy?
Lots of pretty clothes.
I like to look nice.
Is there a crime against that?
Not in this state.
-What's he doing?
-He's just changing his clothes, okay?
"Let's take a charter service.
What could go wrong?"
The rules don't apply to you.
-Do you really think that this is the time?
-It's never the time with you.
Whenever I want to talk, something is in the way.
"I have to work.
I'm busy. " You know what?
I have a life, too.
You through?
Listen, I don't know why we can't just all get along here.
You don't have to kill people and rape us, man.
Shut up.
Nothing is happening to you.
-What is it you want from us, sir?
-What I want, General... is to get out of here and head to Canada.
To do that I need a pilot.
Who knows how to fly?
You're it, little darling.
Nobody here is going to hurt you.
-Just take what you want and leave.
-That's what I'm going to do.
You'll never get away with it.
They'll hunt you down like a dog.
Oh, yeah?
I got news for you, pal.
Once they see what's in there, I'll be the least of their worries.
[Breathing abnormally fast]
JACK:
Somebody shut her up.
GARRETT:
She's hyperventilating.
[Grunting and cries amid dramatic music]
STEPHEN:
What happened?
SARAH:
Come on.
SARAH:
No, please.
You shot her.
You bastard.
You killed her.
So stupid.
Stupid and unnecessary.
You want to be next?
-Please, mister, don't hurt anybody else.
-Yeah, we'll do whatever you want.
You.
Get back there.
You fight for a living.
I fight to stay alive.
Don't make me hurt you, General.
Come on.
Don't give him an excuse to hurt anybody else.
[Eerie music plays]
What?
She's....
Oh, my God.
[Angie growls]
Some shot.
Would've gone right through the heart... if I had one.
JACK:
Don't touch it.
[Unearthly bubbling]
What just happened?
Do it.
-I said, just do it.
-What?
david:
Shouldn't we cover them up?
DEL:
No.
It's a crime scene.
DEL:
Don't touch them.
You can get in trouble.
Can I at least have a pee?
Yeah.
But use the ladies'.
And knock first.
There should be three bodies in here.
DEL:
There's no sign of the preacher anywhere.
I've checked all over.
There's no blood trails, nothing.
Do you think he could've disappeared like what's her name?
GARRETT:
How's your head?
What do you think?
My head hurts.
You suckered me.
What happened in there?
-Untie me, I'll give you the whole story.
-Right.
Lady, you got me all wrong.
All I want to do is get out of here.
I give you my word, I won't hurt anyone.
Cathy, get away from him.
-He'll say whatever you want to hear.
-I thought we were done.
We're done now.
-ls it bad in there?
-We couldn't find the preacher's body.
ANDREW:
The preacher's body?
Doesn't make any sense.
SARAH:
What did you find?
GARRETT:
Nothing.
The same.
This is so whacked, man.
Okay, people, the way I see it, we've only got two options.
We stay, or we go.
Now, I can't fly in this weather.
But if someone were willing, they might be able to hike back into town.
JACK:
How far is it?
DEL:
Seventeen miles.
Seventeen miles in this weather?
It'll never happen.
I can do it.
-Man, you're tripping.
-You'll freeze to death.
I was in Operation Frozen Shield, ma'am.
Four months of winter survival training in the Ural Mountains.
I think I can make it.
And if we stay?
Try to fix the radio.
Maybe we can get a signal out.
Maybe the phones will come back.
Sooner or later, the road will clear and we'll all be all right.
david:
How long will that be?
GARRETT:
Who knows?
But if we stay together we're all better off.
Why don't you just come out and say it?
-We stay together, we can watch each other.
-Cover each other's backs.
In case one of us is one of them.
One of what?
Lady, you crazy.
We all know what she's talking about, so why don't we just say it?
gloria:
Aliens.
david:
Oh, my God, you're all hysterical.
ANDREW:
How do you explain people vanishing in a wisp of smoke?
I don't have to believe we've been invaded by a bunch of little green men.
This is getting us nowhere.
I want to know how come she's got all the guns?
I have the guns because I'm in charge.
-ln charge of what?
Watching people die?
-No one's going to die.
Tell that to the police in there and that bitch with the nice ta-tas.
Look, let's just go.
We'll just load up the plane and fly out of here.
-Let somebody else deal with the mess.
-Amen to that.
I have got a business meeting tomorrow.
Sir, I can't leave.
The plane won't fly.
Can you understand that?
We are not taking off in this weather.
-Nobody wants to hear about your meeting.
-You got that right.
I just don't believe this.
Is this your idea of customer service?
-Just relax.
-Do not tell me to relax!
So who's she?
She's a pilot.
So she can fly.
That puts her in charge?
Exactly.
Who the hell....
[All talking at the same time]
Hey!
Let me explain it to you.
This is my airport and my charter service.
You don't like it?
Get the hell out.
I understand you people are scared and confused.
We all are.
But as long as I am here I will not tolerate this hysteria.
Is that clear?
I am the alpha female, people.
What I say goes.
Someone wants to question that... do it now.
[Jack chuckles]
Gloria, how many passengers were confirmed this morning?
I think four or five.
That means, three or four others were buying new seats.
This is beyond tweaking, you're acting like you've been hitting the pipe.
We all saw the same thing.
I didn't see aliens.
No E.T., no Mr. Spock.
I saw a woman who disappeared.
Far as I know, he probably loaded his gun with evaporating bullets or something.
SGT.
GRlFFlN:
Please.
DARlAN:
What?
What, you dissing me, man?
Don't make me slap the white off you.
There's no technology capable--
You think I don't know about technology?
I watch the Sci-Fi Channel.
I know about that Area 51 stuff.
I can try and make it into town, get some help.
I don't mind.
GARRETT:
I'd rather have you with us.
At least for now.
See what happens in the morning.
-Should we check their luggage?
-Whose?
-Whose do you think?
The aliens'.
-Stop with the alien talk, for heaven's sake.
Nobody's going through my luggage.
That's all.
SARAH:
Is that right?
DARlAN:
That's right.
DARlAN:
Who's going to try it.
You?
SARAH:
It is so unnecessary.
Please, just stay out of my face.
gloria:
Can we please stop acting like children--
david:
All right, everybody freeze!
Put it down!
GARRETT:
I'm putting the gun down.
It's okay.
Whoa, buddy, what're you doing?
-Just stay back, please.
-Okay, we'll stay back.
Just stay calm.
GARRETT:
Mister....
david:
Don't "mister" me.
david:
I don't know what is going on here, but I'm leaving.
I'm not staying here.
Understand?
All right, just put the gun down, man.
Nobody wants to get shot.
You and I will get in that airplane.
You're flying me out.
-I can't.
-You will.
I can't.
Mister, please, what's your name?
I don't want to tell you my name.
David Higgins.
Mr. Higgins, please, just calm down.
david:
You could be one of those things.
You could all be!
Hey, buddy, we're as human as you are.
All right?
-Stay back, please.
-It's okay, Mr. Higgins.
All right.
I know you're scared.
Just give me the gun.
Who are you?
Just stay away from me!
-You'll get hurt here, sir.
-Please.
Give me the gun, now.
david:
Please.
You shot him.
[Slow, dramatic music plays]
He's gone.
You killed him.
SARAH:
Look, nothing's happening.
DEL:
He was a person.
He wasn't one of them.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Okay, folks, let's try this again.
You don't want to do that.
Toss it here.
Left hand.
That gun, too.
Anyone tries to buffalo me... go for a gun, go for help, I won't think twice about putting you down.
Now you listen to me, and you're going to stay alive.
You understand?
You.
I want to see you in private.
The rest of you sit tight.
How can I get out of here?
-You're free.
Go.
-You know what I'm talking about.
-I can't take off in this weather.
-The weather will change.
Even if the storm stopped... we'd still have to clear the runway and de-ice the wings.
JACK:
Okay, what else?
Promise me nobody else gets hurt.
They might not even be people.
What if they are?
I'm not leaving them behind.
They could all be aliens.
We figure out who's who.
I see.
We just take the ones that are us and leave the rest behind.
Okay.
How?
I have your word, right?
No one gets hurt.
No one dies.
I want your word.
Or you can shoot me and fly your own damn self out of here.
DEL:
Okay.
This is the lonitech Corporation's DSR 4400 Series x-ray machine.
Features a folded photo diode display with horizontal beam orientation... non-reflective shielding, colour-enhanced video display monitor... and a conveyor belt capable of a 500-pound individual load.
This is the latest in security technology.
You're not seriously suggesting we go through that like baggage?
It could be the only way of proving who's human and who's not.
Or the only way of giving us all cancer.
I'm not doing it.
Whoever passes gets on that plane.
Whoever doesn't, doesn't.
My wife and I will go first.
-Don't volunteer me.
-I'm negotiating.
We'll go first but when we get to the other side, I want two first class seats.
It's a charter plane.
All the seats are the same.
Some must be better than others.
SARAH:
I'm not getting inside that machine.
ANDREW:
Yes, you are.
Great.
Now he knows my name.
The killer knows my name.
What will he do, send you a Christmas card?
JACK:
Cut the chatter.
DEL:
Would it help if I go first?
Ain't no way that thing will hold you, chubby.
DEL:
Hey.
It's the 4400.
It's upgraded for maximum security.
Can hold a 500-pound load of freight or baggage.
You better take off your shoes, then.
We have no way of knowing if this will work.
There's no guarantee it'll tell any difference... between any of us or any of them.
gloria:
He's got a point.
GARRETT:
Let's just try it.
DEL:
We send pets through all the time.
[Machine whirs]
See?
Not a problem.
[Machine beeps and alarms go off]
Oh, my God, he's one of those things!
ANDREW:
Kill it.
DEL:
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
ANDREW:
What're you waiting for?
It's just my....
It's just my extra magazine.
Sorry about that.
Can I get my gun back now?
GARRETT:
You be good to your word, we'll be good to ours.
JACK:
All right, who's next?
We are.
Ladies first.
[Clanking of jewellery]
-I'll be right behind you.
-Shut up.
GARRETT:
Okay, you're next, Gloria.
Please....
This really isn't necessary, is it?
Cathy, I can't.
I'm afraid, I'm terrified.
I'm claustrophobic.
GARRETT:
I'd vouch for you, Gloria, but the others will probably feel safer if we all go.
Don't worry, it won't hurt you.
You're next, killer.
Me?
What about her?
What about you?
Because I say so.
I'll shoot anyone who doesn't do what I say.
Man has a point.
Listen to the man.
What the hell?
[Machine beeps loudly]
That doesn't look right.
[Alarm goes off]
[Banging and clanking]
ANDREW:
What is that?
david:
Be careful.
You don't know what's in there.
[Muted shouts coming from machine]
DEL:
Gloria?
JACK:
Back away.
[Loud banging and screaming coming from machine]
[Series of loud explosions]
Hello.
This is Allen Air 01.
Come back.
[Radio emits static]
david:
Anyone, this is Allen Air 01.
Anybody.
Give it a rest.
You've been at that for half an hour.
This is an airport.
The radios have to work in all weather.
I'm sure you have a point.
I sell electronics equipment and something about this just isn't right.
Something's not right about a lot of things, Armani.
Seems like it should work, but the signal's scrambled.
Alien jamming, babe.
SARAH:
So what do they want?
ANDREW:
I don't know.
Whatever it is, they're willing to kill for it.
SARAH:
And what are we supposed to do?
david:
Disappoint them.
-Who was the last person that used this?
-Gloria.
The old broad?
I trusted her.
-I thought I knew her.
-You never really know anybody.
There must be a way to get a message out and let people know we've been invaded.
Boo.
How's the weather out there, boss?
It's snowing.
Soldier?
We put him in the bathroom with the others.
I'll need some more clothes.
Pack me a bag.
It's cold in Canada this time of year.
-I don't know your sizes.
-Work it out.
You, help her.
Yo, Cap.
Got to get something to eat.
DARlAN:
What's up with the grub?
Kitchen's closed.
Try the vending machines in back.
-Cool with you, boss?
-Yeah.
Yo, Armani, let's eat.
-You're letting everyone out of your sight.
-Yes, I am.
Any one of them could be one of those things.
Makes no difference to me.
You're my pilot.
That's all I care about.
-Where are the kids?
-Damn!
You stay.
I'll find them.
What're you afraid of?
I can't go anywhere.
One way or another, Jack, you're gonna have to trust me.
All right, go, but bring them back quick.
And be careful.
[Shrill wind blows]
Anybody in here?
[Slow, suspenseful music plays]
[Clanking]
GARRETT:
Kids, is that you?
[Eerie whisper-like sounds]
GARRETT:
Kids, what're you guys doing in here?
-Nothing.
-Nothing?
What's that behind you?
HANNAH:
Radio.
STEPHEN:
We were just playing.
Is this working?
Did you hear anything?
Any voices?
No, just....
[Hannah makes static-like shushing sound]
Want to play a game?
kids:
Sure.
GARRETT:
It requires you to be extra alert.
I'm going to try to call someone on the radio.
I want you both to stand over here, okay?
If you see or hear anybody, I want you to tell me right away.
-Okay?
-Okay.
Let's start.
CQ 1, this is Allen Municipal Airport.
Come in, please.
[Radio emits static]
CQ 1, this is Allen Airport.
We have an emergency.
Please come in.
GARRETT:
If anyone hears me, we've an emergency crisis... that requires law enforcement personnel.
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
Armani, come check this out.
What's your preference, man?
-Nothing for me.
-You aren't eating?
My diet doesn't allow for high fats or processed sugars.
Say what?
High glucose levels stimulate a hyper-insulin imbalance in my body... which could result in diabetic reactions or altered mood swings.
Meaning you can gun down more than one person a day.
I'll have a candy bar.
I'm going to get some more.
All out.
Got any change?
No.
Yeah, baby!
Always wanted to do that.
That's what I'm talking about.
So, what does a well-dressed convict wear on the run?
The important thing to remember is to travel light.
You don't want too much weight.
ANDREW:
Yeah, so we start with socks and underwear.
SARAH:
That's a good idea.
So.
We got you two pairs of shoes, socks, three shirts, and a pair of pants.
-Winter gear?
-You could just wear the parka you came in.
No, it's state issue.
Take my credit cards, buy whatever you need there.
Just give him the keys to our house.
No offence, but I'd like to see him leave.
-Which bags are yours?
-These.
Why do you want to see them?
I'm curious, and you have excellent taste in clothes.
He thinks we might be like the others.
Aliens.
But we went through that machine.
Andrew, I don't want him going through our bags.
Tell him.
Sarah, he's not deaf.
Are those the kids' bags?
-That's probably a good assumption.
-What's in them?
-I don't know.
-Don't you pack their clothes?
I would if I had kids.
Wait a minute.
You mean that....
Those aren't our kids.
[Ominous music plays]
Follow me.
Don't let anyone in unless you hear from me.
david:
What's up?
ANDREW:
Something about the kids.
[Suspenseful music plays]
CQ 1, this is Allen Municipal Airport.
Come in, please, we have an emergency.
CQ 1, this is Allen Municipal Airport, come in.
We have a situation that requires immediate law enforcement personnel.
GARRETT:
CQ 1, this is Allen Municipal Airport.
Come in, please.
CQ 1, this is Allen Airport, we have an emergency.
Come in.
Jack.
Garrett.
-Everything all right?
-Fine.
Found the kids.
So I see.
Can I speak to you in private?
No, don't leave me.
GARRETT:
It'll be just for a second.
STEPHEN:
No.
I'm afraid of the bad man.
You want to use the radio, too?
We have a crisis that requires law enforcement personnel.
It's not working.
-Step away from the kids.
-What?
Just do what I say.
No, he wants to hurt us.
He's a bad man.
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.
He's a very bad man.
You stop moving.
I'm not afraid of you.
Jack, what is going on?
The kids, Garrett.
They're not kids.
No.
Let go of her, you.
Trust me on this.
I said, let go!
[Voice lowering unnaturally] Now where would be the fun in that?
[Eerie instrumental music plays]
[Garrett yells out in pain]
We're going to go now, quietly and very quickly.
[Alien monster roars]
[Tense, suspenseful music plays]
Kids these days.
I'm full.
Me, too.
Why are we here, Andrew?
ANDREW:
I believe we're hiding.
No, I mean this vacation.
Why now?
You've never taken off work before.
Isn't that reason enough?
Are you having an affair with that woman?
No.
I thought that she was a loudmouthed pain in the ass.
Only reason I talked to her was to make you jealous.
Why?
Because when you and I argue....
Yeah?
When we argue it's just about the only time that you and I feel real.
I don't want to live like that.
Me either.
I think we're going to be just fine.
Is that your professional opinion?
We're safe.
If we can hold out till morning, somebody's bound to come looking for us.
What then?
Tell them aliens took over the damn airport?
They'll lock us up and throw away the key.
You can't argue with the evidence.
Let's just get out of here, Andrew.
Maybe that soldier was right, we can make it out on foot.
I know we don't have any... survival training but... we skied Aspen.
We did cross-country in Saint Moritz.
-You won't last 15 minutes out there.
-Shut up.
Shut up.
You killed that soldier, the one person that might be able to help us.
-That was an accident.
-I seen him.
-Please.
-It's true.
I didn't want to hurt that boy.
Cut the man some slack.
It was an accident.
That might help you sleep at night but it isn't a defence.
You're saying that I could be prosecuted?
No one could blame me in such a situation.
There were extenuating circumstances.
The gun just went off.
I didn't mean to pull the trigger.
[Sarah shushes the others as she hears the children laughing]
[Knocking on door]
Who is it?
HANNAH:
It's just us.
STEPHEN:
Can we come in?
[Children laugh]
STEPHEN:
Quit it.
Honey, we're not supposed to let anybody in.
HANNAH:
Why not?
STEPHEN:
We'll be good.
HANNAH:
Yeah.
We promise.
Whose kids are they?
They're not mine.
They're not yours.
What the hell?
STEPHEN:
Please?
No.
We don't know who they are.
And what are they doing here without parents?
Listen to us.
They're children, for God's sake.
No.
No, I don't think they are.
At least, I don't know.
Kids.
STEPHEN:
You'll be sorry.
[ln low alien's voice] You'll be very sorry.
Let's put something in front of the door, shall we?
JACK:
That should buy us some time.
GARRETT:
It'll have to.
I owe you a thank you for saving my ass back there.
See, Jack, you do care for people.
I need a pilot.
The only thing I care about is getting me the hell out of here.
-What is this place?
-Engineering hangar.
GARRETT:
There's a mechanic who flies in when a plane needs servicing.
-What's under there?
-I'm guessing a plane.
-Don't get cute.
Will it fly?
-I don't know.
JACK:
It's got skis, right?
That won't help without an engine that runs.
This thing's old.
So we don't have to plough any runway or de-ice the wings.
-How far is Canada?
-ln this?
Two hours.
Maybe less.
Let's get it started.
I just got my way out of this mess.
As far as I can tell, he's finished replacing the pistons.
-The casings are locked down.
-Will it fly?
First we got to get it started.
We'll need fuel.
Hand me the booster on that dolly.
I'm on it.
I'm still worried about those kids.
ANDREW:
Are they gone?
I thought I heard something before.
It's nothing.
Why would anybody leave two kids alone in an airport?
SARAH:
What're you doing?
Trying to find something to arm ourselves with.
I can't even find any steak knives.
What about this?
What the hell's that?
What are people in an airport using a thing like this for?
Avalanches.
Avalanches?
To clear avalanches.
-You've seen one of these before?
-No.
Then how do you know it's for avalanches?
Says it on the box.
What kind of bullets are these?
ANDREW:
Uses sound.
Yeah, right.
How we going to smoke aliens with sound?
Compression blast in a room this size, carries the force of a stick of dynamite.
Don't be setting off dynamite in here.
We have to do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves.
What was it?
Your crime?
What's it matter?
Doesn't, really.
Let's try this.
Give it a pull.
Come on.
There we are.
Check the linkage, we'll be good to go.
I could do some damage with this baby.
-Want coffee?
-No, thanks.
[Kicks machine]
Can I change my mind?
Sure.
Thank you.
[Jangling coin return slot]
He treat you like that at home, baby?
I'd treat you like fine wine.
You heard?
[Alien roars and Andrew screams]
Get the thing!
-What thing?
-The avalanche gun thing.
This thing must have some instructions.
Help me, man!
[Horrifically tense music plays]
david: "Pull handle to open." DARlAN:
Got it.
[Screaming] Hurry!
Go, man, go!
"Now load shell into breech, making sure case rim is fully seated."
SARAH:
Hurry!
DARlAN:
Hurry!
"Close breech fully until it locks."
Get her out of here.
Got to kill this thing!
What was that?
He doesn't have a pulse.
I think maybe he's dead.
My husband.
GARRETT:
We have to go back.
JACK:
No.
I won't leave them.
You open that door, we're as good as dead.
All right.
Stop messing with the door!
We have to go to the pilots' briefing room, right?
-Right.
-ls there any crawl space or basement?
No, only the main hall.
Wait a minute.
GARRETT:
This way.
Follow me through here.
[Tense, suspenseful music plays]
[Whispering] This way.
-Are you hurt?
-Give me a break.
david:
Can you give me a hand with this?
SARAH:
Okay.
SARAH:
There's another one of those things, right?
-There were two of them.
I'm sure of it.
-I saw it, too.
Now what?
What do you mean, now what?
Why are you asking me?
-I don't know.
-I don't know either.
-Okay!
-Okay!
We have to have a plan.
I'm sorry for being such a bitch before.
I shouldn't do that.
Tell me, is Saint Moritz really as pretty as they say it is?
Prettier.
I'll have to go there.
Maybe next Christmas.
I have some numbers.
[Loud banging]
-You know how to scream?
-Of course.
-Then scream!
-That's your plan, scream?
david:
You got a better idea?
david AND SARAH:
Help!
Help!
SARAH:
It's not working!
david:
It has to.
SARAH:
We can't let it inside.
david:
Keep pushing.
SARAH:
Okay.
david:
Help!
[David and Sarah continue yelling for help]
JACK:
Give me your hand.
Go, now!
I've got it.
-Where are the others?
-Andrew's dead.
-You're next.
-I can't.
If I let go--
JACK:
Come on, now!
[Fast-paced suspenseful music plays]
[Aliens heard growling in the distance]
-Where's Darian?
-We have to keep moving.
-What happened to Darian?
-He's dead.
JACK:
Are you sure?
david:
As far as I can tell.
That's everybody.
We're done.
GARRETT:
Come on.
Hold it.
[Aliens continue growling]
Is it gone?
For now.
[Alien monster roars and people shout]
[David screams out]
He's dead.
We have to keep moving.
[Alien monster roars in distance]
Oh, no.
You sure you want to do this?
You take care of the fireworks.
I'll do my part.
JACK:
Tough broad.
JACK:
What about you?
SARAH:
I'm fine.
One more time.
There's three of us and only one of them.
-Sarah, you're our eyes and ears.
-I can do it.
-Any luck, we'll have him here in no time.
-What's his name?
-Darian.
-Darian, right.
GARRETT:
Ready?
SARAH:
Yeah.
Ladies, we do this right, one hour from now we are headed to Canada.
-And I'm buying.
-Screw Canada.
It's too cold.
JACK:
Mexico, then.
GARRETT:
Mexico.
SARAH:
Yeah, Mexico.
Okay.
Main terminal is clear.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Okay, room's clear.
Keep going.
SARAH:
Garrett, be careful.
I don't have a view of inside the restroom.
GARRETT:
I'm going to take a look.
SARAH:
Okay.
JACK:
What's up, ladies?
See anything?
GARRETT:
Nothing yet.
You?
JACK:
So far so good.
JACK:
Bathroom?
GARRETT:
Looks clear.
It hasn't been here.
GARRETT:
Sarah, can you see me?
SARAH:
I can see you fine.
Room looks clear.
Keep going.
Copy that.
I think it's here.
JACK:
Very perceptive.
Right on top of it, Garrett.
Shut up, Jack.
[Suspenseful, dramatic music plays]
SARAH:
Garrett, I'm seeing something moving.
Okay, it's just a shadow, but....
I'm confused.
What camera's this?
Don't go back.
I see it.
SARAH:
Okay, it's on the move.
Garrett?
I'm losing you a little.
Can you....
Where are you?
GARRETT:
Baggage room.
[Whispering] Darian's at the far end of this hall.
Wait.
-I've lost it.
-What do you mean you lost it?
Oh, God, it went around a corner.
Just hold on, just stay put.
DARlAN:
What's up?
JACK:
Quiet.
We got to get out of here, now.
-I thought you left me.
-Yeah.
I tried.
-You're funny for a white guy.
-We got work to do.
I got him.
He's okay.
Repeat, I got him.
We're on our way.
Okay, good.
I....
Garrett, can you still hear me?
I can hear you fine.
Garrett, you've got to move.
SARAH:
Garrett, it's coming for you.
GARRETT:
From where?
Which way?
[Alien monster roars]
[Alien monster continues roaring softly]
[Alien roars loudly]
[Alarm goes off]
Garrett, run!
SARAH:
Run, Garrett!
Go!
Run!
[Fast-paced tense music plays]
[Alien monster roars]
SARAH:
Come on!
Come on!
Oops.
SARAH:
Looks like we made it.
GARRETT:
Yes, we did.
We was going to fly in that?
DARlAN:
How's that duct-tape special fly?
JACK:
Elbow grease and a lot of luck.
I hear that, but how we all going to fit in that?
You two are on your own.
What?
You're free to go.
Once Garrett drops me over the border, she's free, too.
You kept your word, I'll keep mine.
You know, for a killer convict escapee, you're all right.
I mean that in a good way.
Thanks a lot.
For everything.
[Phone rings]
[Phone continues ringing]
If you're ready.
DARlAN [ln woman's voice]:
Hello?
Yes!
Thank God, yes.
I've been trying to get through to you for hours.
-No.
-He's killed everyone.
And now he's after me.
That's him.
Yes, that's him.
He's coming.
Help me.
Hurry!
Surprise, surprise.
It was you all along.
I should've known by that lame rap of yours.
I be working on it...bro.
What a resilient species you are.
Even now when all is clearly lost... your instincts for survival still burn on.
I like that.
We haven't done anything to you.
What do you want?
We mean to rule.
-Rule us?
-Slave labour.
It's what we do.
Travel from planet to planet... searching for inferior beings to master and collect.
And we found ourselves a cash crop.
Hate to say it, but so far tonight you ain't shown me squat.
The body count's five to five and the sun isn't even up yet.
The ones you destroyed were soldiers, dispensable.
I'm a leader.
You mistakenly stumbled into one of our little training missions.
But soon... very soon, we'll be ready for Phase Two:
DARlAN:
Collection.
GARRETT:
We'll fight you.
We'll fight you with everything we have.
We'll never be anyone's slave.
See?
You humans have spirit.
The will to survive.
Those with spirit have a much longer shelf life.
SARAH:
What is that?
Much more effective than simple handcuffs.
Watch.
Put it on.
I won't ask again.
[Eerie music plays]
Sarah.
What happened here?
He killed my husband.
That son of a bitch.
Jack.
He killed them all.
DARlAN:
Nice witness.
DARlAN:
I'll take that.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.
It was like being outside of my body.
Your turn.
No.
-Put it on.
-I won't.
Then I'll kill him.
Hours ago, you'd have done anything to see him dead.
And now.
-Stop it.
-Why do you care for him?
Tell me why.
Because he's another human being.
We trust each other.
We care about each other.
You actually think this murderer cares for anyone besides himself?
You're free to go.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
Your freedom?
Leave her now and you'll have a chance.
Stay here and you'll all die together.
I'm sorry, Garrett.
Probably hate myself for this in the morning, but...
I told you how it was.
Human nature.
It's a bitch.
[Darian laughs]
Garrett, is that the gun I gave you?
I think it is.
Why?
JACK:
It's important.
When you went looking for the kids, is that the gun?
Yeah.
What do you care?
Just leave, Jack.
She's no longer your concern.
Don't make me retract my offer to let you live.
JACK:
Sorry, bub.
But you don't know jack.
JACK:
That hog leg ain't loaded.
GARRETT:
What?
You gave me a gun with no bullets?
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Get out of here.
I misjudged you, Jack.
You are as stupid as the rest.
Come on, convict, you can do better than that.
Not bad, but not good enough.
SARAH:
You bastard!
I'll kill you!
This is foolish, Jack.
Why you doing this?
Because we don't like you.
[Darian screaming]
Ow.
It's all right.
Sissy.
Here.
Andrew was a bit smaller than you, but they should still fit.
Anyway...
I assume you're not much for goodbyes, so....
Okay.
Hey, Garrett... thanks.
GARRETT:
For what?
Giving me a chance.
[Police sirens in distance]
They're playing my song.
I got to go.
I still owe you a ride.
A deal's a deal.
Come on.
JACK:
So, do you have any plans tonight?
GARRETT:
No, I'm kind of winging it.
JACK:
How about dinner?
GARRETT:
Drinks on you, right?
JACK:
Not a problem.
JACK:
Took Fancy Boy's pants and it's stuffed with cash.
GARRETT:
Jack.
[Dramatic instrumental music]

DOC 3123, come back.
This is DOC 3123.
We have your weather update.
Chance of flurries at higher elevations.
Supposed to clear by midnight.
Over.
We're in some weather here near Bellevue Pass.
We'll be running late.
Over.
Affirmative, 3123.
Will advise.
Why didn't we stay at Mt.
Butte instead of trying to drive through this?
- Chance of flurries, my ass.
- It's not like we planned it this way.
Besides, we got orders.
Orders is orders.
Trouble is, I think this mess is turning into a blizzard.
- Yeah, meets all the criteria.
- Criteria?
Yeah.
To be a blizzard, certain very specific criteria have to be met.
- Like what, lots of snow?
- Yeah.
Plus you got to have winds of over 45 miles per hour... temperature below 10 degrees, and visibility has to be below 500 feet.
- How do you know this?
- Weather Channel.
I still don't see why getting some dirt bag to Death Row Randolph's so important.
It's not important.
It's only orders.
You want some?
No, thank you, sir.
Told you before to call me Red.
You know, maybe I will take a cup.
Pal!
Look out!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Sorry, I think I hit-
- As long as no one's hurt.
You okay back there?
Yeah, just great.
Attention, State Police, this is State Vehicle 3123...
Department of Corrections.
Come in.
Over.
This is State Vehicle 3123.
Come in.
Over.
Attention, State Police.
Do you read me?
Over.
Come on, come on.
I repeat, do you read me?
Over.
Nothing.
- It's weird.
- So what're we going to do?
We can't stay here, not in this weather.
All right, convict, we're going on a little nature hike.
I get any funny business, I'm going to put one through your skull.
Tommy, please.
Things are hard enough, don't you think?
Got you.
Did not.
Did not.
Did not.
Did, too.
Did, too.
Hey, Garrett.
Busy night.
Where'd they all come from?
Got me.
Hey, Garrett.
Coffee?
Please.
- Del, did you plough the strip?
- Twice.
Once this morning and again at around 4:00.
I even put salt down the second time.
It's still looking pretty crazy out there.
It's really coming down.
Will you be able to take off in this weather?
- Excuse me.
You the pilot?
- I am.
What can I do for you?
Get us out of here.
We're booked on the 10:15 out of O'Hare... but my wife decided to slip in a few extra runs, we missed the bus.
It's always my fault.
I'm not assigning blame.
And it had nothing to do with you drinking all afternoon with that woman.
I told you that she was a rep from Midwestern and nothing was going on.
Nothing like last time?
Sir, ma'am, excuse me.
We've filed a flight plan.
Scheduled departure is still set for 45 minutes.
But whether we take off or not depends on the storm.
So we might be grounded?
We might not leave at all?
Yes, sir, there is a chance.
That's unacceptable.
I have a business meeting in Seattle tomorrow.
Excuse me.
Do you know who I am?
I'm David Higgins, in the Fortune 500.
It's really not up to me, sir.
It's not up to you?
You're the pilot, right?
- Yes, but the FAA-
- Then you make the final decision.
Tell her.
I'm trying to tell her.
If it's a question of money-
The FAA has strict guidelines... designed to protect the health and safety of all passengers and crew.
They decide when we are able to take off and when we can't.
Kids.
- Got you.
- Did not.
- Did, too.
- Did not, did not.
Kids!
Can't you see we're trying to have an adult conversation here?
Andrew.
We're on an indefinite hold because of the weather.
We don't know when we'll be able to take off.
Is that clear?
Ma'am?
Yes?
If you'd point me in the direction of the men's room I'd be obliged.
It's through those doors.
Bless you.
Will you take a look at this?
Sorry to bother you, ladies, but we have a situation.
We were in the process of transporting this prisoner up north... when our vehicle was disabled down the road.
We're going to need a place to hole up until our relief unit arrives.
Here?
Him?
Afraid so.
I'm not sure we have any facility to handle prisoners, Officer.
What exactly did he do?
He's a murderer, ma'am.
I'm not sure we should have a murderer here with the passengers.
We can handle him, ma'am.
It's what we do.
I'm afraid we have no choice in the matter.
If I could just make a call?
The phone lines have been down for an hour now.
- Do you have a CB, or a backup radio?
- Nothing's working.
This is ridiculous.
Just point us at a back room, we'll get out of your hair, and you get back to work.
- Del.
- Yeah, I can show them something.
I got to take a leak.
- Much obliged.
- Yeah, we're right back here, gentlemen.
Try something, you won't have to wait for the chair.
I'll fry your ass right here.
You going to watch or hold?
Check it out.
Hello, Padre.
It's Reverend, Officer.
I'm a simple preacher.
I didn't know who that was back there.
The men's room is very much like a house of God in that, in its confines... all men are welcome.
That's a good one, Reverend.
And who is this?
Prisoner.
In the process of transfer, we hit some ice, skidded off the road.
- A felon?
- He don't play well with others, sir.
I will say a prayer for his soul.
Show some respect.
All can be forgiven, if one acknowledges his wicked deeds.
Afraid my list of wicked deeds is too long.
- Shall I hear your confession?
- Say what?
That won't be necessary, Reverend.
Saving souls is always necessary.
Would you like to confess, my son?
- You're not a priest.
- No, sir.
I'm a humble preacher.
Only priests hear confession.
Who are you?
Now, son.
Perhaps you should show us some ID, Reverend.
Certainly, Officer.
My mistake.
Where I come from, convict, hitting a holy man is a grave offence.
Yeah?
Where is that?
Some place far, far away.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Taking over.
- Why?
- Because we don't like you.
- Were those gunshots?
- Of course they were.
What do you think?
You, what're you waiting for?
Get in there!
Do something.
That crazy-ass con gets out here, he's going to smoke us all.
Drop it!
I said, drop it!
Don't.
No!
Please, don't hurt him.
He's just doing his job.
- Are we done?
- Yeah.
- Hey!
- Don't shoot me!
I'm not a hero.
I'm not a hero.
Get back down there.
Everybody else, back to the seats.
You, too.
- Can we talk?
- No.
You cheated!
No, you got in front of me.
No!
You got a head start.
Hey!
You, get those kids.
We were just playing.
It's okay, honey, I think he's just tired or something.
- Tell me something.
- What?
What's your name?
- Darian.
- Darian.
- What kind of name is that?
- It's my name.
- What, you don't like my name, now?
- Tell me something, Darian... who got off the call to the cops?
- Nobody.
- Who called them?
- I ain't seen nobody call nobody, man.
- Are you lying to me?
I'm lying, I'm dying.
I know the drill, dog.
We tried.
The landlines are out.
Try yourself.
Yeah, listen to the lady, man.
Go on, try them.
Cell phones don't work here, either.
You killed those men, didn't you?
You don't have to worry about who I killed last, only who I'll kill next.
Give me your cell phone.
The bathroom, sir.
What's that?
If those men are still alive, it'll go a long way in your favour if we tried to help them.
Nobody who walked in there is ever coming out.
Son of a bitch.
You animal.
You.
Me?
Yeah.
What size shoes you wear?
Eleven.
Take them off.
Pardon?
- Sir, where's your luggage?
- It's right there.
There.
You want clothes?
There, you got clothes.
You a fancy boy?
Lots of pretty clothes.
I like to look nice.
Is there a crime against that?
Not in this state.
- What's he doing?
- He's just changing his clothes, okay?
"Let's take a charter service.
What could go wrong?"
The rules don't apply to you.
- Do you really think that this is the time?
- It's never the time with you.
Whenever I want to talk, something is in the way.
"I have to work.
I'm busy. " You know what?
I have a life, too.
You through?
Listen, I don't know why we can't just all get along here.
You don't have to kill people and rape us, man.
Shut up.
Nothing is happening to you.
- What is it you want from us, sir?
- What I want, General... is to get out of here and head to Canada.
To do that I need a pilot.
Who knows how to fly?
You're it, little darling.
Nobody here is going to hurt you.
- Just take what you want and leave.
- That's what I'm going to do.
You'll never get away with it.
They'll hunt you down like a dog.
Oh, yeah?
I got news for you, pal.
Once they see what's in there, I'll be the least of their worries.
Somebody shut her up.
She's hyperventilating.
What happened?
Come on.
No, please.
You shot her.
You bastard.
You killed her.
So stupid.
Stupid and unnecessary.
You want to be next?
- Please, mister, don't hurt anybody else.
- Yeah, we'll do whatever you want.
You.
Get back there.
You fight for a living.
I fight to stay alive.
Don't make me hurt you, General.
Come on.
Don't give him an excuse to hurt anybody else.
What?
She's...
Oh, my God.
Some shot.
Would've gone right through the heart... if I had one.
Don't touch it.
What just happened?
Do it.
- I said, just do it.
- What?
Shouldn't we cover them up?
No.
It's a crime scene.
Don't touch them.
You can get in trouble.
Can I at least have a pee?
Yeah.
But use the ladies'.
And knock first.
There should be three bodies in here.
There's no sign of the preacher anywhere.
I've checked all over.
There's no blood trails, nothing.
Do you think he could've disappeared like what's her name?
How's your head?
What do you think?
My head hurts.
You suckered me.
What happened in there?
- Untie me, I'll give you the whole story.
- Right.
Lady, you got me all wrong.
All I want to do is get out of here.
I give you my word, I won't hurt anyone.
Cathy, get away from him.
- He'll say whatever you want to hear.
- I thought we were done.
We're done now.
- Is it bad in there?
- We couldn't find the preacher's body.
The preacher's body?
Doesn't make any sense.
What did you find?
Nothing.
The same.
This is so whacked, man.
Okay, people, the way I see it, we've only got two options.
We stay, or we go.
Now, I can't fly in this weather.
But if someone were willing, they might be able to hike back into town.
How far is it?
Seventeen miles.
Seventeen miles in this weather?
It'll never happen.
I can do it.
- Man, you're tripping.
- You'll freeze to death.
I was in Operation Frozen Shield, ma'am.
Four months of winter survival training in the Ural Mountains.
I think I can make it.
And if we stay?
Try to fix the radio.
Maybe we can get a signal out.
Maybe the phones will come back.
Sooner or later, the road will clear and we'll all be all right.
How long will that be?
Who knows?
But if we stay together we're all better off.
Why don't you just come out and say it?
- We stay together, we can watch each other.
- Cover each other's backs.
In case one of us is one of them.
One of what?
Lady, you crazy.
We all know what she's talking about, so why don't we just say it?
Aliens.
Oh, my God, you're all hysterical.
How do you explain people vanishing in a wisp of smoke?
I don't have to believe we've been invaded by a bunch of little green men.
This is getting us nowhere.
I want to know how come she's got all the guns?
I have the guns because I'm in charge.
- In charge of what?
Watching people die?
- No one's going to die.
Tell that to the police in there and that bitch with the nice ta-tas.
Look, let's just go.
We'll just load up the plane and fly out of here.
- Let somebody else deal with the mess.
- Amen to that.
I have got a business meeting tomorrow.
Sir, I can't leave.
The plane won't fly.
Can you understand that?
We are not taking off in this weather.
- Nobody wants to hear about your meeting.
- You got that right.
I just don't believe this.
Is this your idea of customer service?
- Just relax.
- Do not tell me to relax!
So who's she?
She's a pilot.
So she can fly.
That puts her in charge?
Exactly.
Who the hell...
Hey!
Let me explain it to you.
This is my airport and my charter service.
You don't like it?
Get the hell out.
I understand you people are scared and confused.
We all are.
But as long as I am here I will not tolerate this hysteria.
Is that clear?
I am the alpha female, people.
What I say goes.
Someone wants to question that... do it now.
Gloria, how many passengers were confirmed this morning?
I think four or five.
That means, three or four others were buying new seats.
This is beyond tweaking, you're acting like you've been hitting the pipe.
We all saw the same thing.
I didn't see aliens.
No E.T., no Mr. Spock.
I saw a woman who disappeared.
Far as I know, he probably loaded his gun with evaporating bullets or something.
Please.
What?
What, you dissing me, man?
Don't make me slap the white off you.
There's no technology capable-
You think I don't know about technology?
I watch the Sci-Fi Channel.
I know about that Area 51 stuff.
I can try and make it into town, get some help.
I don't mind.
I'd rather have you with us.
At least for now.
See what happens in the morning.
- Should we check their luggage?
- Whose?
- Whose do you think?
The aliens'.
- Stop with the alien talk, for heaven's sake.
Nobody's going through my luggage.
That's all.
Is that right?
That's right.
Who's going to try it.
You?
It is so unnecessary.
Please, just stay out of my face.
Can we please stop acting like children-
All right, everybody freeze!
Put it down!
I'm putting the gun down.
It's okay.
Whoa, buddy, what're you doing?
- Just stay back, please.
- Okay, we'll stay back.
Just stay calm.
Mister...
Don't "mister" me.
I don't know what is going on here, but I'm leaving.
I'm not staying here.
Understand?
All right, just put the gun down, man.
Nobody wants to get shot.
You and I will get in that airplane.
You're flying me out.
- I can't.
- You will.
I can't.
Mister, please, what's your name?
I don't want to tell you my name.
David Higgins.
Mr. Higgins, please, just calm down.
You could be one of those things.
You could all be!
Hey, buddy, we're as human as you are.
All right?
- Stay back, please.
- It's okay, Mr. Higgins.
All right.
I know you're scared.
Just give me the gun.
Who are you?
Just stay away from me!
- You'll get hurt here, sir.
- Please.
Give me the gun, now.
Please.
You shot him.
He's gone.
You killed him.
Look, nothing's happening.
He was a person.
He wasn't one of them.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Okay, folks, let's try this again.
You don't want to do that.
Toss it here.
Left hand.
That gun, too.
Anyone tries to buffalo me... go for a gun, go for help, I won't think twice about putting you down.
Now you listen to me, and you're going to stay alive.
You understand?
You.
I want to see you in private.
The rest of you sit tight.
How can I get out of here?
- You're free.
Go.
- You know what I'm talking about.
- I can't take off in this weather.
- The weather will change.
Even if the storm stopped... we'd still have to clear the runway and de-ice the wings.
Okay, what else?
Promise me nobody else gets hurt.
They might not even be people.
What if they are?
I'm not leaving them behind.
They could all be aliens.
We figure out who's who.
I see.
We just take the ones that are us and leave the rest behind.
Okay.
How?
I have your word, right?
No one gets hurt.
No one dies.
I want your word.
Or you can shoot me and fly your own damn self out of here.
Okay.
This is the lonitech Corporation's DSR 4400 Series x-ray machine.
Features a folded photo diode display with horizontal beam orientation... non-reflective shielding, colour-enhanced video display monitor... and a conveyor belt capable of a 500-pound individual load.
This is the latest in security technology.
You're not seriously suggesting we go through that like baggage?
It could be the only way of proving who's human and who's not.
Or the only way of giving us all cancer.
I'm not doing it.
Whoever passes gets on that plane.
Whoever doesn't, doesn't.
My wife and I will go first.
- Don't volunteer me.
- I'm negotiating.
We'll go first but when we get to the other side, I want two first class seats.
It's a charter plane.
All the seats are the same.
Some must be better than others.
I'm not getting inside that machine.
Yes, you are.
Great.
Now he knows my name.
The killer knows my name.
What will he do, send you a Christmas card?
Cut the chatter.
Would it help if I go first?
Ain't no way that thing will hold you, chubby.
Hey.
It's the 4400.
It's upgraded for maximum security.
Can hold a 500-pound load of freight or baggage.
You better take off your shoes, then.
We have no way of knowing if this will work.
There's no guarantee it'll tell any difference... between any of us or any of them.
He's got a point.
Let's just try it.
We send pets through all the time.
See?
Not a problem.
Oh, my God, he's one of those things!
Kill it.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
What're you waiting for?
It's just my...
It's just my extra magazine.
Sorry about that.
Can I get my gun back now?
You be good to your word, we'll be good to ours.
All right, who's next?
We are.
Ladies first.
- I'll be right behind you.
- Shut up.
Okay, you're next, Gloria.
Please...
This really isn't necessary, is it?
Cathy, I can't.
I'm afraid, I'm terrified.
I'm claustrophobic.
I'd vouch for you, Gloria, but the others will probably feel safer if we all go.
Don't worry, it won't hurt you.
You're next, killer.
Me?
What about her?
What about you?
Because I say so.
I'll shoot anyone who doesn't do what I say.
Man has a point.
Listen to the man.
What the hell?
That doesn't look right.
What is that?
Be careful.
You don't know what's in there.
Gloria?
Back away.
Hello.
This is Allen Air 01.
Come back.
Anyone, this is Allen Air 01.
Anybody.
Give it a rest.
You've been at that for half an hour.
This is an airport.
The radios have to work in all weather.
I'm sure you have a point.
I sell electronics equipment and something about this just isn't right.
Something's not right about a lot of things, Armani.
Seems like it should work, but the signal's scrambled.
Alien jamming, babe.
So what do they want?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, they're willing to kill for it.
And what are we supposed to do?
Disappoint them.
- Who was the last person that used this?
- Gloria.
The old broad?
I trusted her.
- I thought I knew her.
- You never really know anybody.
There must be a way to get a message out and let people know we've been invaded.
Boo.
How's the weather out there, boss?
It's snowing.
Soldier?
We put him in the bathroom with the others.
I'll need some more clothes.
Pack me a bag.
It's cold in Canada this time of year.
- I don't know your sizes.
- Work it out.
You, help her.
Yo, Cap.
Got to get something to eat.
What's up with the grub?
Kitchen's closed.
Try the vending machines in back.
- Cool with you, boss?
- Yeah.
Yo, Armani, let's eat.
- You're letting everyone out of your sight.
- Yes, I am.
Any one of them could be one of those things.
Makes no difference to me.
You're my pilot.
That's all I care about.
- Where are the kids?
- Damn!
You stay.
I'll find them.
What're you afraid of?
I can't go anywhere.
One way or another, Jack, you're gonna have to trust me.
All right, go, but bring them back quick.
And be careful.
Anybody in here?
Kids, is that you?
Kids, what're you guys doing in here?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
What's that behind you?
Radio.
We were just playing.
Is this working?
Did you hear anything?
Any voices?
No, just...
Want to play a game?
Sure.
It requires you to be extra alert.
I'm going to try to call someone on the radio.
I want you both to stand over here, okay?
If you see or hear anybody, I want you to tell me right away.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Let's start.
CQ 1, this is Allen Municipal Airport.
Come in, please.
CQ 1, this is Allen Airport.
We have an emergency.
Please come in.
If anyone hears me, we've an emergency crisis... that requires law enforcement personnel.
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
Armani, come check this out.
What's your preference, man?
- Nothing for me.
- You aren't eating?
My diet doesn't allow for high fats or processed sugars.
Say what?
High glucose levels stimulate a hyper-insulin imbalance in my body... which could result in diabetic reactions or altered mood swings.
Meaning you can gun down more than one person a day.
I'll have a candy bar.
I'm going to get some more.
All out.
Got any change?
No.
Yeah, baby!
Always wanted to do that.
That's what I'm talking about.
So, what does a well-dressed convict wear on the run?
The important thing to remember is to travel light.
You don't want too much weight.
Yeah, so we start with socks and underwear.
That's a good idea.
So.
We got you two pairs of shoes, socks, three shirts, and a pair of pants.
- Winter gear?
- You could just wear the parka you came in.
No, it's state issue.
Take my credit cards, buy whatever you need there.
Just give him the keys to our house.
No offence, but I'd like to see him leave.
- Which bags are yours?
- These.
Why do you want to see them?
I'm curious, and you have excellent taste in clothes.
He thinks we might be like the others.
Aliens.
But we went through that machine.
Andrew, I don't want him going through our bags.
Tell him.
Sarah, he's not deaf.
Are those the kids' bags?
- That's probably a good assumption.
- What's in them?
- I don't know.
- Don't you pack their clothes?
I would if I had kids.
Wait a minute.
You mean that...
Those aren't our kids.
Follow me.
Don't let anyone in unless you hear from me.
What's up?
Something about the kids.
CQ 1, this is Allen Municipal Airport.
Come in, please, we have an emergency.
CQ 1, this is Allen Municipal Airport, come in.
We have a situation that requires immediate law enforcement personnel.
CQ 1, this is Allen Municipal Airport.
Come in, please.
CQ 1, this is Allen Airport, we have an emergency.
Come in.
Jack.
Garrett.
- Everything all right?
- Fine.
Found the kids.
So I see.
Can I speak to you in private?
No, don't leave me.
It'll be just for a second.
No.
I'm afraid of the bad man.
You want to use the radio, too?
We have a crisis that requires law enforcement personnel.
It's not working.
- Step away from the kids.
- What?
Just do what I say.
No, he wants to hurt us.
He's a bad man.
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.
He's a very bad man.
You stop moving.
I'm not afraid of you.
Jack, what is going on?
The kids, Garrett.
They're not kids.
No.
Let go of her, you.
Trust me on this.
I said, let go!
Now where would be the fun in that?
We're going to go now, quietly and very quickly.
Kids these days.
I'm full.
Me, too.
Why are we here, Andrew?
I believe we're hiding.
No, I mean this vacation.
Why now?
You've never taken off work before.
Isn't that reason enough?
Are you having an affair with that woman?
No.
I thought that she was a loudmouthed pain in the ass.
Only reason I talked to her was to make you jealous.
Why?
Because when you and I argue...
Yeah?
When we argue it's just about the only time that you and I feel real.
I don't want to live like that.
Me either.
I think we're going to be just fine.
Is that your professional opinion?
We're safe.
If we can hold out till morning, somebody's bound to come looking for us.
What then?
Tell them aliens took over the damn airport?
They'll lock us up and throw away the key.
You can't argue with the evidence.
Let's just get out of here, Andrew.
Maybe that soldier was right, we can make it out on foot.
I know we don't have any... survival training but... we skied Aspen.
We did cross-country in Saint Moritz.
- You won't last 15 minutes out there.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
You killed that soldier, the one person that might be able to help us.
- That was an accident.
- I seen him.
- Please.
- It's true.
I didn't want to hurt that boy.
Cut the man some slack.
It was an accident.
That might help you sleep at night but it isn't a defence.
You're saying that I could be prosecuted?
No one could blame me in such a situation.
There were extenuating circumstances.
The gun just went off.
I didn't mean to pull the trigger.
Who is it?
It's just us.
Can we come in?
Quit it.
Honey, we're not supposed to let anybody in.
Why not?
We'll be good.
Yeah.
We promise.
Whose kids are they?
They're not mine.
They're not yours.
What the hell?
Please?
No.
We don't know who they are.
And what are they doing here without parents?
Listen to us.
They're children, for God's sake.
No.
No, I don't think they are.
At least, I don't know.
Kids.
You'll be sorry.
You'll be very sorry.
Let's put something in front of the door, shall we?
That should buy us some time.
It'll have to.
I owe you a thank you for saving my ass back there.
See, Jack, you do care for people.
I need a pilot.
The only thing I care about is getting me the hell out of here.
- What is this place?
- Engineering hangar.
There's a mechanic who flies in when a plane needs servicing.
- What's under there?
- I'm guessing a plane.
- Don't get cute.
Will it fly?
- I don't know.
It's got skis, right?
That won't help without an engine that runs.
This thing's old.
So we don't have to plough any runway or de-ice the wings.
- How far is Canada?
- In this?
Two hours.
Maybe less.
Let's get it started.
I just got my way out of this mess.
As far as I can tell, he's finished replacing the pistons.
- The casings are locked down.
- Will it fly?
First we got to get it started.
We'll need fuel.
Hand me the booster on that dolly.
I'm on it.
I'm still worried about those kids.
Are they gone?
I thought I heard something before.
It's nothing.
Why would anybody leave two kids alone in an airport?
What're you doing?
Trying to find something to arm ourselves with.
I can't even find any steak knives.
What about this?
What the hell's that?
What are people in an airport using a thing like this for?
Avalanches.
Avalanches?
To clear avalanches.
- You've seen one of these before?
- No.
Then how do you know it's for avalanches?
Says it on the box.
What kind of bullets are these?
Uses sound.
Yeah, right.
How we going to smoke aliens with sound?
Compression blast in a room this size, carries the force of a stick of dynamite.
Don't be setting off dynamite in here.
We have to do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves.
What was it?
Your crime?
What's it matter?
Doesn't, really.
Let's try this.
Give it a pull.
Come on.
There we are.
Check the linkage, we'll be good to go.
I could do some damage with this baby.
- Want coffee?
- No, thanks.
Can I change my mind?
Sure.
Thank you.
He treat you like that at home, baby?
I'd treat you like fine wine.
You heard?
Get the thing!
- What thing?
- The avalanche gun thing.
This thing must have some instructions.
Help me, man!
"Pull handle to open. " Got it.
Hurry!
Go, man, go!
"Now load shell into breech, making sure case rim is fully seated. "
Hurry!
Hurry!
"Close breech fully until it locks. "
Get her out of here.
Got to kill this thing!
What was that?
He doesn't have a pulse.
I think maybe he's dead.
My husband.
We have to go back.
No.
I won't leave them.
You open that door, we're as good as dead.
All right.
Stop messing with the door!
We have to go to the pilots' briefing room, right?
- Right.
- Is there any crawl space or basement?
No, only the main hall.
Wait a minute.
This way.
Follow me through here.
This way.
- Are you hurt?
- Give me a break.
Can you give me a hand with this?
Okay.
There's another one of those things, right?
- There were two of them.
I'm sure of it.
- I saw it, too.
Now what?
What do you mean, now what?
Why are you asking me?
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.
- Okay!
- Okay!
We have to have a plan.
I'm sorry for being such a bitch before.
I shouldn't do that.
Tell me, is Saint Moritz really as pretty as they say it is?
Prettier.
I'll have to go there.
Maybe next Christmas.
I have some numbers.
- You know how to scream?
- Of course.
- Then scream!
- That's your plan, scream?
You got a better idea?
Help!
Help!
It's not working!
It has to.
We can't let it inside.
Keep pushing.
Okay.
Help!
Give me your hand.
Go, now!
I've got it.
- Where are the others?
- Andrew's dead.
- You're next.
- I can't.
If I let go-
Come on, now!
- Where's Darian?
- We have to keep moving.
- What happened to Darian?
- He's dead.
Are you sure?
As far as I can tell.
That's everybody.
We're done.
Come on.
Hold it.
Is it gone?
For now.
He's dead.
We have to keep moving.
Oh, no.
You sure you want to do this?
You take care of the fireworks.
I'll do my part.
Tough broad.
What about you?
I'm fine.
One more time.
There's three of us and only one of them.
- Sarah, you're our eyes and ears.
- I can do it.
- Any luck, we'll have him here in no time.
- What's his name?
- Darian.
- Darian, right.
Ready?
Yeah.
Ladies, we do this right, one hour from now we are headed to Canada.
- And I'm buying.
- Screw Canada.
It's too cold.
Mexico, then.
Mexico.
Yeah, Mexico.
Okay.
Main terminal is clear.
Okay, room's clear.
Keep going.
Garrett, be careful.
I don't have a view of inside the restroom.
I'm going to take a look.
Okay.
What's up, ladies?
See anything?
Nothing yet.
You?
So far so good.
Bathroom?
Looks clear.
It hasn't been here.
Sarah, can you see me?
I can see you fine.
Room looks clear.
Keep going.
Copy that.
I think it's here.
Very perceptive.
Right on top of it, Garrett.
Shut up, Jack.
Garrett, I'm seeing something moving.
Okay, it's just a shadow, but...
I'm confused.
What camera's this?
Don't go back.
I see it.
Okay, it's on the move.
Garrett?
I'm losing you a little.
Can you...
Where are you?
Baggage room.
Darian's at the far end of this hall.
Wait.
- I've lost it.
- What do you mean you lost it?
Oh, God, it went around a corner.
Just hold on, just stay put.
What's up?
Quiet.
We got to get out of here, now.
- I thought you left me.
- Yeah.
I tried.
- You're funny for a white guy.
- We got work to do.
I got him.
He's okay.
Repeat, I got him.
We're on our way.
Okay, good.
I...
Garrett, can you still hear me?
I can hear you fine.
Garrett, you've got to move.
Garrett, it's coming for you.
From where?
Which way?
Garrett, run!
Run, Garrett!
Go!
Run!
Come on!
Come on!
Oops.
Looks like we made it.
Yes, we did.
We was going to fly in that?
How's that duct-tape special fly?
Elbow grease and a lot of luck.
I hear that, but how we all going to fit in that?
You two are on your own.
What?
You're free to go.
Once Garrett drops me over the border, she's free, too.
You kept your word, I'll keep mine.
You know, for a killer convict escapee, you're all right.
I mean that in a good way.
Thanks a lot.
For everything.
If you're ready.
Hello?
Yes!
Thank God, yes.
I've been trying to get through to you for hours.
- No.
- He's killed everyone.
And now he's after me.
That's him.
Yes, that's him.
He's coming.
Help me.
Hurry!
Surprise, surprise.
It was you all along.
I should've known by that lame rap of yours.
I be working on it... bro.
What a resilient species you are.
Even now when all is clearly lost... your instincts for survival still burn on.
I like that.
We haven't done anything to you.
What do you want?
We mean to rule.
- Rule us?
- Slave labour.
It's what we do.
Travel from planet to planet... searching for inferior beings to master and collect.
And we found ourselves a cash crop.
Hate to say it, but so far tonight you ain't shown me squat.
The body count's five to five and the sun isn't even up yet.
The ones you destroyed were soldiers, dispensable.
I'm a leader.
You mistakenly stumbled into one of our little training missions.
But soon... very soon, we'll be ready for Phase Two:
Collection.
We'll fight you.
We'll fight you with everything we have.
We'll never be anyone's slave.
See?
You humans have spirit.
The will to survive.
Those with spirit have a much longer shelf life.
What is that?
Much more effective than simple handcuffs.
Watch.
Put it on.
I won't ask again.
Sarah.
What happened here?
He killed my husband.
That son of a bitch.
Jack.
He killed them all.
Nice witness.
I'll take that.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.
It was like being outside of my body.
Your turn.
No.
- Put it on.
- I won't.
Then I'll kill him.
Hours ago, you'd have done anything to see him dead.
And now.
- Stop it.
- Why do you care for him?
Tell me why.
Because he's another human being.
We trust each other.
We care about each other.
You actually think this murderer cares for anyone besides himself?
You're free to go.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
Your freedom?
Leave her now and you'll have a chance.
Stay here and you'll all die together.
I'm sorry, Garrett.
Probably hate myself for this in the morning, but...
I told you how it was.
Human nature.
It's a bitch.
Garrett, is that the gun I gave you?
I think it is.
Why?
It's important.
When you went looking for the kids, is that the gun?
Yeah.
What do you care?
Just leave, Jack.
She's no longer your concern.
Don't make me retract my offer to let you live.
Sorry, bub.
But you don't know jack.
That hog leg ain't loaded.
What?
You gave me a gun with no bullets?
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Get out of here.
I misjudged you, Jack.
You are as stupid as the rest.
Come on, convict, you can do better than that.
Not bad, but not good enough.
You bastard!
I'll kill you!
This is foolish, Jack.
Why you doing this?
Because we don't like you.
Ow.
It's all right.
Sissy.
Here.
Andrew was a bit smaller than you, but they should still fit.
Anyway...
I assume you're not much for goodbyes, so...
Okay.
Hey, Garrett... thanks.
For what?
Giving me a chance.
They're playing my song.
I got to go.
I still owe you a ride.
A deal's a deal.
Come on.
So, do you have any plans tonight?
No, I'm kind of winging it.
How about dinner?
Drinks on you, right?
Not a problem.
Took Fancy Boy's pants and it's stuffed with cash.
Jack.
THE KNIGHT AND THE FAKIR Part 1:
Writing is dangerous
What I liked most about Floris, was that I had something to do.
That I could do some filming.
Of course my aims were much higher.
I was thinking of Anton Wachter, the novel character by Vestdijk.
Or Multatuli, Couperus or whoever.
I was certainly not thinking about Floris.
But I thought that's available, and other things are not.
So I'll just do it.
And you say: "Let's go.
It's time we got to the castle."
Again, guys.
Action!
I thought I was a serious candidate for the job because of the navy movie that I made when I was with the Marine Corps.
In 1965, they wanted a 20 minute documentary about their Corps because of their 300th anniversary.
That was a movie that I shot...
It was only 20 minutes, but I had just seen James Bond movies.
So I shot it in a style of suspense and adventure.
The guys look really good and they're tough guys.
The National Broadcasting Corporation liked that.
They thought if he can do fight scenes with marines he might also be able to shoot adventures with two guys on a horse.
The other day I was in a department store and I saw those videos.
I'd seen them before.
I don't do anything about it.
I just notice it and I think 'not bad'.
So I say to this lady:
"That was me."
And she says to me: "Sindala!
Childhood memories!"
That was very nice.
The National Broadcasting Corporation asked me to write a series.
I thought I'd set it around 1500.
You can have all kinds of interesting things, such as gunpowder.
And you can add people from foreign countries.
So I picked a fakir because they can do strange things like lie on beds of nails or fast or climb ropes.
Quite fun.
They asked me to audition for the part of Sindala for the upcoming series Floris and the Fakir.
Originally, it was called Floris and the Fakir.
It had to have something Indian or Middle European or something.
And he embodied all that.
One of the things he asked was "Can you do an imitation of a cat?"
He's got him.
A friend of mine taught Dutch at the academy of dramatic art.
I asked him if he had a Germanic type.
He said he did but he graduated last year and he now works with the Noorder Compagnie in Friesland.
We were playing for schools there and we happened to walk into each other.
He saw what we were doing and said you might be able to get a Robin Hood type role for television.
I said that that was fun.
When I looked at his hands, I saw that he has strong, slightly crooked sausage fingers.
I thought they can hold a sword.
And when he walked away, I saw that he has short, crooked legs.
Like a cowboy.
So that was even better.
He can hold a sword and he can ride a horse.
What more can you ask for a Dutch, historical series?
I believe I auditioned with Paul.
That went alright and then Carol van Herwijnen who was also tested for the role he was who they wanted.
And then it turned out he couldn't commit for that long.
So Gerard said "Let's go back to Rutger Hauer".
At least he's the Floris type.
So that's what we did.
I was their second choice.
But I didn't care.
I was happy to do it.
And that changed my life.
Afterwards you have to say we made the best choice possible.
That's how it looks now.
You can feel when something will be good.
Nobody needs to tell you that.
I can still see Rutger arrive at the set.
You could see right away that he'll be Floris.
Do you ever write your name?
That's too hard for you.
Better study the alphabet first.
Writing is dangerous.
God exists.
Especially for script writers.
This is like a present when you're searching, with the director for locations that fit what you wrote.
We found this trapdoor and used it in the episode called The Copper Dog.
What did you find out?
-The Copper Dog's coming.
The Copper Dog?
1, 2, go!
Go, 1, 2...
-Don't you like it?
Yes, but I have to take another bite.
Swallow it.
But can you talk while you eat?
Try that.
That's much more fun.
There was no target audience, like these days.
The only audience we were thinking of was to reach as many people as possible.
Don't say "This series is for children between 4 and 9".
I wanted to make a series that children watch, but that the parents like too.
They can have the child in their lap and watch something together.
You can't make a medieval series without any jesters.
This is a fool's bauble, but a special one.
You can joke with it, but you can also steal food with it.
Chicken again?
We've had chicken for five days.
Would you prefer rabbit?
-Yes.
Don't you want anything?
He's fasting.
-What good does that do?
He's gathering mental powers.
-Mental powers?
I don't believe in them.
I believe in strong arms.
Wait and see.
They were two extremes and that was interesting.
Paul used what they contributed as people.
Jos was introverted by nature, so he was a bit hard to read.
And Rutger was all about action all day long.
In the morning, he'd be checking the horses, so to speak.
The main character is Floris, a young man who comes home after sailing under the Portuguese for years.
The fakir is Floris' friend.
He knows lots of fakir tricks.
He's a magician, an alchemist, a smart guy.
Did you feel your character had more substance than Floris?
If you have to play a not too bright character, you have to work for it.
And playing the smart guy also doesn't come automatically.
Jos was a very mysterious and introverted person.
He was hard to fathom.
We very much had our own lives.
We had a working relationship.
You only mentioned money and blood.
They must be usurers.
Are you crazy?
They're doctors.
-Doctors?
What's the difference between a doctor and a usurer?
I don't really know.
An actor can't lie to the camera, with their body or their mind.
Rutger became more prominent in the series than I'd made him on paper.
What an ending when he enters that room and he stands there leaning with the sword in his hand.
And you can see he's grown, compared to the beginning.
Talent, karma, charisma, probably.
The great charisma that Rutger's had all these years in movies.
The movies he made with me, Blade runner and others, had his charisma in them.
You couldn't avoid it, also as a director.
You had to let that happen.
And let him develop into the hero he is in Soldier of Orange, for instance.
I think to myself that I've been very lucky.
The way things worked out.
Because I wouldn't have made it without Paul.
I was way too loose-limbed.
He applied structure and strictness.
And a bit of heroism.
He taught me not to move too much and I was a young dog, really.
THE KNIGHT AND THE FAKIR Part 2:
Come, let's go!
Floris was the best time of my television career.
And the same applies to my colleagues whom I still see often.
We'd do it all over again, today, as friends.
It's a lot of fun that what you like to do, is appreciated by people.
That the streets were empty.
For half an hour, on Sunday evening.
The next day you'd see all these boys with sticks.
And with towels over their shoulders and wearing coats.
That was great fun.
It was innovative.
In those days, it was an innovative series for young people.
It was the first production with a lot of people.
The stunt team and lots of extras.
And it wasn't all that well organised.
I had to pick a camera man and I was thinking of Peter Alsemgeest but, for political reasons maybe, Ton Buné was suggested.
They said his style was more relaxed and he uses a handheld.
They probably thought it would be cheap and fast.
Max Appelboom didn't like that the production was taking too long.
He asked me to make sure Paul would hurry up a bit.
At the end, we were on a terrain like this with a big tent that housed make-up, costumes, horses...
We had to eat there and everything, because there was no more money.
It was also caused by the sound.
It's set in the Middle Ages.
But we'd hear mopeds, trains and agricultural machines in the background.
We once calculated that, over the entire production time we spent six weeks waiting,
I'm still surprised that they kept me after a couple of weeks.
Because we went much slower than everybody expected.
The budget was initially half a million guilders.
But it turned out to be 2 million.
So that's 300% over budget.
I'm hungry!
I'm hungry!
The Frisians thought that I portrayed Big Pier, their national hero a bit too... sharply.
It was a bit of a caricature of Big Pier.
Make-up took over an hour for me.
The beard was pasted on bit by bit.
I had a normal job, so I couldn't afford to grow a beard.
I had signed a contract with Max Appelboom for 17 shooting days.
That was important because I was the deputy director of a record company.
But it was so much fun and the character became interesting so it turned out to be 73 shooting days.
We did it in this paddock.
There's a ditch there.
There was more water in it than these days.
That's where we shot the famous scene with the boat that was being lifted.
You see me lift the boat on my own.
But that was a trick, of course.
There were ten men at the back to hold it.
And the camera in between and me.
Alone with the boat.
It was a very heavy boat, of course.
I was strong back then, but not strong enough to lift and throw that boat.
Improvisation has to take place within the framework that I've defined.
Countess.
Welcome, sir Floris.
-He comes in and knocks over my embroidery.
He wasn't supposed to do that.
But Paul said: "That's fun.
Let's use it."
Paul Verhoeven wants that.
He wants to see you do something.
When Paul Verhoeven knows he can trust you when he knows you can do it, he gives you free reign.
When I see someone do something during a rehearsal or during the third take something different...
I'll always go to them and say keep that, use it, don't get rid of it.
This jump and splash were performed by the stunt team that does all the dangerous work, such as jumping dragging changing horses...
with fall...
These guys were good with their bodies.
They were prepared to take certain risks.
Most of them were bouncers in Amsterdam, at night.
Back then, we had to fight and hit in the old fashion.
Bang.
Crack.
Bang.
Boom.
The strongest one won and the other one went to sleep.
Run!
I wanted to make the series as Dutch as possible with lots of fields and cows and the most typically Dutch thing.
I wanted a mill.
If you add a mill, you have to do something with it.
So I thought we'd attach the scoundrels to the sail arms, at the end.
The idea came from us, because it was set in the Middle Ages.
What can you think of to punish people?
Without chopping off any heads or hands.
They could come off the mill later, but they had still been disgraced.
I'll get you for this.
-Maybe next time.
Let's go!
For that stunt, you have to trust the people who check it.
You can't check it yourself.
A local carpenter... because you have to be able to trust him and when he says, through his chewing tobacco...
"You can hang on that.
It's alright."
And then you do it.
And when you go up, it feels very slow but when you come down, it's as if you're on your way to the Chinese.
They insisted we were insured.
And we were, but not for a stunt like this one.
That amounted to 2 million guilders.
And it could only be insured with Lloyd's.
And this man from Lloyd's came and the boys were already hanging.
...and he said: "You're insured from 1:30 to 2 PM, not a minute more".
I started fencing when I was around 14.
And horse riding too, so they were things I really liked.
It just was a lot of fun.
Playing knights.
-Yes, absolutely.
On the spur of the moment, I had to get on a horse.
So I jumped straight into the saddle.
I was very proud of that
And I had a fight scene with two swords.
I liked that too.
I found that really interesting.
So Rutger did most of his stunts himself?
That wasn't allowed.
There was a big problem with that.
The sword fighting and the long distance riding... he did that, yes.
And he dived into 2 meters of water at Doornenburg Castle.
In The Black Bullets, he dives into the moat of Doornenburg Castle.
Which was not allowed.
Diving off a high diving board was normal for me.
Also in shallow water, where you'd have to do a flat dive.
The stuntman would just jump, you know.
I thought I could make it more fun.
Rutger wanted to dive.
So I said "that's not possible".
But Rutger had made a deal with Ton Buné.
He said: "Don't tell anyone, but when we shoot the first take, I'll dive.
I said: "You're kidding." And he said: "No, I'll do it."
He said: "Make sure it's a good shot.
I'll dive."
He said: "Let the camera roll." And he did a great dive into the moat.
And I think there was about a metre of water in it.
When I said "Action" for take 1, he dived in to my big surprise.
He absolutely wanted to be the hero.
And he was right.
It looked much better than jumping.
Jumping looked dicky.
The first person jumps.
The person he's chasing, jumps.
It really looks...
like this.
If you do something better than the stuntmen, they'll admit it was good.
And then you become part of them.
We were the stunt guys.
What are we supposed to do?
Acting's his work and we do the stunts.
For me, stunts were part of the role.
It was about horse riding, sword fighting, jumping and dancing.
That was it for me.
The lines were short and a bit stiff.
Clumsy.
Let's go on.
We're going.
Let's go on.
I'd have a hard time if the lines weren't good or were too simple.
Sometimes I just couldn't say them right.
We have to go!
All those groups!
The Cinecentrum group, who provided the cameras and the sound.
And the group of Hammy de Beukelaer and the group of the actors and the group that came from nowhere, like me.
They all became one family, sitting at one table.
It was the most communist experience I've ever had.
Everybody worked with everybody and there were no classes.
The painting's finished in so far as it's finished.
But it's now in a state in which I dare show it to you.
THE KNIGHT AND THE FAKIR Part 3:
Over the top
To me, Floris was an excursion.
As a manner of speech, because it was a very professional affair, also for me.
You're an artist or you're not.
But my soul was in painting.
The part of Sindala was so complete that that mission was accomplished.
I think you could say that.
If Paul Verhoeven would call and offer me a part worth millions I could use that for an exhibition.
Then I'd make a new excursion into acting.
Get him!
In hindsight, I'm happy that it went this way.
I thought it was great to play in Floris.
It taught me things I can also use in this life.
The most noticeable building in Hernen is an old little castle that has been beautifully restored and is open to the public.
The swans of Doornenburg Castle located where the rivers Waal and Rhine split, near Nijmegen.
This is the -now empty- court from Floris.
This is the medieval side.
Gelderland has such great castles.
We went through the whole country and saw everything, but it was so clear it had to be shot there.
It was based on the fact that there was enough landscape and trees foresty areas, water.
Gelderland had most of those things.
It takes relatively long before women play a role in the series.
Why was that?
That was just a mistake.
A serious error that I made.
Luckily, two women did end up in the show.
Ada and her lady's-maid.
A tournament.
-He calls that a party.
Due to the talent of the actresses I realised later that I'd made a mistake.
I should have used those women earlier and more often.
It's a long time ago.
30 years is long.
I know that Max Appelboom was going to do that independent production and that I was supposed to meet the director.
And that Paul hired me on the spot.
He probably immediately thought I was the right type.
The best isn't good enough for you.
Feel this.
How soft.
Pure down.
Good, isn't it?
-Soft, yes.
And here... these chairs.
Try it.
Well?
-Lovely.
Can you sing us a bit?
Floris has been fighting all day so he's very tired.
And then his hand happens to fall against my hand and Ada thinks...
But he has fallen asleep.
In those days boys and girls didn't get together as freely.
Holding hands was quite something.
He's asleep.
-He's asleep?
He's asleep!
What?
-He's asleep.
Sexuality in these series...
Captain Rob, Dick Bos all those cartoon style things and Robin Hood most of all.
He has nothing in his pants.
That's not possible.
That's for a very different series.
The same applied to Floris.
It was more a first love when you're eight years old.
Very interesting, but no real itch.
I believe I only had one episode with women.
Diana Dobbelman and Ida Bons.
That was about it.
It was a men's movie.
It was an action movie.
There's not really a romantic storyline.
Surrender.
Have mercy.
Your Lordships.
I beg you.
Have mercy upon a poor robber.
What a coward.
Promise you'll never do it again.
-Never again.
We were fairly liberated for the Middle Ages.
Teaching those men a lesson in men's clothing.
Paul Verhoeven was interested in physical violence.
And that was all there was in the Middle Ages.
He loved to show that.
I always like violence.
Better be clear about it again.
I don't understand what's so despicable about violence.
I don't understand why people have such a problem with it.
The world's full of violence.
Paul was and turned out to be a great director.
He was a mathematician.
He knew exactly what he wanted.
He was not so much an actor's director.
He didn't discuss the character with you.
For him, technique was most important.
I though the series was fairly clean.
I remember I had a very big sword.
I never hit anybody with it.
After we had made three episodes, I got a call from a well-known journalist.
He asked me what I thought about the violence in the series.
I said "Which violence?
It's for children.
There is no violence."
He said he found it very violent.
I asked him if his grandma ever talked him to sleep.
About the wolf and the seven young kids.
The belly's cut open and little goats come out and all that stuff.
That's violent.
Nice and sharp.
Put him in.
It's hard to believe that that's all possible.
In those days, it was really new.
Someone might get a thumb screw put on maybe.
But it was always quickly put into perspective.
So children would think "Oh, alright".
What you also see in the Walt Disney movie.
Where you think the children won't be able to sleep.
But soon after it's solved.
And they're over it.
Open it.
What?
Is he dead?
He's just sleeping.
I was raised with grisliness.
And the greatness of imagination is much more radical in all its forms than this whining that it's too grisly for some people.
It's the only place where you can do it.
You don't have to love it.
That's another matter.
The fighting's quite sweet.
Nothing bad happens to the people.
It's all...
It's not very realistic.
It's incredibly over the top.
It's a cartoon.
Oldenstein!
-Oldenstein!
Violence is part of life.
And I thought it could also be present in this series, to a degree.
I really enjoyed tying Reinbout to the wheel.
Where is the seal?
That was the worst bit, I think.
People minded that the most.
That he was being stretched.
Where is the seal?
It's clearly exaggerated and done in an over the top way.
So it's not realistic, but it shows that they're mean.
That they're mean bastards who need to be punished badly by Floris.
There are plans for a new Floris in the Netherlands.
Would you be prepared to play the part of the old Floris?
If there's any sword fighting going on, I'll enjoy it.
I like to use a sword.
It would be great and nice to work with Rutger again.
But I don't know.
I haven't heard anything about it.
They haven't asked me yet.
If you really want to make Floris in high quality and with a new cast, of course...
maybe Rutger can play Floris' father then you'd need a lot more money.
You'd have to compare it to Fanfan la Tulipe or The Three Musketeers or something similar.
You'd have to think along those lines.
You're not talking 5 million dollars, but 50 million dollars.
It's easy to say you want to do another Blade Runner or Hitcher or Ladyhawke or Floris, because you know what it is.
But it's hard to make.
Let them do it.
Come on.
Come on!
(Man) Another bag here.
Christ.
- Sergeant?
- Yeah?
- Who are the primaries?
- Cole and Norris.
Cole's here...and Norris is at the hospital.
- What do you need?
- Room to work.
I keep ordering people off the scene, and between Narcotics, DEA and the two districts, we keep collecting more and more bodies around here.
Nobody move!
I said nobody fucking move!
If you have not been assigned a task by a Homicide detective, step away from this crime scene.
Is there anybody doesn't understand a direct order?
If you have not specifically been instructed otherwise, then remove your useless, interfering asses from the area.
Now!
Slow this thing down to a crawl.
Give these bastards no chance to fuck up in a meaningful way.
- Wedged all the way to the back.
- She couldn't get to it.
She taped it up front.
But as soon as she put any weight on these worn-ass car seats, they pulled the tape off.
Gun slid back behind the mesh as they drove, probably.
Christ.
- Where was her support?
- There were two cars several blocks distant.
She got turned around in the alleys.
She gave her 20 at the north side of Warwick.
They went there on the shots?
Foxtrot finally found her.
So, we had two units covering the north side and a helicopter up on top, and no one saw any vehicles in flight.
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, come on.
What the fuck happened?
If you walk through the garden
You better watch your back
Well, I beg your pardon
Walk the straight and narrow track
If you walk with Jesus
He'll save your soul
You gotta keep the devil
Down in the hole
All the angels sing
About Jesus' mighty sword
And they shield you with their wings
Keep you close to the Lord
Don't pay heed to temptation
For his hands are so cold
You gotta keep the devil
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
You didn't have an eyeball?
On those streets, there's no way you can eyeball it.
- She threw out 20s as best she could.
- Understood, I'm just asking.
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton, a minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.
- I gave you people all that.
- We're hitting his last-knowns.
The set-up was more than him.
The casings are different calibers and her Glock was full up.
- How bad?
- Chest wound, no exit.
Through and through to the throat.
They had the pressure pants on her to push up the pulse.
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.
OK.
You're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?
- Warwick, I think.
- OK.
You've got the east well covered.
- To the west is the rail bed.
- What did Foxtrot see?
- Nothing moving except our units.
- Lieutenant.
I know just how you feel.
This is the toughest job a police commissioner has.
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
This is Lieutenant Daniels.
Oh.
Right.
Right, of course.
This entire department stands behind Detective Greggs in every possible way.
- I just thought you should know that.
- Yes, sir.
Jaybird..
We have a runner.
Yeah, we're gonna need casts of these two imprints.
Put the lab tech on it.
The money's not anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.
I won't give a shit about the money when you have lost one of your own who might...
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.
- But if we can get to this Savino character...
- Hey.
Fuck your money.
Jimmy?
You hurt?
No.
It's hers.
Come on, get up.
Let's go.
Up with you.
Come on.
She couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.
She went into the ambo that way.
Is she...?
- What the fuck did I do?
- Come on, walk.
What's that?
- What's our plan, Ray?
- Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office typing warrants.
- Who's on the autopsy?
- Me, I'm at the morgue.
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma in case she sits up and talks.
- We're laser printing the car, right?
- Course.
Worden's on that.
- You're in command for the city, right?
- Major Rawls, Homicide.
Anything you need from my office - men, money, whatever - you just ask.
Right.
Cooperator, your girl's down shock trauma.
- Let's get to work.
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?
We got a wire up.
- So?
We got a wire up on some motherfucker that shot a cop.
If somebody says the wrong fucking thing about what happened, where the fuck do you want to be?
Church roof?
Yeah, you and me.
Sydnor takes the McCullough Street phone.
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?
Shit.
I'll do that first and meet you at the church.
Bunk, Mike.
Wonder who that bitch was.
- Always some shit, right?
- Yeah.
(Phone)
- 'Done?
'
- Done.
'All right.'
Let's get outta here.
Yeah.
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.
(Chatter on radio, indistinct)
Can I get 18-12 up here?
Whoa, whoa.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit, or even comes near it, till the tech does his recovery.
Whoa.
Hello.
- He stopped running.
- Either he got tired or...
- Or he got into a car.
- Right.
- 11-34.
- 'Go ahead, 11-34.'
I'm in the...3000 block of Landvale, backing up to the CSX bed.
I need a lab unit and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.
- 'A jackhammer?
'
- Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.
- Alive.
In the OR.
- My people at the scene have heard this.
It's a copy of the original.
- We brought a machine...
Where the fuck is...
- Sir.
Here it is.
(Rap music playing from tape)
- 'Don't fuck with this count.'
- That's Savino.
'I'll be right back with your shit.'
(Kima) 'Where are we?
That sign said Longwood but I could swear this is Warwick.'
'The hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with you all.'
'I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley, I don't know, shit... 'half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
'I hope you all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?
'
'He better not be long cos I don't know where the stash is, 'and if they dragging us all over this part of town...'
- (Kima) 'What's that?
'
- Jesus.
- 'Something ain't right.
This shit ain't right.'
- Christ.
(Gunfire)
(Kima) 'Signal 13, signal 13.'
- 'Where the fuck...?
'
- She can't reach the gun.
- 'What the fuck?
' - 'Two males, black hoodies, both armed...'
(Gunfire)
Shut it Off.
Shut it Off.
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.
You played a lot of fucking cards and made a lot of people do a lot of fucking things they didn't want to do.
This is true.
We both know this is true.
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here and say you did a single fucking thing to get a police shot.
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?
This is not on you.
No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.
And the motherfucker saying this...
he hates your guts, McNulty.
So you know if it was on you, I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.
That's the only lesson here.
Police!
Police, let me see your hands.
- Hands on your head!
- Down on the ground!
Search warrant, get on the ground.
Police.
Get down.
Let's see your hands.
- He ain't here!
- Who ain't here?
- Zach, he ain't here!
- Zach?
- No, honey, we're looking for Savino.
- Savino?
No, he's my baby.
Yeah, well, your baby shot a cop.
(Man) 'They're kicking in the doors, looking for Savino.'
- (2nd man) 'What up with that, man?
' - 'Some shit about he killed a cop.'
'Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.'
'They acting like he did it.'
- 'Shit.' - 'I'm telling you, man.'
- They're talking about it anyway.
- Ripples in the pond.
Talking ain't knowing, is it?
(Signs)
Skin this cat another way.
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?
Only this one after the shooting.
Who's 07?
And what phone is he asking for Stringer to call him back?
- Shit went good but...
- Hold on.
(Radio) 'The officer may have been undercover.'
- All right, talk.
- Like I said, it went good.
Except there was this bitch in the back seat.
Surprised the shit out of us.
Didn't even see her until the shit popped off.
I mean if it was up to me, I'd have let the girl walk.
She ain't look like the talking type.
But Little Man seen her, bugged out and let a couple go.
- Savino didn't tip y'all off?
- Wasn't no time.
He get up out the car, we see him go up the block like we said, right?
After that, he out of sight and we bring it home like we planned, baby.
Shorty was a cop.
And she ain't dead.
Where'd you all put the guns?
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's hos.
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?
- A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
- What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?
This motherfucker bugged out one time.
He gonna bug out again when he find out shorty's a fucking cop?
Come on, man.
Savino got a story that he can keep to and he know it.
But Little Man, he always been fucking weak like that.
Little Man gotta go.
You hear me?
This shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me?
We gotta fall back.
I wanna see how it go with this Savino bullshit, see how they go past that.
But if the shit don't hold or if this cop wake up and start talking shit, then you gotta go sky up.
Where you got your peoples at?
New York, Jersey, Cleveland.
All right.
So, Philly?
DC?
You know what I'm saying?
No profile, no connections, no noise.
You feel me, right?
All right.
We gotta be careful.
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.
It's all right, you just scared me.
I, er...
I work with Kima.
- Kima, she...
- Kima's at work.
What are you...?
Dust the receiver, the coin return and the metal top.
The can, too.
(Doctor) We can't really know for sure.
Lieutenant?
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and...
Maybe somebody from the department or the city might want to say something.
Who's here from the family?
A daughter, you say?
- A daughter?
- Officer Greggs has a girl?
A roommate.
The family's in Richmond, driving up first thing.
The roommate's already here.
I'll do it myself.
No problem.
If we lose her, he can always pose for the funeral.
Still need the right door for Savino.
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama.
Nothing.
Tracers picked up a of couple hairs on one of the hoodies.
So either these guys are neighborhood yos who lucked into $30,000 on a street stick-up, or...
Or they're pros who set up in an alley on one side of the tracks then slip over to the other side, where they park their ride.
What about the post?
Cause and manner of death on Mr. Blocker is homicide, to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder, chest and left arm.
Nine millimeter, six left twist, suitable for comparison.
We pulled something else from the back seat of the car?
Yeah, .380.
Semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.
So we confirmed the two shooters.
Print hit.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice, enforcer in the 221 and a definite connect to Barksdale's world.
Print hit?
Print hit from what?
Soda can.
Dropped at the pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere.
Still had fizz in it when I got there.
What is this pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere?
Some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell 20 minutes after the shooting.
I dusted the phone, too, but it was smudged.
So we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.
So much for the amateur-hour theory.
Good pull.
You are?
Freamon.
Lester Freamon.
- Where you working?
- Pawnshop Unit.
How you gonna shoot a police?
Ain't no percentage in that, know what I'm saying?
For real.
Someone around here do that, every knocko in the world be down here busting heads.
I guess them Park Heights niggers just ain't got no fucking common sense.
- A lotta heart, just no sense.
- Poot.
Wallace on the phone.
- Yeah?
- Wallace?
Nigger ring me up twice a day whether he got shit to say or not.
- Homesick motherfucker making me bug.
- Where's he at?
At the shore with his grandma.
Surfing or some bullshit.
Or something.
(Beeping)
- You just use that phone?
- Yeah, a little earlier.
- You might wanna go to Mosher Street.
- Just now?
Yeah.
- A man downtown needs to talk to you.
- Man downtown?
Make some sense for this man, please.
- I ain't never been so clean in my life.
- I'm just doing my job.
- What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?
- 'No, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.
- 'My grandmother on the bayside.'
- You on vacation and not bringing me.
- 'How you get all the way down there?
'
- I took a bus.
'Shit, tell me how to go, and I grab a 'hound, too.
'Come down and hang with your ass.'
No, man, it ain't like that.
The air down here all sticky.
Worse than Baltimore.
'And these crickets, louder than a motherfucker.
I can't get no sleep.'
I ain't cut out to be no country-ass nigger.
'Please deposit two dollars for an additional two minutes.'
Shit, I gotta go.
You can take a nigger out the Westside but you can't take... (Beeping)
What's your name?
Look, I didn't do shit here, OK?
- I asked you your name.
- No, this shit ain't right.
- Who'd you try to page, shit bird?
- Why the fuck do you care?
I mean...
You have exactly three more seconds to explain yourself to me, asshole.
One shooter opened the passenger door,
- so any latent prints from that side...
- (Muffled shouts)
- Why'd you page her, shit bird?
- Get off me.
- You think this is a game?
- I wanna talk to Greggs.
- You can't, motherfucker.
- Then McNulty then.
This shit ain't right, sir.
Savino.
Savino.
Mope ain't around.
One of them low-rise hoppers on tower phone two.
OK.
Maybe he forgot the number.
- What the fuck was that?
- You don't know?
We just caught a re-up off the tower stash.
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.
(Daniels) Put that away.
Put that away and work the case.
Can I ask you something?
How much of this case would you give up to get her back?
- That's not the point.
- How much?
All Of it.
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.
I'm sitting with a hospital progress report that shows no fucking progress.
She's not conscious, she's intubated, she's had a trach and a lung collapse.
And if she's got a shred of luck, the shot she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.
It wasn't worth it.
Homicide for McNulty on line two.
Do your job.
- Yeah?
- (Bunk) 'So how you doing with it?
'
- I'll live.
- Yeah?
Well, listen, Jimmy.
We had a little dust-up over here.
Holley might have beat one of your girl's Cls on spec.
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?
'That's him.
You might wanna roll past and squelch this shit before it gets outta hand.'
Yeah.
- It ain't worth it, man.
- It ain't worth it at ten times the price.
A fucking cop, man!
How stupid is this motherfucker?
If you see a bitch in the car, change it up.
We can go to Orlando another day.
Savino was trying to signal, but he in the dark, he don't know where Bey's coming from.
- Nothing breaking our way.
- We gotta burn this cop money.
It's probably marked somehow.
The guns are in the sewer, Bey's a rock, but it's the bitch cop.
If she talks, she gonna put Little Man and Bey in there.
- What up with Little Man?
- He's scared.
He shot a cop.
- Fuck.
- But I put Bey on that.
- What about Savino?
- Savino, he gotta eat the charge.
But he knew that.
So if he keep his story tight, he gonna be all right.
We knew Orlando was a snitching motherfucker.
But this is cash.
He got us caught up.
I know, man.
That's my fault, man.
Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that if they take Orlando, they can take the cash.
I was like, you all get your payday...
How the fuck is Orlando gonna front this type of cash?
- What it say?
- I know, I fucked up.
All right, take this trash outside, fucking burn it.
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess before he jet.
He was throwing 911 messages to her pager.
I asked him why.
He braced up.
Shit got outta hand.
- Does he know?
- Uh-uh.
McNulty, man.
What they doing over there?
He just started beating on me.
Last night, she got shot.
- Where the fuck were you at?
- (McNulty) I was there.
Hey, Bunk.
We got no good latents on the passenger side door.
What about the dash?
Call the lab.
What can I do?
For one thing you can roll around the projects, see who's missing.
Who ain't around.
You OK with that?
Yeah, I just, erm...
I been keeping it kinda close, you know?
Ain't been around the projects much lately.
You know what I'm saying?
You beefing with someone down there?
No, I'm not beefing with...
Eyes open, Bubs.
For Kima.
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.
Where are we with Savino?
- Still MIA.
- Enough of this bullshit.
Well, if he calls me, I'll tell him to turn himself in.
I'm going to do that.
- Not good enough.
- Excuse me?
We need him now.
No, thanks.
Perhaps as an officer of the court...
Ronnie is being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.
She's putting it into your twisted language.
Me?
I wouldn't wipe my ass with a Baltimore lawyer.
- No offense.
- None taken.
I'm willing to let you ratfuckers suborn perjury and blow smoke up a judge's ass and jury-tamper your balls off without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition.
Fuck me if I don't let you structure your cash into briefcase fees, either.
That's between you and the IRS.
Neither one of you is anyone's friend.
What Jimmy is trying to say is...
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want my nose closed to your shit, you have to throw me something.
Right now I need Savino Bratton in bracelets.
- I don't know where he is.
- You repped him the last four felonies.
I guess you can get word to him if you want to.
A police may die, Maury, and Savino was there.
He comes in this afternoon, and he takes the drug charge at least.
Or what?
Or we send tactical teams into his momma's house until there's no house left to worry about.
You get a letter from the State's Attorney's office, and subpoenas for all your bank accounts.
And let's see if all those cash deposits match the reported income.
I'm hearing this from him, and I understand that he's distraught.
Am I hearing this from the State's Attorney's office as well?
You are.
I'll see what I can do.
Fuck you, Jimmy!
- You didn't tell me that was coming.
- He'll bring him in.
- He will if he can, that's not the point.
- What's the point?
The point is that Maury Levy is a past officer of the Monumental Bar Association, and unless I want to spend my whole life as an ASA,
I can't spend time pissing on people who matter.
Another career in the balance.
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.
If only half of you in the State's Attorney's office didn't want to be judges, didn't want to be partners in a law firm, if you had the balls to follow through, you know what would happen?
A guy like that would be tried and convicted.
The rest of them would back up so we could push a clean case through.
But everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.
And everybody's got a fucking future.
You'll just use anyone, won't you?
I've been searching the logs for pager hits that used an 07 code, right?
It comes up now and then on D'Angelo's pager.
Stringer's, too, but less often.
Most of the time, there's nothing to place the guy.
But check it.
- And this is on Stringer's page?
- It comes back to the pay phone at Maryland General Hospital.
Let me guess.
The date of this page is the same day that Stinkum got killed.
- And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.
- That was the talk on the wire, anyway.
If you pull the ER records for that morning, you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.
07 is Wee-Bey.
It's gotta be.
Then we have Wee-Bey and Little Man at the pay phone at Park Heights 20 minutes after the ambush, throwing a page to Stringer.
We're all over town for this piece-of-shit Savino.
With ties to the Barksdale organization?
- Yes, sir.
- What else?
The case is progressing.
We're gleaning possible shooters from the wiretap.
I asked for the controlled buy.
I put one of our people in harm's way.
So right now I want to make sure that we are doing everything.
- We are, sir, we're on it.
- Good.
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.
Any addresses we can write on, anything connected to a narcotics case.
CID, tactical, the deus.
And tomorrow, on the six o'clock news, we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.
A lot of it.
Dope on the table?
We need to let them know who we are.
We can't for one minute let them think that this will stand.
The Commissioner wants to send a message, Lieutenant.
You make sure you and your people do everything possible to see that it is heard.
Dope on the damn table.
Hey, it's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?
Again, for the record, let's make clear that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized and that what is said here is for purposes of a proffer.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
OK, then.
Here you go.
That's baking soda.
Which Mr. Bratton intended to sell to Orlando Blocker.
You can keep it with our compliments.
- Where's the money?
- Mr. Bratton did not receive money.
He left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.
If you recorded the transaction, the tape will confirm this.
And he wasn't around for the shooting.
He doesn't know who the shooters are.
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck that he left them in an dead-end alley and they were shot just two minutes later.
This is bullshit.
A police is down.
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer and no intention of doing anything other than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.
Ms. Nathan?
No charge if he gives us the shooters.
And if he testifies, we'll find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program.
As I indicated, Mr. Bratton has no idea who shot Mr. Blocker or the undercover officer.
Best you can do is 286B.
- What the hell is that?
- Distribution of sham CDS.
- Three-year maximum, $5,000 fine.
- That's it?
If he took the cash, we could go to felony theft or fraud, but the tape has him leaving the money.
- Three years.
- A cop was shot, Maury.
So if we convict, he'll do every damn day of the three.
I can do the three.
Ain't no thing.
And the $5,000 fine?
Oh, shit, you still up $25,000, right?
Nicely done.
Give me two.
Damn, Orlando.
I still can't believe that shit.
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?
He ran a club for my uncle.
Yeah?
First Stink, and now him.
And I heard the cops been all in Savino's shit, too.
- He ain't been around.
- Little Man, neither.
Somebody could clean up shit around here.
True.
You can't just be going around dropping Five-0 like that.
You know how your uncle is when people get to fucking up.
He starts taking that shit personal, man.
Look like a couple more niggers gonna get dropped.
- What up?
- You D?
Yeah.
You need to get with Stringer right away.
See?
You moving up in the world.
As long as you don't fall in with the trash they taking out.
Yeah, whatever, nigger.
I'll be right back.
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.
Ain't answering his page, neither.
See?
I'm not gonna lie.
She has swelling around the vertebrae, and some indications of partial paralysis.
That may or may not go away when the swelling goes down.
- Her family is with her.
- What the fuck is up with Homicide?
- Are we on the shooters yet?
- They're working it hard.
The departmental response is gonna be to take doors tomorrow morning.
Citywide.
Every unit is kicking in any drug-connected address they can write on.
- We're gonna do the same.
- Lieutenant, is that...
Except...we're gonna hold back on the main stash.
The house up in northwest we tracked...
We advance this case more by sitting there.
And raids that are too much on the bull's-eye will have Barksdale changing up.
We might blow the wire altogether.
Two addresses in the low-rises are probables and another two row houses have been used for stash as recently as last week.
But this...
this here is the best bet for a good rip.
Herc picked up on it yesterday.
Fourth-floor, end unit on the south side of the 221.
They're dropping the re-ups out the window to the hoppers.
- What if they change up the apartment?
- They do that every day.
- Yesterday was the fifth floor, north side.
- We'll have a man there with a cell phone.
They change up, we call the duty judge, who orally amends the warrant.
We hit everything at 11:00.
The squad that takes the high-rise needs to stage at 05:00.
We need to be inside before the building even wakes up.
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight needs to start typing his ass off right now.
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?
You going with Bey.
Yo, Bey.
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.
Going where?
What the fuck you waiting for?
(Arguing, indistinct)
Stop bullshitting me!
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.
The Deputy.
We grab a senator's bag man in the projects, he knows that.
State Police come in, he knows that, too.
- Like fucking clockwork.
- He's got a rat.
Here, in the detail.
In the beginning, when we started, Burrell had me.
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.
- But now...
- He lost you.
So now he's picked up someone else.
That's how they do.
(Chatter)
Can we talk?
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.
- What now?
- We're on a prime location.
Barksdale's stash.
He wants us to write a paper and take the door.
- Why?
- Dope on the table.
It's a photo op to make us feel better about Greggs getting shot.
- Christ.
- You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.
Er...
I don't know, Jimmy.
You back on the ticket, huh?
It was just the usual bullshit.
They're just clicking me around, trying to get another black face, make it four-and-one to even up for the last time.
The Governor promised two new appointments.
So now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.
That's all?
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.
It has nothing to do with your case.
I need you on this.
So, who's my daddy now?
I just do what the fuck they tell me, you know?
It ain't on me to know what the fuck they have in mind.
- Look, Bey.
- Now it come down to this crazy shit.
Yo, turn in this alley right here.
Right there.
...what's the sound?
Out of bounds
Another nigger down and out A crackhead with no name...
What the fuck you stopping for?
Go!
...some guy hit hard and wound up paying
Out in the field where the bands keep playing
Understand what I'm saying...
Inside, man.
Let's go.
This dude is crazy.
Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.
Man, get in here.
Go ahead, man.
What's wrong with you?
Check it out, D.
I need you to feed them while I'm gone.
You gonna give them different food for each tank, too, all right?
But don't worry.
I'm gonna show you what to do.
Come here.
These are my Tetras.
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey and Jezebel in here somewhere.
I don't know, she think she cute.
You take two pinches of whatever food I got next to each tank.
They set for the day.
You see, they ain't no problems.
Just beautiful as hell, D.
I'm gonna go upstairs and pack some shit.
Yo, Bey.
Where we going, man?
Philly.
You gonna take the truck back, but first I got to grab some shit, show you what to do with my tanks, right?
Philly?
We shot a narco, D.
...I've been told
Soothe me
I want some sugar in my bowl
I want some steam on my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
What's the matter, Daddy?
Come on, save my soul
I want some sugar in my bowl
I ain't foolin'...
No Savino.
No Little Man, no Wee-Bey, either.
And the Barksdale kid from the Pit.
He's out the mix, too.
You think it was them that did it?
- (McNulty) 'Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.'
- Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers and miles of NCIC bullshit.
- 'Warrants for blood and hair, too.'
- It's Bey and Little Man, shooter one and two.
Yeah?
Well, right now we need our girl to wake up and say so.
All right.
You did good, Bubs.
McNulty, you know...
the situation is different for me.
- I mean, for me, I'm...
- Mount up.
L gotta go.
Prez will get you a ride, OK?
(Helicopter overhead)
Move out.
Police.
Police!
Go!
Show your hands, asshole!
Down on the ground.
Move it!
(All shouting)
Check the basement.
- Clear?
- All clear.
- Bathroom's clear.
- Check the mattress.
Check under the bed, check all the drawers, every inch of this room.
- Got anything?
- No.
Bingo.
- Got it.
-There she goes.
Bag it.
Let's do it.
That's fine police work, Erv.
'Ladies and gentlemen, 'what you see on the table in front of you 'represents our department's answer to a culture of death and drugs.
'And when an officer falls in this war, 'others stand ready to pick up the challenge 'and carry the fight to the very doorstep of those responsible.
'This is only the beginning, I can assure you.
'But today, a message has been sent.
'And believe me, this message is being heard loud and clear
- 'by all those who seek profit and power...' - (Phone)
'..in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.'
Slow.
Bullshit on the McCullough Street phone, nothing on the towers.
- Who's on the rooftop?
- No one.
Fuck it.
'Where's the money, man?
'
- 'How much you need?
' - 'The bus cost like $18, man.'
- 'Your grandma ain't got it?
' - 'She gonna try to stop me from booking.
'I'm telling you, boy.
This country-ass shit got me all messed up.
'You need to send me something for the bus.
I'm dying.'
'I feel you.
When do you want to come home?
'
- 'When the money get here.' - 'All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.'
(Equipment beeping, respirator pumping)
(helicopter hovering)
How many bags you got?
C'mon, c'mon!
(camera clicking)
Another bag here.
Christ.
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.
Who are the primaries?
Cole and Norris.
Cole's here and Norris is at the hospital.
What do you need?
Room to work.
I keep ordering people off the scene, and between narcotics, DEA and the two districts, we keep collecting more and more bodies around here.
Nobody move!
I said, nobody fucking move!
If you have not been assigned a specific task by a homicide detective, you need to step away from this crime scene.
Is there anybody doesn't understand a direct order?
If you have not specifically been instructed otherwise, then remove your useless interfering asses from the area.
Now!
Slow this thing down to a crawl.
Give these bastards no chance to fuck up in a meaningful way.
Okay.
Aah!
Wedged all the way to the back.
She couldn't get to it.
Well, she taped it up front, but as soon as she put any weight on these worn-ass car seats, they pulled the tape off.
Gun slid back behind the mesh as they drove, probably.
Christ.
Where was her support?
There were two follow cars, they were several blocks distant.
I think she got turned around in the alleys, she gave her 20 as the north side of Warwick.
They went there on the shots?
This, uh...
Foxtrot finally found her.
So, we had two units covering the north side and a helicopter up on top.
And no one saw any vehicles in flight.
(police radio chatter)
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, c'mon.
What the fuck happened?

You didn't have an eyeball?
On those streets, there's no way you can eyeball it.
She was throwing out 20s as best she could.
Understood, I'm just asking.
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton.
A minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.
I gave your people all that at the scene.
And we're hitting his last knowns.
We're on that.
The set-up was more than him.
Casings are different calibers, and her Glock was full up, so...
How bad?
Chest wound, no exit.
Through-and-through to the throat.
She wasn't stabilized.
They had the pressure pants on her.
Trying to push up the pulse.
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.
Right.
So, you're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?
Um, Warwick, I think.
Okay.
You've got everything to the east well-covered and to the west is the railbed.
What did Foxtrot see?
Nothing moving except our units.
Lieutenant...
I know just how you feel.
This is the toughest job a police commissioner has.
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
Um, this is Lieutenant Daniels.
Oh, right, right, of course.
This entire department stands behind Detective Greggs in every possible way.
I just thought you should know that.
Yes, sir.
P.A. system:
...please report to room 12.
Please report to room 12.
Jaybird.
We have a runner.
Yeah, we're gonna need casts of these two imprints.
Put the lab tech on.
11-39.
It's not that the money is anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.
I'm not going to be standing here giving a shit about the money when you people have lost... well, one of your own who might...
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.
On the other hand, if we can get to this Savino character quick--
Hey!
Fuck your money.
Jimmy?
You hurt?
No.
It's hers.
C'mon, get up.
Let's go, up with you.
C'mon.
Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.
She went into the ambo that way.
Is she, uh... what the fuck did I do?
C'mon, walk.
What's that?
What's our plan, Ray?
Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office typing the warrants for this Savino fuck.
Who's on the autopsy?
Me, I'm at the morgue.
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma in case she sits up and talks.
We're laser printing the car, right?
'Course, Worden's on that.
You're in command for the city, right?
Major Rawls, homicide.
Anything you need from my office, men, money, whatever, you just ask.
Right.
Cooperator, your girl's down shock trauma.
Let's get to work.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
- We got a wire up.
- So?
So we got a wire up on some motherfucker that just shot a cop.
If somebody talks, if somebody gets on the wrong phone and says the wrong fuckin' thing about what happened here tonight, where the fuck do you want to be?
!
Church roof?
Yeah, you and me.
Sydnor takes the McCulloh street phone.
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?
Shit.
I'll do that first, meet you at the church.
Bunk, Mike.
Wonder who that bitch was.
Always some shit, right?
Yeah.
(phone ringing)
- Male:
Yo.
- Done.
All right.
Let's get outta here.
Yeah.
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.
- 11-39.
- Woman on radio: 11-35.
Can I get 18-12 up here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
(chuckling)
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit, nobody even comes near it until the tech does his recovery.
Whoa.
Hello.
He stopped running.
Either he got tired or--
- Or he got into a car.
- Right.
- 11-34.
- Man on radio:
Go ahead, 11-34.
I'm in the 3,000 block of Lanvale backing up to the CSX bed.
I need a lab unit and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.
A jackhammer?
Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.
Alive.
In the OR.
My people at the scene have heard this already.
It's a copy of the original.
Okay, we brought a machine- where the fuck is--
- Sir.
Oh, here it is, here.
Yeah, put it there.
(music playing)
Savino:
Don't fuck with this count.
That's Savino.
I'll be right back with ya shit.
Greggs:
Where are we?
That sign said Longwood, but I could swear this is Warwick.
Orlando:
Hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with y'all.
Greggs:
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley, I don't know, shit, half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
I hope y'all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?
Orlando:
He better not be long 'cause, see,
I don't know where the stash is, and if they draggin' us all over this part of town, you know--
Greggs:
What's that?
Oh, Jesus.
- Somethin' ain't right.
- Orlando:
What?
- Greggs:
Shit ain't right.
- Oh, Christ.
- Man:
You snitchin' motherfucker.
- (gunshots)
Greggs:
Signal 13, signal 13.
What the fuck?
- She can't reach the gun.
- What the fuck?
Two males, black hoodies, both of 'em, one is--
(gunshots)
Shut it off.
Shut it off.
P.A. system:
Dr. Mells, line six.
Dr. Mells, line six.
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.
You played a lot of fucking cards and you made a lot of fucking people do a lot of fucking things they didn't want to do.
This is true.
We both know this is true.
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here and say you did a single fucking thing to get a police shot.
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?
This is not on you.
No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.
And the motherfucker saying this, he hates your guts, McNulty.
So you know if it was on you,
I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.
That's the only lesson here.
Police!
Police!
Police, let me see your hands!
Get on the ground!
Down on the ground!
Search warrant, get on the ground!
Police, police, get down, get down!
- He ain't here!
- Who ain't here?
- Zach, he ain't here!
- Zach?
Naw, honey, we're lookin' for Savino.
Savino?
No, he's my baby.
Yeah, well, your baby shot a cop.
Man:
Yo, they kickin' in the doors, lookin' for a Savino.
Man #2:
What?
What up with that, man?
Man:
Some shit about he killed a cop.
Man #2:
Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.
Man:
Man they kicking' in doors, they actin' like he did it.
- Shit.
- I'm tellin' you, man.
(beeping)
They're talkin' about it anyway.
Ripples in the pond.
Talkin' ain't knowing', is it?
Skin this cat another way.
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?
Only this one after the shooting.
Who's 0-7?
And what phone is he asking for Stringer to call him back?
- Shit went good, but there was--
- Hold on.
Radio:
...around 12:30 this morning.
The officer may have been undercover... (machine humming)
- All right, so talk.
- Like I said, it went good.
Except there was this bitch curled up in the back-seat.
- Surprised the shit out of us.
- Uh-huh.
Didn't even see her till the shit popped off.
I mean, and if it was up to me,
I'd let the girl walk.
She didn't look like the talkin' type.
But Little Man seen her, and bugged out, let a couple go.
Savino didn't tip y'all off to that bitch?
Wasn't no time for that.
He get up out the car, we see him go up the block like we said, right?
After that, he out of sight and we bring it home like we planned, baby.
Well, shorty was a cop.
And she ain't dead.
Where'd y'all put the guns?
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's ho's.
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?
A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?
I mean, this motherfucker bugged out one time.
Well, he gonna bug out again, when he find out shorty's a fuckin' cop?
I mean, c'mon, man.
Savino got a story that he can keep to and he know it, but Little Man, he always been fuckin' weak like that.
Little Man gotta go.
Yo, you hear me?
Yo, this shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me, Bey?
We gotta fall back.
I wanna see how it go with this Savino bullshit, see how they go past that.
But if the shit don't hold, or if this motherfuckin' cop wake up and start talkin' shit, then you gotta go sky up.
Where you got your peoples at?
New York...
Jersey, Cleveland.
All right, so, um, Philly, D.C.
You know what I'm sayin'?
No profile, no connections, no noise.
You feel me, right?
All right.
We gotta be careful.
(muffled voices)
Jesus.
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.
It's alright, you just scared me.
I, uh...
I work with Kima.
Uh...
Kima, she, uh...
Kima-- Kima's at work.
What?
W-w-what are you--
Dust the receiver, the coin return, and the metal top.
The can, too.
P.A. system:
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station, please.
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station.
We can't really know for sure.
Lieutenant?
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and,
I mean, maybe somebody from the department or the city, maybe might want to say something.
Who's here from the family?
- A daughter, you say?
- A daughter?
Officer Greggs has a girl?
A roommate.
The family's in Richmond, driving up first thing today, but the roommate's already here.
I'll do it myself.
No problem.
If we lose her, he can always pose for the funeral.
Still need a right door for Savino.
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama, all empty holes.
Tracers picked up a couple hairs on one of the hoodies.
That's something.
So, either these motherfuckers are a pair of neighborhood yo's who lucked into $30,000 on a street stickup or...
Or they're pros who set up in an alley on one side of the tracks, then slip over to the other side where they park their ride.
What about the post?
Cause and manner of death on Mr. Blocker is homicide, to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder, chest and left arm.
Nine millimeter, six left twist, suitable for comparison.
We pulled something different from the back seat of the car, right?
Yeah, 380, semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.
So, we confirmed the two shooters.
Print hit.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice, enforcer in the 221, a definite connect to Barksdale's world.
- A print hit?
- Print hit from what?
Soda can.
Dropped at the pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere.
Still had a little fizz in it when I got there.
What the fuck is this pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere?
It's a phone from which some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell 20 minutes after the shooting.
I dusted the phone, too, but it was smudged.
So, we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest, ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.
So much for the amateur-hour theory.
Good pull.
You are?
Freamon, Lester Freamon.
Where you workin'?
Pawn shop unit.
I mean, how you gonna shoot a police, yo?
Ain't no percentage in that, you know what I'm sayin'?
For real.
Somebody around here do that shit, you know every knocko in the world be down here, bustin' heads.
I guess them Park Heights nigga's just ain't got no fuckin' common sense.
A lotta heart, just no sense.
Hey, yo, Poot.
Wallace on the phone, yo.
- Yeah?
- Wallace?
Nigga ring me up twice a day whether he got shit to say or not.
Homesick motherfucker makin' me bug, yo.
Yo, where's he at, yo?
At the shore with his grandma, down there...
Probably surfing' or some bullshit.
Or something.
P.A. system:
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on line five.
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on line five.
(pager beeping)
(tires screeching)
You just use that phone?
Yeah, a little earlier, man.
Y'all might wanna go to Mosher Street.
- Just now, you used it?
- Yeah.
Man downtown needs to talk to you.
Man downtown?
Okay, make some sense for me, please, all right?
I ain't been so clean in my whole damn life.
- Look, man, I'm just doin' my job.
- Okay.
What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?
Wallace:
Naw, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.
My grandmother on the bayside.
Still, man, you on vacation and not bringin' me with you.
How you get all the way down there, anyhow?
- I took a bus.
- Well, shit.
Tell me how to go and I grab a 'Hound, too.
Come down there and hang with your ass.
No, man, it ain't like that, yo.
The air down here all sticky.
Worse than Baltimore, yo.
And these crickets, louder than a motherfucker.
Can't get no sleep.
I don't think I'm cut out to be no country-ass nigga, man.
Operator:
Please deposit $2 for an additional...
- Shit, I gotta go.
- You can take a nigga up out the Westside,
- but you can't take-- - (dial tone)
What's your name?
Look, I didn't do shit here, okay?
I asked you your name.
Naw, this shit ain't right.
Who'd you try to page, shitbird?
Why the fuck do you care, okay?
I mean... you have exactly three more seconds to explain yourself to me, asshole.
One shooter definitely opened the passenger door, so any latent prints from that side of the car.
- I didn't do nothing, man!
- (thumping)
- Why'd you page her, shitbird?
!
- Get off me, man!
- Get off me!
- You think this is a fucking game?
!
I wanna talk to Detective Greggs.
- You can't, motherfucker.
- Then, McNulty then.
This shit ain't right, sir!
Savino, Savino.
Mope ain't around.
(dialing, ringing)
Yeah, one of them low-rise hopper's on tower phone two.
Okay.
(camera clicking)
Maybe he forgot the number.
(camera clicking)
What the fuck was that?
You don't know?
We just caught a re-up off a tower stash.
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.
(dialing, ringing)
Daniels:
Put that away.
Put that away and work the case.
Can I ask you something?
How much of this case would you give up to get her back?
That's not the point.
Well, how much?
All of it.
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.
I'm sitting here with a hospital progress report that shows no fucking progress.
She's not conscious, she's intubated.
She's had a trach and a lung collapse, and if she's got a shred of luck, the shot she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.
(phone ringing)
It wasn't worth it.
Homicide for McNulty on line two.
Do your job.
Yeah?
Bunk:
So how you doing with it?
I'll live.
Yeah?
Well, listen, Jimmy, we had a little dust-up over here.
Holley mighta beat one of your girl's CIs on spec.
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?
Yeah, that's him.
You might wanna roll past and squelch this shit before it gets outta hand.
Yeah.
- It ain't worth it, man.
- Naw.
It ain't worth it at 10 times the price.
A fucking cop, man.
A cop!
How stupid is this motherfucker?
!
If you see a bitch in the car, change it up.
We can go to Orlando another fuckin' day.
Savino say he was tryin' to signal, but he in the dark, he don't know where Bey's at, or where they comin' from.
Nothin' breakin' our way, man, damn.
We gotta burn this shit.
This is cop money, it's probably marked somehow.
The guns are in the sewer, Bey's a rock, so that's cool.
But it's the bitch cop.
If she wake up and start talkin', she gonna put Little Man in there, Bey in there.
- What up with Little Man?
- He's scared.
- He shot a cop.
- Fuck.
But I put Bey on that.
What about Savino?
Well, Savino, he gotta eat the charge, but he knew that.
So if he keep his story tight, he gonna be all right.
Yeah, we knew Orlando was a snitchin' motherfucker, man.
Fuck him, but this cash got us caught up.
I know, man, that's my fault, man.
Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that, yo, if they take Orlando, they can take the cash, too.
I was like, all right, y'all get your payday.
Yo, how the fuck is Orlando gonna front this type of cash?
What it say?
I know, I know.
I fucked up, I know.
A'ight, take this trash outside, fuckin' burn it.
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess before he jet.
He was throwin' 911 messages to her pager.
I asked him why, he raised up.
Shit got outta hand.
- Does he know?
- Uh-uh.
Bubbs:
Hey, McNulty, man.
What they doin' over there, man?
It's fucked up, they beating' on me.
Last night, she got shot.
Bubbs:
Where the fuck were you at?
- Where were you?
- I was there.
Hey, Bunk.
We got no good latents on the passenger side door.
What about the dash?
Call the lab.
So, what can I do?
Well, for one thing you can roll around the projects, see who's missing.
Who ain't around.
You okay with that?
Yeah, yeah, I just, um...
I been keepin' it kinda close, you know?
Ain't been around the projects much lately, you know what I'm sayin'?
You beefin' with someone down there?
Naw.
No, I'm not beefin' with...
Eyes open, Bubbs.
For Kima.
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.
Where are we with Savino?
Still MIA.
Enough of this bullshit.
Well, if he calls me for anything,
I'll tell him to turn himself in.
You know I'm going to do that.
- Not good enough.
- Excuse me?
We need him now.
No, thanks.
Perhaps as an officer of the court,
- you could endeavor to--
- Ronnie's being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe, so she's putting it into your twisted little language.
Me?
I wouldn't wipe my ass with a Baltimore lawyer, no offense.
None taken.
I mean, I'm willing to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury, and blow smoke up a judge's ass and jury-tamper your balls off without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition.
And fuck me if I don't let you structure your cash into briefcase fees, either.
That's between you and the IRS.
And neither one of you is anybody's friend, right?
I think what Jimmy is trying to say is--
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want me to keep my nose closed to your shit, then you're gonna have to throw me something when I need it, and right now I need Savino Bratton in bracelets.
I don't know where he is.
Well, you repped him the last four felonies.
I'm guessing you can get word to him if you want to.
A police may die, Maury, and Savino was there.
He comes in this afternoon he takes the drug charge at least.
Or what?
Or we send tactical teams into his momma's house every night, till there's no house left to worry about.
And you get a target letter from the state's attorney's office, followed by subpoenas for every fucking bank account in your fucking name and let's see if all those cash deposits match the reported income.
I'm hearing this from him, and I understand that he's distraught.
I understand that.
Am I hearing this from the state's attorney's office as well?
You are.
I'll see what I can do.
Fuck you, Jimmy!
You didn't tell me that was coming.
He'll bring him in.
He will if he can, that's not the point.
Well, what's the point?
The point is that Maury Levy is a past officer of the Monumental Bar Association, and unless I want to spend my whole life as a fucking ASA,
I can't spend my afternoons pissing on people who matter.
Another career in the balance.
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.
If only half you motherfuckers in the state's attorney's office didn't want to be judges, didn't want to be partners in some downtown law firm, if half of you had the fucking balls to follow through,
you know what would happen?
A guy like that would be indicted, tried and convicted.
And the rest of 'em would back up enough so we could push a clean case or two through your courthouse.
But no, everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.
And everybody's got a fucking future.
You'll just use anyone, won't you?
So, I've been searchin' the logs for pager hits that used an 0-7 code, right?
It comes up now and then on D'Angelo's pager.
Stringer's too, but less often.
Most of the time, there's nothing to place the guy, but check it.
And this is on Stringer's page?
It comes back to the pay phone in the emergency room at Maryland General Hospital.
Let me guess.
The date of this page is the same day that Stinkum got killed.
And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.
That was the talk on the wire, anyway.
You go to Maryland General and pull the ER records for that morning, you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.
0-7 is Wee-Bey, it's gotta be.
And we have Wee-Bey and Little Man at the pay phone at Park Heights
20 minutes after the ambush throwing a page to Stringer.
We're all over town for this piece-of-shit Savino.
With ties to the Barksdale organization?
- Yes, sir.
- What else?
Well, the case is progressing.
We're starting to glean some possible shooters from the wiretap.
You know, I asked for the controlled buy.
I put one of our people in harm's way.
So right now I want to make sure that we are doing everything.
We are, sir.
We're on it.
Good.
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.
Any addresses we can write on.
Anything connected to a narcotics case.
CID, Tactical, the deus, and tomorrow on the 6:00 news, we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.
A lot of it!
Dope on the table?
We need to let them know who we are.
We can't for one minute let them think that this will stand.
The commissioner wants to send a message, Lieutenant.
You make sure you and your people do everything possible to see that it is heard.
Dope on the damn table.
Hey, it's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?
Again, for the record, let's make clear that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized and that what is said at this juncture is for purposes of a proffer.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Okay, then.
Here you go.
That's baking soda.
Which Mr. Bratton intended to sell to Orlando Blocker.
You can keep it with our compliments.
Where's the money?
Mr. Bratton did not receive money.
He left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.
If you were recording the transaction, the tape will confirm this.
And he wasn't around for the shooting either.
In fact, he doesn't know who the shooters are.
Jay:
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck that he left them in an dead-end alley and they were shot-to-shit just two minutes later.
This is bullshit!
A police is down.
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer.
And no intention of doing anything other than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.
Ms. Nathan?
No charge if he gives us the shooters.
And if he testifies, we'll find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program.
As I indicated, Mr. Bratton has no idea who shot Mr. Blocker or the undercover officer.
Best you can do is 286-B.
What the hell is that?
Distribution of sham CDS, three year maximum,
$5,000 fine.
That's it?
If he took the cash, we could go to felony theft or fraud, but the tape has him leaving the money.
Three years.
A cop was shot, Maury.
So if we convict, he'll do every damn day of the three.
I can do the three, ain't no thing.
Bunk:
And the $5,000 fine?
Oh, shit, you still up 25, right?
Nicely done.
Gimme two, yo.
(radio playing)
Damn, Orlando, yo.
I still can't believe that shit.
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?
He ran a club for my uncle, yo.
Yeah?
Yeah, first Stink, and now him.
Yeah, man, and I heard the cop's been all in Savino's shit, too.
- He ain't been around.
- Little Man, neither.
Somebody could get to cleaning' up shit around here.
True.
You can't just be goin' around, droppin' five-O like that, yo.
You know how your uncle is when people get to fuckin' up, man.
He start takin' that shit personal, man.
Look like a couple more nigga's gonna get dropped.
- Yo, what up?
- You Dee?
Yeah.
They sayin' you need to get with Stringer, right away, yo.
See?
You movin' up in the world.
As long as you don't fall in with the trash they takin' out.
Yeah, whatever, nigga.
I'll be right back.
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.
Ain't answerin' his page, neither.
See?
I'm not gonna lie.
She's got swelling around the vertebrae from a through-and-through, and some indications of partial paralysis.
That might go away when the swelling goes down.
And it might not either.
Her family is with her.
What the fuck is up with homicide?
Are we on the shooters yet?
They're working it hard.
The departmental response is gonna be to take doors tomorrow morning.
Citywide.
Every unit, every district is kicking in any drug-connected address they can write on.
We're gonna do the same.
Lieutenant, is that--
Except... we're gonna hold back on the main stash, the house up in northwest we tracked off the wire.
For one thing, we advance this case more by sitting on that location.
For another, raids that are too much on the bulls-eye will have Barksdale changing up.
We might blow the wire altogether.
We got two addresses in the low-rises that are probables, and another two rowhouses off the avenue that have been used for stash as recently as last week.
But this... this here is the best bet for a good rip.
Herc picked up on it yesterday.
Fourth-floor, end unit on the south side of the 221.
They're droppin' the re-ups out the window to the hoppers who run it off.
What if they change up the apartment?
Well, they do that every day.
Yesterday was the fifth floor on the north side.
We're gonna have a man on the church watching with a cellphone.
They change up, we call the duty judge who orally amends the warrant.
We hit everything at 1100 hours.
But the squad that takes the high-rise needs to stage at 0500.
We need to be inside before the building even wakes up.
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight, he needs to start typing his ass off right now.
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?
You goin' with Bey.
Hey, yo, Bey.
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.
Goin' where?
What the fuck you waitin' for?
(muffled talking)
Stop bullshitting' me!
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.
The deputy.
We grab a senator's bag man in the projects, he knows that.
State police come in here with a cooperator, he knows that, too.
- It's like fucking clockwork.
- He's got a rat.
Here, in the detail.
In the beginning, when we started, Burrell had me.
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.
- But now...
- He lost you.
So now he's picked up someone else.
That's how they do.
(chattering)
(laughing)
Can we talk?
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.
What now?
We're on a prime location.
Barksdale's stash.
Instead of sitting on it and making cases off it, he wants us to write a paper and take the door.
- Why?
- Dope on the table.
It's a photo op to make us all feel better about Kima Greggs catching a bullet or two.
Oh, Christ.
You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.
Uh...
I don't know, Jimmy.
You back on the ticket, huh?
It was just the usual bullshit.
They're just, um, dickin' me around, trying to get another black face on the ticket, make it four-and-one to even up for the last time.
The governor had to promise two new appointments, so now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.
That's all?
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.
It has nothing to do with your case.
I need you on this.
So, who's my daddy now?
(music playing)
I just do what the fuck they tell me, you know?
It ain't on me to know what the fuck they have in mind.
Look, Bey.
Now it come down to this crazy shit.
Yo, turn in this alley right here.
Right there.

This dude is crazy.

- Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.
Man, get in here.
Go ahead, man.
What's wrong with you?
Check it out, Dee.
I need you to feed 'em while I'm gone.
You gonna give 'em different food for each tank, too, all right?
But don't worry, I'm gonna show you what to do, c'mere.
These are my tetras.
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey and Jezebel in here somewhere.
I don't know, she think she cute.
You take two pinches of whatever food
I got next to each tank.
They set for the day.
You see, they ain't no problems.
Just beautiful as hell, Dee.
I'm gonna go upstairs, and pack some shit.
Yo, Bey!
Where we goin', man?
Philly.
You gonna take the truck back, but first I got to go upstairs, grab some shit, show you what to do with my tanks, right?

No Savino, no Little Man, no Wee-Bey either.
And the Barksdale kid from the pit he's out the mix, too.
You think it was them that did it?
McNulty:
Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.
Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers and miles of NCIC bullshit.
Warrants for blood and hair, too.
It's Bey and Little Man, shooter one and shooter two.
I feel it, Bunk.
Yeah, well, right now, we need our girl to wake up and say so.
All right.
You did good, Bubbs.
McNulty, you know, um... the situation is different for me.
- I mean, for me, I'm--
- Mount up.
I gotta go.
Prez will get you a ride, okay?
(helicopter hovering)
Move out.
(tires screeching)
Man:
Five-O, five-O!
- Police, police!
- Go, go, go!
Show your hands, asshole!
- Down on the ground.
- Move it, move it!
McNulty, Freamon, check the basement.
- Clear?
- All clear.
- Bathroom's clear.
- Check the mattress.
Check under the bed, check all the drawers, check every fucking inch of this room.
- Got anything?
- No.
- Bingo.
- Look at this.
Got it.
There she goes.
Bag it.
Let's do it.
(cameras clicking)
That's fine police work, Erv.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you see on the table in front of you, represents our department's answer to a culture of death and drugs.
And when an officer falls in this war, others stand ready to take up the challenge and carry the fight to the very doorstep of those responsible.
Now this is only the beginning, I can assure you.
But today, a message has been sent.
And believe me, this message is being heard loud and clear by all those who seek profit and power in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.
Slow.
Bullshit on the McCulloh street phone, nothing on the towers.
Who's on the rooftop?
No one.
Fuck it.
Wallace:
Hey, yo, where the money, man?
Man:
How much you need?
Wallace:
Yo, the bus cost like 18, man.
Man:
Your grandma ain't got it?
Wallace:
I ask her, she gonna try to stop me from booking'.
I'm tellin' you, boy, this country-ass shit got me all messed up.
I'm sayin' you need to send me something for the bus, yo.
I'm dyin' here, all broke and shit.
Man:
Yeah, I feel you.
Well, when do you want to come home?
Wallace:
When the fucking money get here.
Man:
All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.
(machines beeping)
(theme music playing)
How many shells you got?
Come on, come on!
Another bag here.
Christ.
Sergeant?
Yeah?
Who are the primaries?
Cole and Norris.
Cole's here... and Norris is at the hospital.
What do you need?
Room to work.
I keep ordering people off the scene... and between Narcotics, DEA and the two districts... we keep collecting more and more bodies around here.
Nobody move!
I said, nobody fucking move!
If you haven't been assigned a specific task by a homicide detective... you need to step away from this crime scene.
Is there anybody doesn't understand a direct order?
If you have not specifically been instructed otherwise... then remove your useless interfering asses from the area.
Now!
Slow this thing down to a crawl.
Give these bastards no chance to fuck up in a meaningful way.
Okay.
Wedged all the way to the back.
She couldn't get to it.
She taped it up front... but as soon as she put any weight on these worn-ass car seats... they pulled the tape off.
Gun slid back behind the mesh as they drove, probably.
Christ.
Where was her support?
There were two follow cars several blocks distant.
She got turned around in the alleys.
She gave her 20 as the north side of Warwick.
They went there on the shots?
The Foxtrot finally found her.
Hey, you got to be moving outta here.
So, we had two units covering the north side... and a helicopter up on top.
And no one saw any vehicles in flight.
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, come on.
What the fuck happened?
You didn't have an eyeball?
On those streets, there's no way you can eyeball it.
-She threw out 20s as best she could.
-Understood, I'm just asking.
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton.
A minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.
I gave your people that at the scene.
We're hitting his last knowns.
The set-up was more than him.
The casings are different calibers, and her Glock was full up.
-How bad?
-Chest wound, no exit.
Through and through to the throat.
She wasn't stabilized.
They had the pressure pants on her.
Trying to push up the pulse.
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.
You're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?
-Warwick, I think.
-Okay.
You've got the east well-covered...
-to the west is the rail bed.
-What did Foxtrot see?
Nothing moving except our units.
Lieutenant...
I know just how you feel.
This is the toughest job a police commissioner has.
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
This is Lieutenant Daniels.
Right, of course.
This entire department stands behind Detective Greggs... in every possible way.
I just thought you should know that.
Yes, sir.
Jaybird.
We have a runner.
Yeah, we're gonna need casts of these two imprints.
Put the lab tech on it.
1 1-39.
The money's not anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.
I'm not going to be standing... giving a shit about the money when you have lost... one of your own who might....
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.
-If we can get to this Savino character--
-Hey.
Fuck your money.
Jimmy?
You hurt?
No.
It's hers.
Come on, get up.
Let's go, up with you.
Come on.
Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.
She went into the ambo that way.
Is she....
What the fuck did I do?
Come on, walk.
What's that?
What's our plan, Ray?
Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office typing warrants for Savino.
-Who's on the autopsy?
-Me, I'm at the morgue.
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma in case she sits up and talks.
We're laser printing the car, right?
'Course, Worden's on that.
You're in command for the city, right?
Major Rawls, Homicide.
Anything you need from my office... men, money, whatever, you just ask.
Right.
Cooperator, your girl's down in shock trauma.
Let's get to work.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
We got a wire up.
So?
So we got a wire up on some motherfucker that just shot a cop.
If somebody talks, and gets on the wrong phone... says the wrong thing about what happened... where the fuck do you want to be?
Church roof?
Yeah, you and me.
Sydnor takes the McCullough Street phone.
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?
Shit.
I'll do that first, then meet you at the church.
Bunk, Mike.
Wonder who that bitch was.
-Always some shit, right?
-Yeah.
-Done?
-Done.
All right.
Let's get outta here.
Yeah.
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.
1-39.
11-35.
Can I get 18-1 2 up here?
Yeah.
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit, or even comes near it... until the tech does his recovery.
Hello.
He stopped running.
Either he got tired or--
Or he got into a car.
Right.
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 11-34.
I'm in the... 3000 block of Landvale.
Backing up to the CSX bed.
I need a lab unit, and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.
A jackhammer?
Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.
Alive.
In the OR.
My people at the scene have heard this.
-It's a copy of the original.
-Okay.
We brought a machine--
-Where the fuck is--
-Sir.
Here it is, here.
Yeah, put it there.
Don't fuck with this count.
Don't fuck with this count.
That's Savino.
I'll be right back with your shit.
Where are we?
That sign said Longwood, but I could swear this is Warwick.
Hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with you all.
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley, I don't know, shit... half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
I hope you all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?
He better not be long, 'cause I don't know where the stash is... and if they dragging us all over this part of town--
What's that?
Jesus.
-Something ain't right.
-What?
This shit ain't right.
Christ.
Signal 13, signal 13.
What the fuck?
She can't reach the gun.
-What the fuck?
-Two males, black hoodies, both of them--
Shut it off.
Shut it off.
Dr. Mells, Line 6.
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.
You played a lot of fucking cards and made a lot of people... do a lot of fucking things they didn't want to do.
This is true.
We both know this is true.
Dr. Ralston, please call cardiology.
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here... and say you did a single fucking thing to get a police shot.
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?
This is not on you.
No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.
And the motherfucker saying this... he hates your guts, McNulty.
So you know if it was on you...
I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.
That's the only lesson here.
Police!
Police, let me see your hands.
-Get on the ground!
-Down on the ground!
Search warrant, get on the ground.
Police, get down.
Let's see your hands.
-He ain't here!
-Who ain't here?
-Zach, he ain't here!
-Zach?
No, honey, we're looking for Savino.
Savino?
No, he's my baby.
Yeah, your baby shot a cop.
They're kicking in the doors, looking for Savino.
-What?
What up with that, man?
-Some shit about he killed a cop.
Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.
They kicking in the doors, acting like he did it.
-Shit.
-I'm telling you, man.
They're talking about it anyway.
Ripples in the pond.
Talking ain't knowing, is it?
Skin this cat another way.
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?
Only this one after the shooting.
Who's 07?
And what phone is he asking for Stringer to call him back?
-Shit went good, but--
-Hold on.
Officer was shot around 12.:30 this morning.
The officer may have been undercover.
-All right, talk.
-Like I said, it went good... except there was this bitch curled up in the back seat.
Surprised the shit out of us.
Didn't even see her until the shit popped off.
I mean if it was up to me, I'd have let the girl walk.
She didn't look like the talking type.
But Little Man seen her, bugged out, and let a couple go.
-Savino didn't tip y'all off to her?
-Wasn't no time for that.
He get up out the car, we see him go up the block...
like we said, right?
After that, he out of sight and we bring it home like we planned, baby.
Shorty was a cop.
And she ain't dead.
Where'd you all put the guns?
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's hos.
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?
-A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
-What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?
I mean, this motherfucker bugged out one time.
He gonna bug out again, when he find out shorty's a fucking cop?
I mean, come on, man.
Savino got a story that he can keep to and he know it... but Little Man, he always been fucking weak like that.
Little Man gotta go.
You hear me?
This shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me?
We gotta fall back.
I wanna see how it go with this Savino bullshit... see how they go past that.
But if the shit don't hold... or if this motherfucking cop wake up and start talking shit... then you gotta go sky up.
Where you got your peoples at?
New York.
Jersey, Cleveland.
All right.
So, Philly.
DC.
You know what I'm saying?
No profile, no connections, no noise.
You feel me, right?
All right.
We gotta be careful.
Jesus.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's all right, you just scared me.
I work with Kima.
Kima, she....
Kima's at work.
What is she?
Dust the receiver, the coin return, and the metal top.
The can, too.
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station, please.
We can't really know for sure.
Lieutenant.
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and--
Maybe somebody from the department or the city... maybe might want to say something.
Who's here from the family?
A daughter, you say?
A daughter?
Officer Greggs has a girl?
A roommate.
The family's in Richmond, driving up first thing today... but the roommate's already here.
I'll do it myself.
No problem.
If we lose her, he can always pose for the funeral.
Still need the right door for Savino.
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama, all empty holes.
Tracers picked up a of couple hairs on one of the hoodies.
That's something.
So, either these guys are neighborhood yos... who lucked into $30,000 on a street stickup, or....
Or they're pros who set up in an alley on one side of the tracks... then slip over to the other side... where they park their ride.
What about the post?
Cause and manner of death on Mr. Blocker is homicide... to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder, chest and left arm.
Nine millimeter, six left twist, suitable for comparison.
We pulled something else from the back seat of the car, right?
Yeah, .380.
Semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.
So, we confirmed the two shooters.
Print hit.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice, enforcer in the 221 ... a definite connect to Barksdale's world.
Print hit?
Print hit from what?
Soda can.
Dropped at the pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere.
Still had a little fizz in it when I got there.
What is this pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere?
It's from which some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell... 20 minutes after the shooting.
I dusted the phone, too, but it was smudged.
So we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest... ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.
So much for the amateur-hour theory.
Good pull.
You are?
Freamon.
Lester Freamon.
Where you working?
Pawn shop unit.
I mean, how you gonna shoot a police?
Ain't no percentage in that, know what I'm saying?
For real.
Someone around here do that shit... every narco in the world be down here busting heads.
I guess them Park Heights niggers just ain't got no fucking common sense.
A lotta heart, just no sense.
Poot.
Wallace on the phone.
-Yeah?
-Wallace?
Nigger ring me up twice a day whether he got shit to say or not.
-Homesick motherfucker making me bug.
-Where's he at?
At the shore with his grandma, down there....
Surfing or some bullshit.
Or something.
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on Line 5.
You just use that phone?
Yeah, a little earlier.
-You might wanna go to Mosher Street.
-Just now, you used it?
Yeah.
-A man downtown needs to talk to you.
-Man downtown?
Make some sense for this man, please.
All right?
-I ain't never been so clean in my life.
-I'm just doing my job.
Okay.
What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?
No, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.
My grandmother on the bayside.
Still, man, you on vacation and not bringing me with you.
How you get all the way down there?
I took a bus.
Shit, tell me how to go, and I grab a 'hound, too.
Come down there and hang with your ass.
No, man, it ain't like that.
The air down here all sticky.
Worse than Baltimore.
And these crickets, louder than a motherfucker.
I can't get no sleep.
I don't think I'm cut out to be no country-ass nigger, man.
Please deposit two dollars for an additional two minutes.
Shit, I gotta go.
You can take a nigger out the Westside.
But you can't take--
What's your name?
Look, I didn't do shit here, okay?
I asked you your name.
No, this shit ain't right.
Who'd you try to page, shit bird?
Why the fuck do you care, okay?
I mean....
You have exactly three more seconds to explain yourself to me, asshole.
One shooter definitely opened the passenger door... so any latent prints from that side of the car....
-Why'd you page her, shit bird?
-Get off me.
You think this is a fucking game?
I wanna talk to Detective Greggs.
-You can't, motherfucker.
-Then McNulty then.
This shit ain't right, sir.
Savino.
Mope ain't around.
One of them low-rise hoppers... on Tower Phone 2.
Okay.
Maybe he forgot the number.
The fuck was that?
You don't know?
We just caught a re-up off the tower stash.
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.
Put that away.
Put that away and work the case.
Can I ask you something?
How much of this case would you give up to get her back?
That's not the point.
How much?
All of it.
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.
I'm sitting with a hospital progress report that shows no fucking progress.
She's not conscious, she's intubated.
She's had a trach and a lung collapse... and if she's got a shred of luck... the shot she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.
It wasn't worth it.
Homicide for McNulty on Line 2.
Do your job.
Yeah?
So how you doing with it?
I'll live.
Yeah?
Listen, Jimmy.
We had a little dust-up over here.
Holley might have beat one of your girl's Cls on spec.
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?
Yeah, that's him.
You might wanna roll past and squelch this shit... before it gets outta hand.
Yeah.
It ain't worth it, man.
It ain't worth it at 10 times the price.
A fucking cop, man.
A cop!
How stupid is this motherfucker?
If you see a bitch in the car, change it up.
We can go to Orlando another fucking day.
Savino say he was trying to signal, but he in the dark... he don't know where Bey's coming from.
Nothing breaking our way.
We gotta burn this shit.
This is cop money.
It's probably marked somehow.
The guns are in the sewer, Bey's a rock, so that's cool.
But it's the bitch cop.
If she starts talking, she gonna put Little Man and Bey in there.
What up with Little Man?
-He's scared.
He shot a cop.
-Fuck.
But I put Bey on that.
What about Savino?
Savino, he gotta eat the charge.
But he knew that.
So if he keep his story tight, he gonna be all right.
We knew Orlando was a snitching motherfucker, man.
Fuck him, but this is cash.
He got us caught up.
I know, man.
That's my fault, man.
Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that... if they take Orlando, they can take the cash, too.
I was like, all right, you all get your payday--
How the fuck is Orlando gonna front this type of cash?
What it say?
I know.
I know, I fucked up.
All right, take this trash outside, fucking burn it.
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess before he jet.
He was throwing 91 1 messages to her pager.
I asked him why.
He raised up.
Shit got outta hand.
Does he know?
McNulty, man.
What they doing over there, man?
He just started beating on me.
Last night, she got shot.
Where the fuck were you at?
-Where were you?
-I was there.
Bunk.
Holley is investigating.
We got no good latents on the passenger side door.
...and he sees her pager coming up 91 1 .
What about the dash?
You gotta help me!
Call the lab.
What can I do?
For one thing you can roll around the projects and see who's missing.
Who ain't around.
You okay with that?
Yeah, I just....
I been keeping it kinda close, you know?
Ain't been around the projects much lately.
You know what I'm saying?
You beefing with someone down there?
No, I'm not beefing with....
Eyes open, Bubbs.
For Kima.
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.
Where are we with Savino?
-Still MIA.
-Enough of this bullshit.
If he calls me for anything, I'll tell him to turn himself in.
-I'm going to do that.
-Not good enough.
Excuse me?
We need him now.
No, thanks.
Perhaps as an officer of the court...
Ronnie here is being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.
She's putting it into your twisted little language.
Me?
I wouldn't wipe my ass with a Baltimore lawyer.
No offense.
None taken.
I mean, I'm willing to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury... blow smoke up a judge's ass and jury-tamper your balls off... without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition.
Fuck me if I don't let you structure your cash into briefcase fees, either.
That's between you and the IRS.
Neither one of you is anyone's friend, right?
What Jimmy is trying to say is--
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want my nose closed to your shit... you have to throw me something when I need it.
And right now I need Savino Bratton in bracelets.
I don't know where he is.
You repped him the last four felonies.
I guess you can get word to him if you want to.
A police may die, Morrie, and Savino was there.
He comes in this afternoon... and he takes the drug charge at least.
Or what?
Or we send tactical teams into his momma's house every night... until there's no house left to worry about.
You get a target letter from the state's attorney's office... followed by subpoenas for every bank account... in your fucking name.
And let's see if all those cash deposits match the reported income.
I'm hearing this from him... and I understand that he's distraught.
I understand that.
Am I hearing this from the state's attorney's office as well?
You are.
I'll see what I can do.
Fuck you, Jimmy!
-You didn't tell me that was coming.
-He'll bring him in.
-He will if he can, that's not the point.
-What's the point?
The point is that Morrie Levy is a past officer of the Monumental Bar Association... and unless I want to spend my whole life as a fucking ASA...
I can't spend my afternoons pissing on people who matter.
Another career in the balance.
-Fuck you.
-No, fuck you.
If only half of you in the state's attorney's office... didn't want to be judges... didn't want to be partners in a downtown law firm... if you had the balls to follow through, you know what would happen?
A guy like that would be indicted, tried and convicted.
The rest of them would back up... so we could push a clean case through your courthouse.
But no, everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.
And everybody's got a fucking future.
You'll just use anyone, won't you?
I've been searching the logs for pager hits that used an 07 code, right?
It comes up now and then on D'Angelo's pager.
Stringer's, too, but less often.
Most of the time, there's nothing to place the guy... but check it.
-And this is on Stringer's page?
-It comes back to the pay phone... in the emergency room at Maryland General Hospital.
Let me guess.
The date of this page is the same day that Stinkum got killed.
And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.
That was the talk on the wire, anyway.
If you go to Maryland General and pull the ER records for that morning... you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.
07 is Wee-Bey.
It's gotta be.
And we have Wee-Bey and Little Man at the pay phone at Park Heights... 20 minutes after the ambush... throwing a page to Stringer.
We're all over town for this piece-of-shit Savino.
With ties to the Barksdale organization?
-Yes, sir.
-What else?
The case is progressing.
We're gleaning possible shooters from the wiretap.
I asked for the controlled buy.
I put one of our people in harm's way.
So right now I want to make sure that we are doing everything.
-We are, sir, we're on it.
-Good.
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.
Any addresses we can write on, anything connected to a narcotics case.
CID, tactical, the deus... and tomorrow, on the 6:00 news... we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.
A lot of it.
Dope on the table?
We need to let them know who we are.
We can't for one minute let them think that this will stand.
The Commissioner wants to send a message, Lieutenant.
You make sure you and your people... do everything possible to see that it is heard.
Dope on the damn table.
It's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?
Again, for the record, let's make clear that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized... and that what is said here is for purposes of a proffer.
-Agreed?
-Agreed.
Okay, then.
Here you go.
That's baking soda.
Which Mr. Bratton intended to sell to Orlando Blocker.
You can keep it with our compliments.
Where's the money?
Mr. Bratton did not receive money.
He left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.
If you were recording the transaction, the tape will confirm this.
And he wasn't around for the shooting either.
He doesn't know who the shooters are.
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck... that he left them in an dead-end alley and they were shot... just two minutes later.
This is bullshit.
A police is down.
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer.
And no intention of doing anything other than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.
Ms. Nathan?
No charge if he gives us the shooters.
And if he testifies... we'll find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program.
As I indicated...
Mr. Bratton has no idea who shot Mr. Blocker... or the undercover officer.
Best you can do is 286B.
What the hell is that?
Distribution of sham CDS.
Three-year maximum, $5,000 fine.
That's it?
If he took the cash, we could go to felony theft or fraud... but the tape has him leaving the money.
Three years.
A cop was shot, Morrie.
So if we convict, he'll do every damn day of the three.
I can do the three.
Ain't no thing.
And the $5,000 fine?
Shit, you still up $25,000, right?
Nicely done.
Give me two.
Damn, Orlando.
I still can't believe that shit.
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?
-He ran a club for my uncle.
-Yeah?
Yeah, first Stink, and now him.
Yeah, man, and I heard the cops been all in Savino's shit, too.
-He ain't been around.
-Little Man, neither.
Somebody could get to cleaning up shit around here.
True.
You can't just be going around, dropping 5-0 like that.
You know how your uncle is when people get to fucking up, man.
He starts taking that shit personal, man.
Look like a couple more niggers gonna get dropped.
What up?
You Dee?
Yeah.
They say you need to get with Stringer, right away.
See?
You moving up in the world.
As long as you don't fall in with the trash they taking out.
Yeah, whatever, nigger.
I'll be right back.
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.
Ain't answering his page, neither.
See?
I'm not gonna lie.
She has swelling around the vertebrae... and some indications of partial paralysis.
That may or may not go away when the swelling goes down.
Her family is with her.
What the fuck is up with Homicide?
Are we on the shooters yet?
They're working it hard.
The departmental response is gonna be to take doors tomorrow morning.
Citywide.
Every unit, every district is kicking in... any drug-connected address they can write on.
We're gonna do the same.
-Lieutenant, is that--
-Except... we're gonna hold back on the main stash.
The house up in northwest we tracked off the wire....
We advance this case more by sitting on that location.
And raids that are too much on the bulls-eye... will have Barksdale changing up.
We might blow the wire altogether.
We got two addresses in the low-rises that are probables... and another two row houses... that have been used for stash as recently as last week.
But this.... this here is the best bet for a good rip.
Herc picked up on it yesterday.
Fourth-floor... end unit on the south side of the 221 .
They're dropping the re-ups out the window... to the hoppers who run it off.
What if they change up the apartment?
They do that every day.
Yesterday was the fifth floor on the north side.
We'll have a man on the church with a cell phone.
They change up, we call the duty judge who orally amends the warrant.
We hit everything at 1 1 :00.
The squad that takes the high-rise needs to stage at 5:00.
We need to be inside before the building even wakes up.
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight needs to start typing his ass off right now.
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?
You going with Bey.
Bey.
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.
Going where?
What the fuck you waiting for?
Stop bullshitting me.
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.
The Deputy.
We grab a senator's bag man in the projects, he knows that.
State Police bring in a cooperator, he knows it, too.
Like fucking clockwork.
He's got a rat.
Here, in the detail.
In the beginning... when we started, Burrell had me.
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.
But now he lost you.
So now he's picked up someone else.
That's how they do.
Can we talk?
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.
What now?
We're on a prime location.
Barksdale's stash.
Instead of making cases, he wants us to write a paper and take the door.
-Why?
-Dope on the table.
It's a photo op to make us feel better about Kima Greggs catching a bullet or two.
Christ.
You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.
I don't know, Jimmy.
You back on the ticket, huh?
It was just the usual bullshit.
They're just dicking me around... trying to get another black face, make it four-and-one... to even up for the last time.
The Governor had to promise two new appointments.
So now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.
That's all?
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.
It has nothing to do with your case.
I need you on this.
So, who's my daddy now?
I just do what the fuck they tell me, you know?
It ain't on me to know what the fuck they have in mind.
Look, Bey.
Now it come down to this crazy shit.
Turn in this alley right here.
Right there.
What the fuck you stopping for?
Go!
Inside, man.
Let's go.
This dude is crazy.
Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.
Man, get in here.
Go ahead, man.
What's wrong with you?
Check it out, Dee.
I need you to feed them while I'm gone.
You gonna give them different food for each tank, too, all right?
But don't worry.
I'm gonna show you what to do.
Come here.
These are my Tetras.
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey and Jezebel in here somewhere.
I don't know, she think she cute.
You take two pinches of whatever food I got next to each tank.
They set for the day.
You see, they ain't no problems.
Just beautiful as hell, Dee.
I'm gonna go upstairs, and pack some shit.
Bey.
Where we going, man?
Philly.
You gonna take the truck back... but first I got to go upstairs, grab some shit, show you what to do with my tanks, right?
Philly?
We shot a narco, Dee.
No Savino.
No Little Man, no Wee-Bey, either.
And the Barksdale kid from the Pit... he's out the mix, too.
You think it was them that did it?
Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.
Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers... and miles of NCIC bullshit.
Warrants for blood and hair, too.
It's Bey and Little Man, shooter one and two.
I feel it, Bunk.
Yeah?
Right now, we need our girl to wake up... and say so.
All right.
You did good, Bubbs.
McNulty, you know... the situation is different for me.
-I mean, for me, I'm--
-Mount up.
I gotta go.
Prez will get you a ride, okay?
Move out.
Police.
Police!
Go!
Show your hands, asshole!
Down on the ground.
Move it, move it!
McNulty, Freamon, check the basement.
-Clear?
-All clear.
-Bathroom's clear.
-Check the mattress.
Check under the bed, check all the drawers, check every fucking inch of this room.
-Got anything?
-No.
Bingo.
Got it.
There she goes.
Bag it.
Let's do it.
That's fine police work, Erv.
Ladies and gentlemen... what you see on the table in front ofyou... represents our department's answer to a culture of death and drugs.
And when an officer falls in this war... others stand ready to pick up the challenge... and carry the fight to the very doorstep of those responsible.
This is only the beginning, I can assure you.
But today, a message has been sent.
And believe me, this message is being heard loud and clear... by all those who seek profit and power... in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.
Slow.
Bullshit on the McCullough Street phone, nothing on the towers.
Who's on the rooftop?
No one.
Fuck it.
Where's the money, man?
-How much you need?
-The bus cost like $18, man.
Your grandma ain't got it?
If I ask her, she gonna try to stop me from booking.
I'm telling you, boy.
This country-ass shit got me all messed up.
I'm saying, you need to send me something for the bus.
Yeah, I feel you.
-When do you want to come home?
-When the money get here.
All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.
Come on!
Another bag here.
Christ.
- Sergeant?
- Yeah?
- Who are the primaries?
- Cole and Norris.
Cole's here... and Norris is at the hospital.
- What do you need?
- Room to work.
I keep ordering people off the scene, and between Narcotics, DEA and the two districts, we keep collecting more and more bodies around here.
Nobody move!
I said nobody fucking move!
If you have not been assigned a task by a Homicide detective, step away from this crime scene.
Is there anybody doesn't understand a direct order?
If you have not specifically been instructed otherwise, then remove your useless, interfering asses from the area.
Now!
Slow this thing down to a crawl.
Give these bastards no chance to fuck up in a meaningful way.
- Wedged all the way to the back.
- She couldn't get to it.
She taped it up front.
But as soon as she put any weight on these worn-ass car seats, they pulled the tape off.
Gun slid back behind the mesh as they drove, probably.
Christ.
- Where was her support?
- There were two cars several blocks distant.
She got turned around in the alleys.
She gave her 20 at the north side of Warwick.
They went there on the shots?
Foxtrot finally found her.
So, we had two units covering the north side and a helicopter up on top, and no one saw any vehicles in flight.
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, come on.
What the fuck happened?
You didn't have an eyeball?
On those streets, there's no way you can eyeball it.
- She threw out 20s as best she could.
- Understood, I'm just asking.
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton, a minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.
- I gave you people all that.
- We're hitting his last-knowns.
The set-up was more than him.
The casings are different calibres and her Glock was full up.
- How bad?
- Chest wound, no exit.
Through and through to the throat.
They had the pressure pants on her to push up the pulse.
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.
You're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?
- Warwick, I think.
- OK.
You've got the east well covered.
- To the west is the rail bed.
- What did Foxtrot see?
- Nothing moving except our units.
- Lieutenant.
I know just how you feel.
This is the toughest job a police commissioner has.
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
This is Lieutenant Daniels.
Right, of course.
This entire department stands behind Detective Greggs in every possible way.
- I just thought you should know that.
- Yes, sir.
Jaybird.
We have a runner.
Yeah, we're gonna need casts of these two imprints.
Put the lab tech on it.
The money's not anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.
I won't give a shit about the money when you have lost one of your own who might...
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.
- But if we can get to this Savino character...
- Hey.
Fuck your money.
Jimmy?
You hurt?
It's hers.
Come on, get up.
Let's go.
Up with you.
She couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.
She went into the ambo that way.
Is she...?
- What the fuck did I do?
- Come on, walk.
What's that?
- What's our plan, Ray?
- Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office typing warrants.
- Who's on the autopsy?
- Me, I'm at the morgue.
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma in case she sits up and talks.
- We're laser printing the car, right?
- Course.
Worden's on that.
- You're in command for the city, right?
- Major Rawls, Homicide.
Anything you need from my office - men, money, whatever - you just ask.
Right.
Cooperator, your girl's down in shock trauma.
- Let's get to work.
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?
We got a wire up.
- So?
We got a wire up on some motherfucker that shot a cop.
If somebody says the wrong fucking thing about what happened, where the fuck do you want to be?
Church roof?
Yeah, you and me.
Sydnor takes the McCullough Street phone.
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?
Shit.
I'll do that first and meet you at the church.
Bunk, Mike.
Wonder who that bitch was.
- Always some shit, right?
- Yeah.
- Done?
- Done.
All right.
Let's get outta here.
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.
Can I get 18-12 up here?
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit, or even comes near it, till the tech does his recovery.
Hello.
- He stopped running.
- Either he got tired or...
- Or he got into a car.
- Right.
- 11-34.
- Go ahead, 11-34.
I'm in the... 3000 block of Landvale, backing up to the CSX bed.
I need a lab unit and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.
- A jackhammer?
- Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.
- Alive.
In the OR.
- My people at the scene have heard this.
It's a copy of the original.
- We brought a machine...
Where the fuck is...
- Sir.
Here it is.
- Don't fuck with this count.
- That's Savino.
I'll be right back with your shit.
Where are we?
That sign said Longwood but I could swear this is Warwick.
The hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with you all.
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley, I don't know, shit... half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
I hope you all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?
He better not be long cos I don't know where the stash is, and if they dragging us all over this part of town...
- What's that?
- Jesus.
- Something ain't right.
This shit ain't right.
- Christ.
Signal 13, signal 13.
- Where the fuck?
- She can't reach the gun.
- What the fuck?
- Two males, black hoodies, both armed...
Shut it off.
Shut it off.
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.
You played a lot of fucking cards and made a lot of people do a lot of fucking things they didn't want to do.
This is true.
We both know this is true.
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here and say you did a single fucking thing to get a police shot.
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?
This is not on you.
No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.
And the motherfucker saying this... he hates your guts, McNulty.
So you know if it was on you, I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.
That's the only lesson here.
Police!
Police, let me see your hands.
- Hands on your head!
- Down on the ground!
Search warrant, get on the ground.
Police.
Get down.
Let's see your hands.
- He ain't here!
- Who ain't here?
- Zach, he ain't here!
- Zach?
- No, honey, we're looking for Savino.
- Savino?
No, he's my baby.
Yeah, well, your baby shot a cop.
They're kicking in the doors, looking for Savino.
- What up with that, man?
- Some shit about he killed a cop.
Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.
They acting like he did it.
- Shit.
- I'm telling you, man.
- They're talking about it anyway.
- Ripples in the pond.
Talking ain't knowing, is it?
Skin this cat another way.
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?
Only this one after the shooting.
Who's 07?
And what phone is he asking for Stringer to call him back?
- Shit went good but...
- Hold on.
The officer may have been undercover.
- All right, talk.
- Like I said, it went good.
Except there was this bitch in the back seat.
Surprised the shit out of us.
Didn't even see her until the shit popped off.
I mean if it was up to me, I'd have let the girl walk.
She ain't look like the talking type.
But Little Man seen her, bugged out and let a couple go.
- Savino didn't tip y'all off?
- Wasn't no time.
He get up out the car, we see him go up the block like we said, right?
After that, he out of sight and we bring it home like we planned, baby.
Shorty was a cop.
And she ain't dead.
Where'd you all put the guns?
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's hos.
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?
- A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
- What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?
This motherfucker bugged out one time.
He gonna bug out again when he find out shorty's a fucking cop?
Come on, man.
Savino got a story that he can keep to and he know it.
But Little Man, he always been fucking weak like that.
Little Man gotta go.
You hear me?
This shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me?
We gotta fall back.
I wanna see how it go with this Savino bullshit, see how they go past that.
But if the shit don't hold or if this cop wake up and start talking shit, then you gotta go sky up.
Where you got your peoples at?
New York, Jersey, Cleveland.
All right.
So, Philly?
DC?
You know what I'm saying?
No profile, no connections, no noise.
You feel me, right?
All right.
We gotta be careful.
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.
It's all right, you just scared me.
I work with Kima.
- Kima, she...
- Kima's at work.
What are you...
Dust the receiver, the coin return and the metal top.
The can, too.
We can't really know for sure.
Lieutenant?
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and...
Maybe somebody from the department or the city might want to say something.
Who's here from the family?
A daughter, you say?
- A daughter?
- Officer Greggs has a girl?
A roommate.
The family's in Richmond, driving up first thing.
The roommate's already here.
I'll do it myself.
No problem.
If we lose her, he can always pose for the funeral.
Still need the right door for Savino.
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama.
Nothing.
Tracers picked up a of couple hairs on one of the hoodies.
So either these guys are neighbourhood yos who lucked into $30,000 on a street stick-up, or...
Or they're pros who set up in an alley on one side of the tracks then slip over to the other side, where they park their ride.
What about the post?
Cause and manner of death on Mr Blocker is homicide, to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder, chest and left arm.
Nine millimetre, six left twist, suitable for comparison.
We pulled something else from the back seat of the car?
Yeah,.380.
Semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.
So we confirmed the two shooters.
Print hit.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice, enforcer in the 221 and a definite connect to Barksdale's world.
Print hit?
Print hit from what?
Soda can.
Dropped at the pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere.
Still had fizz in it when I got there.
What is this pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere?
Some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell 20 minutes after the shooting.
I dusted the phone, too, but it was smudged.
So we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.
So much for the amateur-hour theory.
Good pull.
You are?
Freamon.
Lester Freamon.
- Where you working?
- Pawnshop Unit.
How you gonna shoot a police?
Ain't no percentage in that, know what I'm saying?
For real.
Someone around here do that, every knocko in the world be down here busting heads.
I guess them Park Heights niggers just ain't got no fucking common sense.
- A lotta heart, just no sense.
- Poot.
Wallace on the phone.
- Yeah?
- Wallace?
Nigger ring me up twice a day whether he got shit to say or not.
- Homesick motherfucker making me bug.
- Where's he at?
At the shore with his grandma.
Surfing or some bullshit.
Or something.
- You just use that phone?
- Yeah, a little earlier.
- You might wanna go to Mosher Street.
- Just now?
Yeah.
- A man downtown needs to talk to you.
- Man downtown?
Make some sense for this man, please.
- I ain't never been so clean in my life.
- I'm just doing my job.
- What up, Mr Beachfront Property?
- No, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.
- My grandmother on the bayside.
- You on vacation and not bringing me.
- How you get all the way down there?
- I took a bus.
Shit, tell me how to go, and I grab a 'hound, too.
Come down and hang with your ass.
No, man, it ain't like that.
The air down here all sticky.
Worse than Baltimore.
And these crickets, louder than a motherfucker.
I can't get no sleep.
I ain't cut out to be no country-ass nigger.
Please deposit two dollars for an additional two minutes.
Shit, I gotta go.
You can take a nigger out the Westside but you can't take...
What's your name?
Look, I didn't do shit here, OK?
- I asked you your name.
- No, this shit ain't right.
- Who'd you try to page, shit bird?
- Why the fuck do you care?
I mean...
You have exactly three more seconds to explain yourself to me, asshole.
One shooter opened the passenger door, so any latent prints from that side of the car...
- Why'd you page her, shit bird?
- Get off me.
- You think this is a game?
- I wanna talk to Greggs.
- You can't, motherfucker.
- Then McNulty then.
This shit ain't right, sir.
Savino.
Mope ain't around.
One of them low-rise hoppers on tower phone two.
OK.
Maybe he forgot the number.
- What the fuck was that?
- You don't know?
We just caught a re-up off the tower stash.
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.
Put that away.
Put that away and work the case.
Can I ask you something?
How much of this case would you give up to get her back?
- That's not the point.
- How much?
All of it.
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.
I'm sitting with a hospital progress report that shows no fucking progress.
She's not conscious, she's intubated, she's had a trach and a lung collapse.
And if she's got a shred of luck, the shot she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.
It wasn't worth it.
Homicide for McNulty on line two.
Do your job.
- Yeah?
- So how you doing with it?
- I'll live.
- Yeah?
Well, listen, Jimmy.
We had a little dust-up over here.
Holley might have beat one of your girl's Cls on spec.
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?
That's him.
You might wanna roll past and squelch this shit before it gets outta hand.
Yeah.
- It ain't worth it, man.
- It ain't worth it at ten times the price.
A fucking cop, man!
How stupid is this motherfucker?
If you see a bitch in the car, change it up.
We can go to Orlando another day.
Savino was trying to signal, but he in the dark, he don't know where Bey's coming from.
- Nothing breaking our way.
- We gotta burn this cop money.
It's probably marked somehow.
The guns are in the sewer, Bey's a rock, but it's the bitch cop.
If she talks, she gonna put Little Man and Bey in there.
- What up with Little Man?
- He's scared.
He shot a cop.
- Fuck.
- But I put Bey on that.
- What about Savino?
- Savino, he gotta eat the charge.
But he knew that.
So if he keep his story tight, he gonna be all right.
We knew Orlando was a snitching motherfucker.
But this is cash.
He got us caught up.
I know, man.
That's my fault, man.
Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that if they take Orlando, they can take the cash.
I was like, you all get your payday...
How the fuck is Orlando gonna front this type of cash?
- What it say?
- I know, I fucked up.
All right, take this trash outside, fucking burn it.
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess before he jet.
He was throwing 911 messages to her pager.
I asked him why.
He braced up.
Shit got outta hand.
Does he know?
McNulty, man.
What they doing over there?
He just started beating on me.
Last night, she got shot.
- Where the fuck were you at?
- I was there.
Hey, Bunk.
We got no good latents on the passenger side door.
What about the dash?
Call the lab.
What can I do?
For one thing you can roll around the projects, see who's missing.
Who ain't around.
You OK with that?
I been keeping it kinda close, you know?
Ain't been around the projects much lately.
You know what I'm saying?
You beefing with someone down there?
No, I'm not beefing with...
Eyes open, Bubs.
For Kima.
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.
Where are we with Savino?
- Still MIA.
- Enough of this bullshit.
If he calls me, I'll tell him to turn himself in.
I'm going to do that.
- Not good enough.
- Excuse me?
We need him now.
No, thanks.
Perhaps as an officer of the court...
Ronnie is being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.
She's putting it into your twisted language.
Me?
I wouldn't wipe my ass with a Baltimore lawyer.
- No offence.
- None taken.
I'm willing to let you ratfuckers suborn perjury and blow smoke up a judge's ass and jury-tamper your balls off without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition.
Fuck me if I don't let you structure your cash into briefcase fees, either.
That's between you and the IRS.
Neither one of you is anyone's friend.
What Jimmy is trying to say is...
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want my nose closed to your shit, you have to throw me something.
Right now I need Savino Bratton in bracelets.
- I don't know where he is.
- You repped him the last four felonies.
I guess you can get word to him if you want to.
A police may die, Maury, and Savino was there.
He comes in this afternoon, and he takes the drug charge at least.
Or what?
Or we send tactical teams into his momma's house until there's no house left to worry about.
You get a letter from the State's Attorney's office, and subpoenas for all your bank accounts.
And let's see if all those cash deposits match the reported income.
I'm hearing this from him, and I understand that he's distraught.
Am I hearing this from the State's Attorney's office as well?
You are.
I'll see what I can do.
Fuck you, Jimmy!
- You didn't tell me that was coming.
- He'll bring him in.
- He will if he can, that's not the point.
- What's the point?
The point is that Maury Levy is a past officer of the Monumental Bar Association, and unless I want to spend my whole life as an ASA,
I can't spend time pissing on people who matter.
Another career in the balance.
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.
If only half of you in the State's Attorney's office didn't want to be judges, didn't want to be partners in a law firm, if you had the balls to follow through, you know what would happen?
A guy like that would be tried and convicted.
The rest of them would back up so we could push a clean case through.
But everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.
And everybody's got a fucking future.
You'll just use anyone, won't you?
I've been searching the logs for pager hits that used an 07 code, right?
It comes up now and then on D'Angelo's pager.
Stringer's, too, but less often.
Most of the time, there's nothing to place the guy.
But check it.
- And this is on Stringer's page?
- It comes back to the pay phone at Maryland General Hospital.
Let me guess.
The date of this page is the same day that Stinkum got killed.
- And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg. - That was the talk on the wire, anyway.
If you pull the ER records for that morning, you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.
07 is Wee-Bey.
It's gotta be.
Then we have Wee-Bey and Little Man at the pay phone at Park Heights 20 minutes after the ambush, throwing a page to Stringer.
We're all over town for this piece-of-shit Savino.
With ties to the Barksdale organisation?
- Yes, sir.
- What else?
The case is progressing.
We're gleaning possible shooters from the wiretap.
I asked for the controlled buy.
I put one of our people in harm's way.
So right now I want to make sure that we are doing everything.
- We are, sir, we're on it.
- Good.
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.
Any addresses we can write on, anything connected to a narcotics case.
CID, tactical, the deus.
And tomorrow, on the six o'clock news, we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.
A lot of it.
Dope on the table?
We need to let them know who we are.
We can't for one minute let them think that this will stand.
The Commissioner wants to send a message, Lieutenant.
You make sure you and your people do everything possible to see that it is heard.
- Dope on the damn table.
- Hey.
It's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?
Again, for the record, let's make clear that Mr Bratton has not been Mirandized and that what is said here is for purposes of a proffer.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
OK, then.
Here you go.
That's baking soda.
Which Mr Bratton intended to sell to Orlando Blocker.
You can keep it with our compliments.
- Where's the money?
- Mr Bratton did not receive money.
He left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.
If you recorded the transaction, the tape will confirm this.
And he wasn't around for the shooting.
He doesn't know who the shooters are.
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck that he left them in an dead-end alley and they were shot just two minutes later.
This is bullshit.
A police is down.
Mr Bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer and no intention of doing anything other than defrauding Mr Blocker of $30,000.
Ms Nathan?
No charge if he gives us the shooters.
And if he testifies, we'll find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program.
As I indicated, Mr Bratton has no idea who shot Mr Blocker or the undercover officer.
Best you can do is 286B.
- What the hell is that?
- Distribution of sham CDS.
- Three-year maximum, $5,000 fine.
- That's it?
If he took the cash, we could go to felony theft or fraud, but the tape has him leaving the money.
- Three years.
- A cop was shot, Maury.
So if we convict, he'll do every damn day of the three.
I can do the three.
Ain't no thing.
And the $5,000 fine?
Oh, shit, you still up $25,000, right?
Nicely done.
Give me two.
Damn, Orlando.
I still can't believe that shit.
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?
- He ran a club for my uncle.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
First Stink, and now him.
And I heard the cops been all in Savino's shit, too.
- He ain't been around.
- Little Man, neither.
Somebody could clean up shit around here.
True.
You can't just be going around dropping Five-0 like that.
You know how your uncle is when people get to fucking up.
He start taking that shit personal, man.
Look like a couple more niggers gonna get dropped.
- What up?
- You D?
- Yeah.
- You need to get with Stringer right away.
See?
You moving up in the world.
As long as you don't fall in with the trash they taking out.
Yeah, whatever, nigger.
I'll be right back.
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.
Ain't answering his page, neither.
See?
I'm not gonna lie.
She has swelling around the vertebrae, and some indications of partial paralysis.
That may or may not go away when the swelling goes down.
- Her family is with her.
- What the fuck is up with Homicide?
- Are we on the shooters yet?
- They're working it hard.
The departmental response is gonna be to take doors tomorrow morning.
Citywide.
Every unit is kicking in any drug-connected address they can write on.
- We're gonna do the same.
- Lieutenant, is that...?
Except... we're gonna hold back on the main stash.
The house up in northwest we tracked...
We advance this case more by sitting there.
And raids that are too much on the bull's-eye will have Barksdale changing up.
We might blow the wire altogether.
Two addresses in the low-rises are probables and another two row houses have been used for stash as recently as last week.
But this... this here is the best bet for a good rip.
Herc picked up on it yesterday.
Fourth-floor, end unit on the south side of the 221.
They're dropping the re-ups out the window to the hoppers.
- What if they change up the apartment?
- They do that every day.
- Yesterday was the fifth floor, north side.
- We'll have a man there with a cellphone.
They change up, we call the duty judge, who orally amends the warrant.
We hit everything at 11:00.
The squad that takes the high-rise needs to stage at 05:00.
We need to be inside before the building even wakes up.
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight needs to start typing his ass off right now.
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?
You going with Bey.
Hey, Bey.
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.
Going where?
What the fuck you waiting for?
Stop bullshitting me!
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.
The Deputy.
We grab a senator's bag man in the projects, he knows that.
State Police come in, he knows that, too.
- Like fucking clockwork.
- He's got a rat.
Here, in the detail.
In the beginning, when we started, Burrell had me.
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.
- But now...
- He lost you.
So now he's picked up someone else.
That's how they do.
Can we talk?
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.
- What now?
- We're on a prime location.
Barksdale's stash.
He wants us to write a paper and take the door.
- Why?
- Dope on the table.
It's a photo op to make us feel better about Greggs getting shot.
- Christ.
- You need to rip him a new one, Your Honour.
Er...
I don't know, Jimmy.
You back on the ticket, huh?
It was just the usual bullshit.
They're just dicking me around, trying to get another black face, make it four-and-one to even up for the last time.
The Governor promised two new appointments.
So now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.
That's all?
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.
It has nothing to do with your case.
I need you on this.
So, who's my daddy now?
I just do what the fuck they tell me, you know?
It ain't on me to know what the fuck they have in mind.
- Look, Bey...
- Now it come down to this crazy shit.
Turn in this alley right here.
Right there.
What the fuck you stopping for?
Go!
Inside, man.
Let's go.
This dude is crazy.
Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.
Man, get in here.
Go ahead, man.
What's wrong with you?
Check it out, D.
I need you to feed them while I'm gone.
You gonna give them different food for each tank, too, all right?
But don't worry.
I'm gonna show you what to do.
Come here.
These are my Tetras.
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey and Jezebel in here somewhere.
I don't know, she think she cute.
You take two pinches of whatever food I got next to each tank.
They set for the day.
You see, they ain't no problems.
Just beautiful as hell, D.
I'm gonna go upstairs and pack some shit.
Bey.
Where we going, man?
Philly.
You gonna take the truck back, but first I got to grab some shit, show you what to do with my tanks, right?
Philly?
We shot a narco, D.
No Savino.
No Little Man, no Wee-Bey, either.
And the Barksdale kid from the Pit.
He's out the mix, too.
You think it was them that did it?
- Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man. - Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers and miles of NCIC bullshit.
- Warrants for blood and hair, too.
- It's Bey and Little Man, shooter one and two.
Well, right now we need our girl to wake up and say so.
All right.
You did good, Bubs.
McNulty, you know... the situation is different for me.
- I mean, for me, I'm...
- Mount up.
I gotta go.
Prez will get you a ride, OK?
Move out.
Police.
Police!
Go!
Show your hands, asshole!
Down on the ground.
Move it!
Check the basement.
- Clear?
- All clear.
- Bathroom's clear.
- Check the mattress.
Check under the bed, check all the drawers, every inch of this room.
- Got anything?
- No.
Bingo.
Got it.
There she goes.
Bag it.
Let's do it.
That's fine police work, Erv.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you see on the table in front of you represents our department's answer to a culture of death and drugs.
And when an officer falls in this war, others stand ready to pick up the challenge and carry the fight to the very doorstep of those responsible.
This is only the beginning, I can assure you.
But today, a message has been sent.
And believe me, this message is being heard loud and clear by all those who seek profit and power in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.
Slow.
Bullshit on the McCullough Street phone, nothing on the towers.
- Who's on the rooftop?
- No-one.
Fuck it.
Where's the money, man?
- How much you need?
- The bus cost like $18, man.
- Your grandma ain't got it?
- She gonna try to stop me from booking.
I'm telling you, boy.
This country-ass shit got me all messed up.
You need to send me something for the bus.
I'm dying.
I feel you.
When do you want to come home?
- When the money get here.
- All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.
Ripped by subXpacio and TusSeries English
How many shells you got?
Come on, come on!
Another bag here.
Christ.
Sergeant?
Yeah?
Who are the primaries?
Cole and Norris.
Cole's here... and Norris is at the hospital.
What do you need?
Room to work.
I keep ordering people off the scene... and between Narcotics, DEA and the two districts... we keep collecting more and more bodies around here.
Nobody move!
I said, nobody fucking move!
If you haven't been assigned a specific task by a homicide detective... you need to step away from this crime scene.
Is there anybody doesn't understand a direct order?
If you have not specifically been instructed otherwise... then remove your useless interfering asses from the area.
Now!
Slow this thing down to a crawl.
Give these bastards no chance to fuck up in a meaningful way.
Okay.
Wedged all the way to the back.
She couldn't get to it.
She taped it up front... but as soon as she put any weight on these worn-ass car seats... they pulled the tape off.
Gun slid back behind the mesh as they drove, probably.
Christ.
Where was her support?
There were two follow cars several blocks distant.
She got turned around in the alleys.
She gave her 20 as the north side of Warwick.
They went there on the shots?
The Foxtrot finally found her.
Hey, you got to be moving outta here.
So, we had two units covering the north side... and a helicopter up on top.
And no one saw any vehicles in flight.
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, come on.
What the fuck happened?
You didn't have an eyeball?
On those streets, there's no way you can eyeball it.
-She threw out 20s as best she could.
-Understood, I'm just asking.
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton.
A minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.
I gave your people that at the scene.
We're hitting his last knowns.
The set-up was more than him.
The casings are different calibers, and her Glock was full up.
-How bad?
-Chest wound, no exit.
Through and through to the throat.
She wasn't stabilized.
They had the pressure pants on her.
Trying to push up the pulse.
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.
You're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?
-Warwick, I think.
-Okay.
You've got the east well-covered...
-to the west is the rail bed.
-What did Foxtrot see?
Nothing moving except our units.
Lieutenant...
I know just how you feel.
This is the toughest job a police commissioner has.
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
This is Lieutenant Daniels.
Right, of course.
This entire department stands behind Detective Greggs... in every possible way.
I just thought you should know that.
Yes, sir.
Jaybird.
We have a runner.
Yeah, we're gonna need casts of these two imprints.
Put the lab tech on it.
1 1-39.
The money's not anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.
I'm not going to be standing... giving a shit about the money when you have lost... one of your own who might....
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.
-If we can get to this Savino character--
-Hey.
Fuck your money.
Jimmy?
You hurt?
No.
It's hers.
Come on, get up.
Let's go, up with you.
Come on.
Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.
She went into the ambo that way.
Is she....
What the fuck did I do?
Come on, walk.
What's that?
What's our plan, Ray?
Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office typing warrants for Savino.
-Who's on the autopsy?
-Me, I'm at the morgue.
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma in case she sits up and talks.
We're laser printing the car, right?
'Course, Worden's on that.
You're in command for the city, right?
Major Rawls, Homicide.
Anything you need from my office... men, money, whatever, you just ask.
Right.
Cooperator, your girl's down in shock trauma.
Let's get to work.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
We got a wire up.
So?
So we got a wire up on some motherfucker that just shot a cop.
If somebody talks, and gets on the wrong phone... says the wrong thing about what happened... where the fuck do you want to be?
Church roof?
Yeah, you and me.
Sydnor takes the McCullough Street phone.
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?
Shit.
I'll do that first, then meet you at the church.
Bunk, Mike.
Wonder who that bitch was.
-Always some shit, right?
-Yeah.
-Done?
-Done.
All right.
Let's get outta here.
Yeah.
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.
1-39.
11-35.
Can I get 18-1 2 up here?
Yeah.
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit, or even comes near it... until the tech does his recovery.
Hello.
He stopped running.
Either he got tired or--
Or he got into a car.
Right.
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 11-34.
I'm in the... 3000 block of Landvale.
Backing up to the CSX bed.
I need a lab unit, and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.
A jackhammer?
Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.
Alive.
In the OR.
My people at the scene have heard this.
-It's a copy of the original.
-Okay.
We brought a machine--
-Where the fuck is--
-Sir.
Here it is, here.
Yeah, put it there.
Don't fuck with this count.
Don't fuck with this count.
That's Savino.
I'll be right back with your shit.
Where are we?
That sign said Longwood, but I could swear this is Warwick.
Hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with you all.
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley, I don't know, shit... half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
I hope you all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?
He better not be long, 'cause I don't know where the stash is... and if they dragging us all over this part of town--
What's that?
Jesus.
-Something ain't right.
-What?
This shit ain't right.
Christ.
Signal 13, signal 13.
What the fuck?
She can't reach the gun.
-What the fuck?
-Two males, black hoodies, both of them--
Shut it off.
Shut it off.
Dr. Mells, Line 6.
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.
You played a lot of fucking cards and made a lot of people... do a lot of fucking things they didn't want to do.
This is true.
We both know this is true.
Dr. Ralston, please call cardiology.
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here... and say you did a single fucking thing to get a police shot.
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?
This is not on you.
No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.
And the motherfucker saying this... he hates your guts, McNulty.
So you know if it was on you...
I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.
That's the only lesson here.
Police!
Police, let me see your hands.
-Get on the ground!
-Down on the ground!
Search warrant, get on the ground.
Police, get down.
Let's see your hands.
-He ain't here!
-Who ain't here?
-Zach, he ain't here!
-Zach?
No, honey, we're looking for Savino.
Savino?
No, he's my baby.
Yeah, your baby shot a cop.
They're kicking in the doors, looking for Savino.
-What?
What up with that, man?
-Some shit about he killed a cop.
Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.
They kicking in the doors, acting like he did it.
-Shit.
-I'm telling you, man.
They're talking about it anyway.
Ripples in the pond.
Talking ain't knowing, is it?
Skin this cat another way.
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?
Only this one after the shooting.
Who's 07?
And what phone is he asking for Stringer to call him back?
-Shit went good, but--
-Hold on.
Officer was shot around 12.:30 this morning.
The officer may have been undercover.
-All right, talk.
-Like I said, it went good... except there was this bitch curled up in the back seat.
Surprised the shit out of us.
Didn't even see her until the shit popped off.
I mean if it was up to me, I'd have let the girl walk.
She didn't look like the talking type.
But Little Man seen her, bugged out, and let a couple go.
-Savino didn't tip y'all off to her?
-Wasn't no time for that.
He get up out the car, we see him go up the block...
like we said, right?
After that, he out of sight and we bring it home like we planned, baby.
Shorty was a cop.
And she ain't dead.
Where'd you all put the guns?
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's hos.
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?
-A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
-What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?
I mean, this motherfucker bugged out one time.
He gonna bug out again, when he find out shorty's a fucking cop?
I mean, come on, man.
Savino got a story that he can keep to and he know it... but Little Man, he always been fucking weak like that.
Little Man gotta go.
You hear me?
This shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me?
We gotta fall back.
I wanna see how it go with this Savino bullshit... see how they go past that.
But if the shit don't hold... or if this motherfucking cop wake up and start talking shit... then you gotta go sky up.
Where you got your peoples at?
New York.
Jersey, Cleveland.
All right.
So, Philly.
DC.
You know what I'm saying?
No profile, no connections, no noise.
You feel me, right?
All right.
We gotta be careful.
Jesus.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's all right, you just scared me.
I work with Kima.
Kima, she....
Kima's at work.
What is she?
Dust the receiver, the coin return, and the metal top.
The can, too.
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station, please.
We can't really know for sure.
Lieutenant.
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and--
Maybe somebody from the department or the city... maybe might want to say something.
Who's here from the family?
A daughter, you say?
A daughter?
Officer Greggs has a girl?
A roommate.
The family's in Richmond, driving up first thing today... but the roommate's already here.
I'll do it myself.
No problem.
If we lose her, he can always pose for the funeral.
Still need the right door for Savino.
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama, all empty holes.
Tracers picked up a of couple hairs on one of the hoodies.
That's something.
So, either these guys are neighborhood yos... who lucked into $30,000 on a street stickup, or....
Or they're pros who set up in an alley on one side of the tracks... then slip over to the other side... where they park their ride.
What about the post?
Cause and manner of death on Mr. Blocker is homicide... to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder, chest and left arm.
Nine millimeter, six left twist, suitable for comparison.
We pulled something else from the back seat of the car, right?
Yeah, .380.
Semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.
So, we confirmed the two shooters.
Print hit.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice, enforcer in the 221 ... a definite connect to Barksdale's world.
Print hit?
Print hit from what?
Soda can.
Dropped at the pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere.
Still had a little fizz in it when I got there.
What is this pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere?
It's from which some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell... 20 minutes after the shooting.
I dusted the phone, too, but it was smudged.
So we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest... ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.
So much for the amateur-hour theory.
Good pull.
You are?
Freamon.
Lester Freamon.
Where you working?
Pawn shop unit.
I mean, how you gonna shoot a police?
Ain't no percentage in that, know what I'm saying?
For real.
Someone around here do that shit... every narco in the world be down here busting heads.
I guess them Park Heights niggers just ain't got no fucking common sense.
A lotta heart, just no sense.
Poot.
Wallace on the phone.
-Yeah?
-Wallace?
Nigger ring me up twice a day whether he got shit to say or not.
-Homesick motherfucker making me bug.
-Where's he at?
At the shore with his grandma, down there....
Surfing or some bullshit.
Or something.
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on Line 5.
You just use that phone?
Yeah, a little earlier.
-You might wanna go to Mosher Street.
-Just now, you used it?
Yeah.
-A man downtown needs to talk to you.
-Man downtown?
Make some sense for this man, please.
All right?
-I ain't never been so clean in my life.
-I'm just doing my job.
Okay.
What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?
No, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.
My grandmother on the bayside.
Still, man, you on vacation and not bringing me with you.
How you get all the way down there?
I took a bus.
Shit, tell me how to go, and I grab a 'hound, too.
Come down there and hang with your ass.
No, man, it ain't like that.
The air down here all sticky.
Worse than Baltimore.
And these crickets, louder than a motherfucker.
I can't get no sleep.
I don't think I'm cut out to be no country-ass nigger, man.
Please deposit two dollars for an additional two minutes.
Shit, I gotta go.
You can take a nigger out the Westside.
But you can't take--
What's your name?
Look, I didn't do shit here, okay?
I asked you your name.
No, this shit ain't right.
Who'd you try to page, shit bird?
Why the fuck do you care, okay?
I mean....
You have exactly three more seconds to explain yourself to me, asshole.
One shooter definitely opened the passenger door... so any latent prints from that side of the car....
-Why'd you page her, shit bird?
-Get off me.
You think this is a fucking game?
I wanna talk to Detective Greggs.
-You can't, motherfucker.
-Then McNulty then.
This shit ain't right, sir.
Savino.
Mope ain't around.
One of them low-rise hoppers... on Tower Phone 2.
Okay.
Maybe he forgot the number.
The fuck was that?
You don't know?
We just caught a re-up off the tower stash.
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.
Put that away.
Put that away and work the case.
Can I ask you something?
How much of this case would you give up to get her back?
That's not the point.
How much?
All of it.
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.
I'm sitting with a hospital progress report that shows no fucking progress.
She's not conscious, she's intubated.
She's had a trach and a lung collapse... and if she's got a shred of luck... the shot she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.
It wasn't worth it.
Homicide for McNulty on Line 2.
Do your job.
Yeah?
So how you doing with it?
I'll live.
Yeah?
Listen, Jimmy.
We had a little dust-up over here.
Holley might have beat one of your girl's Cls on spec.
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?
Yeah, that's him.
You might wanna roll past and squelch this shit... before it gets outta hand.
Yeah.
It ain't worth it, man.
It ain't worth it at 10 times the price.
A fucking cop, man.
A cop!
How stupid is this motherfucker?
If you see a bitch in the car, change it up.
We can go to Orlando another fucking day.
Savino say he was trying to signal, but he in the dark... he don't know where Bey's coming from.
Nothing breaking our way.
We gotta burn this shit.
This is cop money.
It's probably marked somehow.
The guns are in the sewer, Bey's a rock, so that's cool.
But it's the bitch cop.
If she starts talking, she gonna put Little Man and Bey in there.
What up with Little Man?
-He's scared.
He shot a cop.
-Fuck.
But I put Bey on that.
What about Savino?
Savino, he gotta eat the charge.
But he knew that.
So if he keep his story tight, he gonna be all right.
We knew Orlando was a snitching motherfucker, man.
Fuck him, but this is cash.
He got us caught up.
I know, man.
That's my fault, man.
Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that... if they take Orlando, they can take the cash, too.
I was like, all right, you all get your payday--
How the fuck is Orlando gonna front this type of cash?
What it say?
I know.
I know, I fucked up.
All right, take this trash outside, fucking burn it.
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess before he jet.
He was throwing 91 1 messages to her pager.
I asked him why.
He raised up.
Shit got outta hand.
Does he know?
McNulty, man.
What they doing over there, man?
He just started beating on me.
Last night, she got shot.
Where the fuck were you at?
-Where were you?
-I was there.
Bunk.
Holley is investigating.
We got no good latents on the passenger side door.
...and he sees her pager coming up 91 1 .
What about the dash?
You gotta help me!
Call the lab.
What can I do?
For one thing you can roll around the projects and see who's missing.
Who ain't around.
You okay with that?
Yeah, I just....
I been keeping it kinda close, you know?
Ain't been around the projects much lately.
You know what I'm saying?
You beefing with someone down there?
No, I'm not beefing with....
Eyes open, Bubbs.
For Kima.
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.
Where are we with Savino?
-Still MIA.
-Enough of this bullshit.
If he calls me for anything, I'll tell him to turn himself in.
-I'm going to do that.
-Not good enough.
Excuse me?
We need him now.
No, thanks.
Perhaps as an officer of the court...
Ronnie here is being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.
She's putting it into your twisted little language.
Me?
I wouldn't wipe my ass with a Baltimore lawyer.
No offense.
None taken.
I mean, I'm willing to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury... blow smoke up a judge's ass and jury-tamper your balls off... without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition.
Fuck me if I don't let you structure your cash into briefcase fees, either.
That's between you and the IRS.
Neither one of you is anyone's friend, right?
What Jimmy is trying to say is--
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want my nose closed to your shit... you have to throw me something when I need it.
And right now I need Savino Bratton in bracelets.
I don't know where he is.
You repped him the last four felonies.
I guess you can get word to him if you want to.
A police may die, Morrie, and Savino was there.
He comes in this afternoon... and he takes the drug charge at least.
Or what?
Or we send tactical teams into his momma's house every night... until there's no house left to worry about.
You get a target letter from the state's attorney's office... followed by subpoenas for every bank account... in your fucking name.
And let's see if all those cash deposits match the reported income.
I'm hearing this from him... and I understand that he's distraught.
I understand that.
Am I hearing this from the state's attorney's office as well?
You are.
I'll see what I can do.
Fuck you, Jimmy!
-You didn't tell me that was coming.
-He'll bring him in.
-He will if he can, that's not the point.
-What's the point?
The point is that Morrie Levy is a past officer of the Monumental Bar Association... and unless I want to spend my whole life as a fucking ASA...
I can't spend my afternoons pissing on people who matter.
Another career in the balance.
-Fuck you.
-No, fuck you.
If only half of you in the state's attorney's office... didn't want to be judges... didn't want to be partners in a downtown law firm... if you had the balls to follow through, you know what would happen?
A guy like that would be indicted, tried and convicted.
The rest of them would back up... so we could push a clean case through your courthouse.
But no, everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.
And everybody's got a fucking future.
You'll just use anyone, won't you?
I've been searching the logs for pager hits that used an 07 code, right?
It comes up now and then on D'Angelo's pager.
Stringer's, too, but less often.
Most of the time, there's nothing to place the guy... but check it.
-And this is on Stringer's page?
-It comes back to the pay phone... in the emergency room at Maryland General Hospital.
Let me guess.
The date of this page is the same day that Stinkum got killed.
And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.
That was the talk on the wire, anyway.
If you go to Maryland General and pull the ER records for that morning... you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.
07 is Wee-Bey.
It's gotta be.
And we have Wee-Bey and Little Man at the pay phone at Park Heights... 20 minutes after the ambush... throwing a page to Stringer.
We're all over town for this piece-of-shit Savino.
With ties to the Barksdale organization?
-Yes, sir.
-What else?
The case is progressing.
We're gleaning possible shooters from the wiretap.
I asked for the controlled buy.
I put one of our people in harm's way.
So right now I want to make sure that we are doing everything.
-We are, sir, we're on it.
-Good.
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.
Any addresses we can write on, anything connected to a narcotics case.
CID, tactical, the deus... and tomorrow, on the 6:00 news... we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.
A lot of it.
Dope on the table?
We need to let them know who we are.
We can't for one minute let them think that this will stand.
The Commissioner wants to send a message, Lieutenant.
You make sure you and your people... do everything possible to see that it is heard.
Dope on the damn table.
It's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?
Again, for the record, let's make clear that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized... and that what is said here is for purposes of a proffer.
-Agreed?
-Agreed.
Okay, then.
Here you go.
That's baking soda.
Which Mr. Bratton intended to sell to Orlando Blocker.
You can keep it with our compliments.
Where's the money?
Mr. Bratton did not receive money.
He left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.
If you were recording the transaction, the tape will confirm this.
And he wasn't around for the shooting either.
He doesn't know who the shooters are.
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck... that he left them in an dead-end alley and they were shot... just two minutes later.
This is bullshit.
A police is down.
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer.
And no intention of doing anything other than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.
Ms. Nathan?
No charge if he gives us the shooters.
And if he testifies... we'll find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program.
As I indicated...
Mr. Bratton has no idea who shot Mr. Blocker... or the undercover officer.
Best you can do is 286B.
What the hell is that?
Distribution of sham CDS.
Three-year maximum, $5,000 fine.
That's it?
If he took the cash, we could go to felony theft or fraud... but the tape has him leaving the money.
Three years.
A cop was shot, Morrie.
So if we convict, he'll do every damn day of the three.
I can do the three.
Ain't no thing.
And the $5,000 fine?
Shit, you still up $25,000, right?
Nicely done.
Give me two.
Damn, Orlando.
I still can't believe that shit.
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?
-He ran a club for my uncle.
-Yeah?
Yeah, first Stink, and now him.
Yeah, man, and I heard the cops been all in Savino's shit, too.
-He ain't been around.
-Little Man, neither.
Somebody could get to cleaning up shit around here.
True.
You can't just be going around, dropping 5-0 like that.
You know how your uncle is when people get to fucking up, man.
He starts taking that shit personal, man.
Look like a couple more niggers gonna get dropped.
What up?
You Dee?
Yeah.
They say you need to get with Stringer, right away.
See?
You moving up in the world.
As long as you don't fall in with the trash they taking out.
Yeah, whatever, nigger.
I'll be right back.
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.
Ain't answering his page, neither.
See?
I'm not gonna lie.
She has swelling around the vertebrae... and some indications of partial paralysis.
That may or may not go away when the swelling goes down.
Her family is with her.
What the fuck is up with Homicide?
Are we on the shooters yet?
They're working it hard.
The departmental response is gonna be to take doors tomorrow morning.
Citywide.
Every unit, every district is kicking in... any drug-connected address they can write on.
We're gonna do the same.
-Lieutenant, is that--
-Except... we're gonna hold back on the main stash.
The house up in northwest we tracked off the wire....
We advance this case more by sitting on that location.
And raids that are too much on the bulls-eye... will have Barksdale changing up.
We might blow the wire altogether.
We got two addresses in the low-rises that are probables... and another two row houses... that have been used for stash as recently as last week.
But this.... this here is the best bet for a good rip.
Herc picked up on it yesterday.
Fourth-floor... end unit on the south side of the 221 .
They're dropping the re-ups out the window... to the hoppers who run it off.
What if they change up the apartment?
They do that every day.
Yesterday was the fifth floor on the north side.
We'll have a man on the church with a cell phone.
They change up, we call the duty judge who orally amends the warrant.
We hit everything at 1 1 :00.
The squad that takes the high-rise needs to stage at 5:00.
We need to be inside before the building even wakes up.
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight needs to start typing his ass off right now.
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?
You going with Bey.
Bey.
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.
Going where?
What the fuck you waiting for?
Stop bullshitting me.
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.
The Deputy.
We grab a senator's bag man in the projects, he knows that.
State Police bring in a cooperator, he knows it, too.
Like fucking clockwork.
He's got a rat.
Here, in the detail.
In the beginning... when we started, Burrell had me.
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.
But now he lost you.
So now he's picked up someone else.
That's how they do.
Can we talk?
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.
What now?
We're on a prime location.
Barksdale's stash.
Instead of making cases, he wants us to write a paper and take the door.
-Why?
-Dope on the table.
It's a photo op to make us feel better about Kima Greggs catching a bullet or two.
Christ.
You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.
I don't know, Jimmy.
You back on the ticket, huh?
It was just the usual bullshit.
They're just dicking me around... trying to get another black face, make it four-and-one... to even up for the last time.
The Governor had to promise two new appointments.
So now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.
That's all?
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.
It has nothing to do with your case.
I need you on this.
So, who's my daddy now?
I just do what the fuck they tell me, you know?
It ain't on me to know what the fuck they have in mind.
Look, Bey.
Now it come down to this crazy shit.
Turn in this alley right here.
Right there.
What the fuck you stopping for?
Go!
Inside, man.
Let's go.
This dude is crazy.
Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.
Man, get in here.
Go ahead, man.
What's wrong with you?
Check it out, Dee.
I need you to feed them while I'm gone.
You gonna give them different food for each tank, too, all right?
But don't worry.
I'm gonna show you what to do.
Come here.
These are my Tetras.
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey and Jezebel in here somewhere.
I don't know, she think she cute.
You take two pinches of whatever food I got next to each tank.
They set for the day.
You see, they ain't no problems.
Just beautiful as hell, Dee.
I'm gonna go upstairs, and pack some shit.
Bey.
Where we going, man?
Philly.
You gonna take the truck back... but first I got to go upstairs, grab some shit, show you what to do with my tanks, right?
Philly?
We shot a narco, Dee.
No Savino.
No Little Man, no Wee-Bey, either.
And the Barksdale kid from the Pit... he's out the mix, too.
You think it was them that did it?
Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.
Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers... and miles of NCIC bullshit.
Warrants for blood and hair, too.
It's Bey and Little Man, shooter one and two.
I feel it, Bunk.
Yeah?
Right now, we need our girl to wake up... and say so.
All right.
You did good, Bubbs.
McNulty, you know... the situation is different for me.
-I mean, for me, I'm--
-Mount up.
I gotta go.
Prez will get you a ride, okay?
Move out.
Police.
Police!
Go!
Show your hands, asshole!
Down on the ground.
Move it, move it!
McNulty, Freamon, check the basement.
-Clear?
-All clear.
-Bathroom's clear.
-Check the mattress.
Check under the bed, check all the drawers, check every fucking inch of this room.
-Got anything?
-No.
Bingo.
Got it.
There she goes.
Bag it.
Let's do it.
That's fine police work, Erv.
Ladies and gentlemen... what you see on the table in front ofyou... represents our department's answer to a culture of death and drugs.
And when an officer falls in this war... others stand ready to pick up the challenge... and carry the fight to the very doorstep of those responsible.
This is only the beginning, I can assure you.
But today, a message has been sent.
And believe me, this message is being heard loud and clear... by all those who seek profit and power... in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.
Slow.
Bullshit on the McCullough Street phone, nothing on the towers.
Who's on the rooftop?
No one.
Fuck it.
Where's the money, man?
-How much you need?
-The bus cost like $18, man.
Your grandma ain't got it?
If I ask her, she gonna try to stop me from booking.
I'm telling you, boy.
This country-ass shit got me all messed up.
I'm saying, you need to send me something for the bus.
Yeah, I feel you.
-When do you want to come home?
-When the money get here.
All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.
How many bags you got?
C'mon, c'mon!
Another bag here.
Christ.
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.
Who are the primaries?
Cole and Norris.
Cole's here and Norris is at the hospital.
What do you need?
Room to work.
I keep ordering people off the scene, and between narcotics, DEA and the two districts, we keep collecting more and more bodies around here.
Nobody move!
I said, nobody fucking move!
If you have not been assigned a specific task by a homicide detective, you need to step away from this crime scene.
Is there anybody doesn't understand a direct order?
If you have not specifically been instructed otherwise, then remove your useless interfering asses from the area.
Now!
Slow this thing down to a crawl.
Give these bastards no chance to fuck up in a meaningful way.
Okay.
Aah!
Wedged all the way to the back.
She couldn't get to it.
Well, she taped it up front, but as soon as she put any weight on these worn-ass car seats, they pulled the tape off.
Gun slid back behind the mesh as they drove, probably.
Christ.
Where was her support?
There were two follow cars, they were several blocks distant.
I think she got turned around in the alleys, she gave her 20 as the north side of Warwick.
They went there on the shots?
This, uh...
Foxtrot finally found her.
So, we had two units covering the north side and a helicopter up on top.
And no one saw any vehicles in flight.
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, c'mon.

You didn't have an eyeball?
On those streets, there's no way you can eyeball it.
She was throwing out 20s as best she could.
Understood, I'm just asking.
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton.
A minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.
I gave your people all that at the scene.
And we're hitting his last knowns.
We're on that.
The set-up was more than him.
Casings are different calibers, and her Glock was full up, so...
How bad?
Chest wound, no exit.
Through-and-through to the throat.
She wasn't stabilized.
They had the pressure pants on her.
Trying to push up the pulse.
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.
Right.
So, you're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?
Um, Warwick, I think.
Okay.
You've got everything to the east well-covered and to the west is the railbed.
What did Foxtrot see?
Nothing moving except our units.
Lieutenant...
I know just how you feel.
This is the toughest job a police commissioner has.
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
Um, this is Lieutenant Daniels.
Oh, right, right, of course.
This entire department stands behind Detective Greggs in every possible way.
I just thought you should know that.
Yes, sir.
...please report to room 12.
Please report to room 12.
Jaybird.
We have a runner.
Yeah, we're gonna need casts of these two imprints.
Put the lab tech on.
11-39.
It's not that the money is anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.
I'm not going to be standing here giving a shit about the money when you people have lost... well, one of your own who might...
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.
On the other hand, if we can get to this Savino character quick--
Hey!
Fuck your money.
Jimmy?
You hurt?
No.
It's hers.
C'mon, get up.
Let's go, up with you.
C'mon.
Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.
She went into the ambo that way.
Is she, uh... what the fuck did I do?
C'mon, walk.
What's that?
What's our plan, Ray?
Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office typing the warrants for this Savino fuck.
Who's on the autopsy?
Me, I'm at the morgue.
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma in case she sits up and talks.
We're laser printing the car, right?
'Course, Worden's on that.
You're in command for the city, right?
Major Rawls, homicide.
Anything you need from my office, men, money, whatever, you just ask.
Right.
Cooperator, your girl's down shock trauma.
Let's get to work.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
- We got a wire up.
- So?
So we got a wire up on some motherfucker that just shot a cop.
If somebody talks, if somebody gets on the wrong phone and says the wrong fuckin' thing about what happened here tonight, where the fuck do you want to be?
!
Church roof?
Yeah, you and me.
Sydnor takes the McCulloh street phone.
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?
Shit.
I'll do that first, meet you at the church.
Bunk, Mike.
Wonder who that bitch was.
Always some shit, right?
Yeah.
- Yo.
- Done.
All right.
Let's get outta here.
Yeah.
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.
- 11-39.
11-35.
Can I get 18-12 up here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit, nobody even comes near it until the tech does his recovery.
Whoa.
Hello.
He stopped running.
Either he got tired or--
- Or he got into a car.
- Right.
- 11-34.
- Go ahead, 11-34.
I'm in the 3,000 block of Lanvale backing up to the CSX bed.
I need a lab unit and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.
A jackhammer?
Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.
Alive.
In the OR.
My people at the scene have heard this already.
It's a copy of the original.
Okay, we brought a machine- where the fuck is--
- Sir.
Oh, here it is, here.
Yeah, put it there.
Don't fuck with this count.
That's Savino.
I'll be right back with ya shit.
Where are we?
That sign said Longwood, but I could swear this is Warwick.
Hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with y'all.
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley, I don't know, shit, half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
I hope y'all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?
He better not be long 'cause, see,
I don't know where the stash is, and if they draggin' us all over this part of town, you know--
What's that?
Oh, Jesus.
- Somethin' ain't right.
- What?
- Shit ain't right.
- Oh, Christ.
Yousnitchin' motherfucker.
- Signal 13, signal 13.
- What the fuck?
- She can't reach the gun.
- What the fuck?
Two males, black hoodies, both of 'em, one is--
Shut it off.
Shut it off.
- Dr. Mells, line six.
- Dr. Mells, line six.
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.
You played a lot of fucking cards and you made a lot of fucking people do a lot of fucking things they didn't want to do.
This is true.
We both know this is true.
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here and say you did a single fucking thing to get a police shot.
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?
This is not on you.
No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.
And the motherfucker saying this, he hates your guts, McNulty.
So you know if it was on you,
I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.
That's the only lesson here.
Police!
Police!
Police, let me see your hands!
Get on the ground!
Down on the ground!
Search warrant, get on the ground!
Police, police, get down, get down!
- He ain't here!
- Who ain't here?
- Zach, he ain't here!
- Zach?
Naw, honey, we're lookin' for Savino.
Savino?
No, he's my baby.
Yeah, well, your baby shot a cop.
Yo, they kickin' in the doors, lookin' for a Savino.
What?
What up with that, man?
Some shit about he killed a cop.
Who,Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.
Man they kicking' in doors, they actin' like he did it.
- Shit.
- I'm tellin' you, man.
They're talkin' about it anyway.
Ripples in the pond.
Talkin' ain't knowing', is it?
Skin this cat another way.
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?
Only this one after the shooting.
Who's 0-7?
And what phone is he asking for Stringer to call him back?
- Shit went good, but there was--
- Hold on.
- ...around 12:30 - this morning.
The officer may have been undercover...
- All right, so talk.
- Like I said, it went good.
Except there was this bitch curled up in the back-seat.
- Surprised the shit out of us.
- Uh-huh.
Didn't even see her till the shit popped off.
I mean, and if it was up to me,
I'd let the girl walk.
She didn't look like the talkin' type.
But Little Man seen her, and bugged out, let a couple go.
Savino didn't tip y'all off to that bitch?
Wasn't no time for that.
He get up out the car, we see him go up the block like we said, right?
After that, he out of sight and we bring it home like we planned, baby.
Well, shorty was a cop.
And she ain't dead.
Where'd y'all put the guns?
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's ho's.
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?
A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?
I mean, this motherfucker bugged out one time.
Well, he gonna bug out again, when he find out shorty's a fuckin' cop?
I mean, c'mon, man.
Savino got a story that he can keep to and he know it, but Little Man, he always been fuckin' weak like that.
Little Man gotta go.
Yo, you hear me?
Yo, this shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me, Bey?
We gotta fall back.
I wanna see how it go with this Savino bullshit, see how they go past that.
But if the shit don't hold, or if this motherfuckin' cop wake up and start talkin' shit, then you gotta go sky up.
Where you got your peoples at?
New York...
Jersey, Cleveland.
All right, so, um, Philly, D.C.
You know what I'm sayin'?
No profile, no connections, no noise.
You feel me, right?
All right.
We gotta be careful.
Jesus.
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.
It's alright, you just scared me.
I, uh...
I work with Kima.
Uh...
Kima, she, uh...
Kima-- Kima's at work.
What?
W-w-what are you--
Dust the receiver, the coin return, and the metal top.
The can, too.
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station, please.
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station.
We can't really know for sure.
Lieutenant?
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and,
I mean, maybe somebody from the department or the city, maybe might want to say something.
Who's here from the family?
- A daughter, you say?
- A daughter?
Officer Greggs has a girl?
A roommate.
The family's in Richmond, driving up first thing today, but the roommate's already here.
I'll do it myself.
No problem.
If we lose her, he can always pose for the funeral.
Still need a right door for Savino.
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama, all empty holes.
Tracers picked up a couple hairs on one of the hoodies.
That's something.
So, either these motherfuckers are a pair of neighborhood yo's who lucked into $30,000 on a street stickup or...
Or they're pros who set up in an alley on one side of the tracks, then slip over to the other side where they park their ride.
What about the post?
Cause and manner of death on Mr. Blocker is homicide, to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder, chest and left arm.
Nine millimeter, six left twist, suitable for comparison.
We pulled something different from the back seat of the car, right?
Yeah, 380, semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.
So, we confirmed the two shooters.
Print hit.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice, enforcer in the 221, a definite connect to Barksdale's world.
- A print hit?
- Print hit from what?
Soda can.
Dropped at the pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere.
Still had a little fizz in it when I got there.
What the fuck is this pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere?
It's a phone from which some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell 20 minutes after the shooting.
I dusted the phone, too, but it was smudged.
So, we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest, ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.
So much for the amateur-hour theory.
Good pull.
You are?
Freamon, Lester Freamon.
Where you workin'?
Pawn shop unit.
I mean, how you gonna shoot a police, yo?
Ain't no percentage in that, you know what I'm sayin'?
For real.
Somebody around here do that shit, you know every knocko in the world be down here, bustin' heads.
I guess them Park Heights nigga's just ain't got no fuckin' common sense.
A lotta heart, just no sense.
Hey, yo, Poot.
Wallace on the phone, yo.
- Yeah?
- Wallace?
Nigga ring me up twice a day whether he got shit to say or not.
Homesick motherfucker makin' me bug, yo.
Yo, where's he at, yo?
At the shore with his grandma, down there...
Probably surfing' or some bullshit.
Or something.
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on line five.
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on line five.
You just use that phone?
Yeah, a little earlier, man.
Y'all might wanna go to Mosher Street.
- Just now, you used it?
- Yeah.
Man downtown needs to talk to you.
Man downtown?
Okay, make some sense for me, please, all right?
I ain't been so clean in my whole damn life.
- Look, man, I'm just doin' my job.
- Okay.
What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?
- Naw, fool, I told you,
- I'm bayside.
My grandmother on the bayside.
Still, man, you on vacation and not bringin' me with you.
How you get all the way down there, anyhow?
- I took a bus.
- Well, shit.
Tell me how to go and I grab a 'Hound, too.
Come down there and hang with your ass.
No, man, it ain't like that, yo.
The air down here all sticky.
Worse than Baltimore, yo.
And these crickets, louder than a motherfucker.
Can't get no sleep.
I don't think I'm cut out to be no country-ass nigga, man.
Please deposit $2 for an additional...
- Shit, I gotta go.
- You can take a nigga up out the Westside,
- but you can't take--
What's your name?
Look, I didn't do shit here, okay?
I asked you your name.
Naw, this shit ain't right.
Who'd you try to page, shitbird?
Why the fuck do you care, okay?
I mean... you have exactly three more seconds to explain yourself to me, asshole.
One shooter definitely opened the passenger door, so any latent prints from that side of the car.
Ididn'tdo nothing,man !
- Why'd you page her, shitbird?
!
- Get off me, man!
- Get off me!
- You think this is a fucking game?
!
I wanna talk to Detective Greggs.
- You can't, motherfucker.
- Then, McNulty then.
This shit ain't right, sir!
Savino, Savino.
Mope ain't around.
Yeah, one of them low-rise hopper's on tower phone two.
Okay.
Maybe he forgot the number.
What the fuck was that?
You don't know?
We just caught a re-up off a tower stash.
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.
Put that away.
Put that away and work the case.
Can I ask you something?
How much of this case would you give up to get her back?
That's not the point.
Well, how much?
All of it.
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.
I'm sitting here with a hospital progress report that shows no fucking progress.
She's not conscious, she's intubated.
She's had a trach and a lung collapse, and if she's got a shred of luck, the shot she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.
It wasn't worth it.
Homicide for McNulty on line two.
Do your job.
Yeah?
So how you doing with it?
I'll live.
Yeah?
Well, listen, Jimmy, we had a little dust-up over here.
Holley mighta beat one of your girl's CIs on spec.
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?
Yeah, that's him.
You might wanna roll past and squelch this shit before it gets outta hand.
Yeah.
- It ain't worth it, man.
- Naw.
It ain't worth it at 10 times the price.
A fucking cop, man.
A cop!
How stupid is this motherfucker?
!
If you see a bitch in the car, change it up.
We can go to Orlando another fuckin' day.
Savino say he was tryin' to signal, but he in the dark, he don't know where Bey's at, or where they comin' from.
Nothin' breakin' our way, man, damn.
We gotta burn this shit.
This is cop money, it's probably marked somehow.
The guns are in the sewer, Bey's a rock, so that's cool.
But it's the bitch cop.
If she wake up and start talkin', she gonna put Little Man in there, Bey in there.
- What up with Little Man?
- He's scared.
- He shot a cop.
- Fuck.
But I put Bey on that.
What about Savino?
Well, Savino, he gotta eat the charge, but he knew that.
So if he keep his story tight, he gonna be all right.
Yeah, we knew Orlando was a snitchin' motherfucker, man.
Fuck him, but this cash got us caught up.
I know, man, that's my fault, man.
Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that, yo, if they take Orlando, they can take the cash, too.
I was like, all right, y'all get your payday.
Yo, how the fuck is Orlando gonna front this type of cash?
What it say?
I know, I know.
I fucked up, I know.
A'ight, take this trash outside, fuckin' burn it.
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess before he jet.
He was throwin' 911 messages to her pager.
I asked him why, he raised up.
Shit got outta hand.
- Does he know?
- Uh-uh.
Hey, McNulty, man.
What they doin' over there, man?
It's fucked up, they beating' on me.
Last night, she got shot.
Where the fuck were you at?
- Where were you?
- I was there.
Hey, Bunk.
We got no good latents on the passenger side door.
What about the dash?
Call the lab.
So, what can I do?
Well, for one thing you can roll around the projects, see who's missing.
Who ain't around.
You okay with that?
Yeah, yeah, I just, um...
I been keepin' it kinda close, you know?
Ain't been around the projects much lately, you know what I'm sayin'?
You beefin' with someone down there?
Naw.
No, I'm not beefin' with...
Eyes open, Bubbs.
For Kima.
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.
Where are we with Savino?
Still MIA.
Enough of this bullshit.
Well, if he calls me for anything,
I'll tell him to turn himself in.
You know I'm going to do that.
- Not good enough.
- Excuse me?
We need him now.
No, thanks.
Perhaps as an officer of the court,
- you could endeavor to--
- Ronnie's being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe, so she's putting it into your twisted little language.
Me?
I wouldn't wipe my ass with a Baltimore lawyer, no offense.
None taken.
I mean, I'm willing to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury, and blow smoke up a judge's ass and jury-tamper your balls off without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition.
And fuck me if I don't let you structure your cash into briefcase fees, either.
That's between you and the IRS.
And neither one of you is anybody's friend, right?
I think what Jimmy is trying to say is--
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want me to keep my nose closed to your shit, then you're gonna have to throw me something when I need it, and right now I need Savino Bratton in bracelets.
I don't know where he is.
Well, you repped him the last four felonies.
I'm guessing you can get word to him if you want to.
A police may die, Maury, and Savino was there.
He comes in this afternoon he takes the drug charge at least.
Or what?
Or we send tactical teams into his momma's house every night, till there's no house left to worry about.
And you get a target letter from the state's attorney's office, followed by subpoenas for every fucking bank account in your fucking name and let's see if all those cash deposits match the reported income.
I'm hearing this from him, and I understand that he's distraught.
I understand that.
Am I hearing this from the state's attorney's office as well?
You are.
I'll see what I can do.
Fuck you, Jimmy!
You didn't tell me that was coming.
He'll bring him in.
He will if he can, that's not the point.
Well, what's the point?
The point is that Maury Levy is a past officer of the Monumental Bar Association, and unless I want to spend my whole life as a fucking ASA,
I can't spend my afternoons pissing on people who matter.
Another career in the balance.
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.
If only half you motherfuckers in the state's attorney's office didn't want to be judges, didn't want to be partners in some downtown law firm, if half of you had the fucking balls to follow through,
you know what would happen?
A guy like that would be indicted, tried and convicted.
And the rest of 'em would back up enough so we could push a clean case or two through your courthouse.
But no, everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.
And everybody's got a fucking future.
You'll just use anyone, won't you?
So, I've been searchin' the logs for pager hits that used an 0-7 code, right?
It comes up now and then on D'Angelo's pager.
Stringer's too, but less often.
Most of the time, there's nothing to place the guy, but check it.
And this is on Stringer's page?
It comes back to the pay phone in the emergency room at Maryland General Hospital.
Let me guess.
The date of this page is the same day that Stinkum got killed.
And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.
That was the talk on the wire, anyway.
You go to Maryland General and pull the ER records for that morning, you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.
0-7 is Wee-Bey, it's gotta be.
And we have Wee-Bey and Little Man at the pay phone at Park Heights
20 minutes after the ambush throwing a page to Stringer.
We're all over town for this piece-of-shit Savino.
With ties to the Barksdale organization?
- Yes, sir.
- What else?
Well, the case is progressing.
We're starting to glean some possible shooters from the wiretap.
You know, I asked for the controlled buy.
I put one of our people in harm's way.
So right now I want to make sure that we are doing everything.
We are, sir.
We're on it.
Good.
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.
Any addresses we can write on.
Anything connected to a narcotics case.
CID, Tactical, the deus, and tomorrow on the 6:00 news, we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.
A lot of it!
Dope on the table?
We need to let them know who we are.
We can't for one minute let them think that this will stand.
The commissioner wants to send a message, Lieutenant.
You make sure you and your people do everything possible to see that it is heard.
Dope on the damn table.
Hey, it's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?
Again, for the record, let's make clear that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized and that what is said at this juncture is for purposes of a proffer.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Okay, then.
Here you go.
That's baking soda.
Which Mr. Bratton intended to sell to Orlando Blocker.
You can keep it with our compliments.
Where's the money?
Mr. Bratton did not receive money.
He left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.
If you were recording the transaction, the tape will confirm this.
And he wasn't around for the shooting either.
In fact, he doesn't know who the shooters are.
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck that he left them in an dead-end alley and they were shot-to-shit just two minutes later.
This is bullshit!
A police is down.
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer.
And no intention of doing anything other than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.
Ms. Nathan?
No charge if he gives us the shooters.
And if he testifies, we'll find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program.
As I indicated, Mr. Bratton has no idea who shot Mr. Blocker or the undercover officer.
Best you can do is 286-B.
What the hell is that?
Distribution of sham CDS, three year maximum,
$5,000 fine.
That's it?
If he took the cash, we could go to felony theft or fraud, but the tape has him leaving the money.
Three years.
A cop was shot, Maury.
So if we convict, he'll do every damn day of the three.
I can do the three, ain't no thing.
And the $5,000 fine?
Oh, shit, you still up 25, right?
Nicely done.
Gimme two, yo.
Damn, Orlando, yo.
I still can't believe that shit.
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?
He ran a club for my uncle, yo.
Yeah?
Yeah, first Stink, and now him.
Yeah, man, and I heard the cop's been all in Savino's shit, too.
- He ain't been around.
- Little Man, neither.
Somebody could get to cleaning' up shit around here.
True.
You can't just be goin' around, droppin' five-O like that, yo.
You know how your uncle is when people get to fuckin' up, man.
He start takin' that shit personal, man.
Look like a couple more nigga's gonna get dropped.
- Yo, what up?
- You Dee?
Yeah.
They sayin' you need to get with Stringer, right away, yo.
See?
You movin' up in the world.
As long as you don't fall in with the trash they takin' out.
Yeah, whatever, nigga.
I'll be right back.
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.
Ain't answerin' his page, neither.
See?
I'm not gonna lie.
She's got swelling around the vertebrae from a through-and-through, and some indications of partial paralysis.
That might go away when the swelling goes down.
And it might not either.
Her family is with her.
What the fuck is up with homicide?
Are we on the shooters yet?
They're working it hard.
The departmental response is gonna be to take doors tomorrow morning.
Citywide.
Every unit, every district is kicking in any drug-connected address they can write on.
We're gonna do the same.
Lieutenant, is that--
Except... we're gonna hold back on the main stash, the house up in northwest we tracked off the wire.
For one thing, we advance this case more by sitting on that location.
For another, raids that are too much on the bulls-eye will have Barksdale changing up.
We might blow the wire altogether.
We got two addresses in the low-rises that are probables, and another two rowhouses off the avenue that have been used for stash as recently as last week.
But this... this here is the best bet for a good rip.
Herc picked up on it yesterday.
Fourth-floor, end unit on the south side of the 221.
They're droppin' the re-ups out the window to the hoppers who run it off.
What if they change up the apartment?
Well, they do that every day.
Yesterday was the fifth floor on the north side.
We're gonna have a man on the church watching with a cellphone.
They change up, we call the duty judge who orally amends the warrant.
We hit everything at 1100 hours.
But the squad that takes the high-rise needs to stage at 0500.
We need to be inside before the building even wakes up.
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight, he needs to start typing his ass off right now.
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?
You goin' with Bey.
Hey, yo, Bey.
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.
Goin' where?
What the fuck you waitin' for?
Stop bullshitting' me!
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.
The deputy.
We grab a senator's bag man in the projects, he knows that.
State police come in here with a cooperator, he knows that, too.
- It's like fucking clockwork.
- He's got a rat.
Here, in the detail.
In the beginning, when we started, Burrell had me.
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.
- But now...
- He lost you.
So now he's picked up someone else.
That's how they do.
Can we talk?
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.
What now?
We're on a prime location.
Barksdale's stash.
Instead of sitting on it and making cases off it, he wants us to write a paper and take the door.
- Why?
- Dope on the table.
It's a photo op to make us all feel better about Kima Greggs catching a bullet or two.
Oh, Christ.
You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.
Uh...
I don't know, Jimmy.
You back on the ticket, huh?
It was just the usual bullshit.
They're just, um, dickin' me around, trying to get another black face on the ticket, make it four-and-one to even up for the last time.
The governor had to promise two new appointments, so now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.
That's all?
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.
It has nothing to do with your case.
I need you on this.
So, who's my daddy now?
I just do what the fuck they tell me, you know?
It ain't on me to know what the fuck they have in mind.
Look, Bey.
Now it come down to this crazy shit.
Yo, turn in this alley right here.
Right there.

I need you to feed 'em while I'm gone.
You gonna give 'em different food for each tank, too, all right?
But don't worry, I'm gonna show you what to do, c'mere.

No Savino, no Little Man, no Wee-Bey either.
And the Barksdale kid from the pit he's out the mix, too.
You think it was them that did it?
- Wee-Bey, Savino,
- Little Man.
Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers and miles of NCIC bullshit.
Warrants for blood and hair, too.
It's Bey and Little Man, shooter one and shooter two.
I feel it, Bunk.
Yeah, well, right now, we need our girl to wake up and say so.
All right.
You did good, Bubbs.
McNulty, you know, um... the situation is different for me.
- I mean, for me, I'm--
- Mount up.
I gotta go.
Prez will get you a ride, okay?
Move out.
Five-O, five-O!
- Police, police!
- Go, go, go!
Show your hands, asshole!
- Down on the ground.
- Move it, move it!
McNulty, Freamon, check the basement.
- Clear?
- All clear.
- Bathroom's clear.
- Check the mattress.
Check under the bed, check all the drawers, check every fucking inch of this room.
- Got anything?
- No.
- Bingo.
- Look at this.
Got it.
There she goes.
Bag it.
Let's do it.
That's fine police work, Erv.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you see on the table in front of you, represents our department's answer to a culture of death and drugs.
And when an officer falls in this war, others stand ready to take up the challenge and carry the fight to the very doorstep of those responsible.
Now this is only the beginning, I can assure you.
But today, a message has been sent.
And believe me, this message is being heard loud and clear by all those who seek profit and power in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.
Slow.
Bullshit on the McCulloh street phone, nothing on the towers.
Who's on the rooftop?
No one.
Fuck it.
Hey,yo, where the money, man?
How much you need?
Yo, the bus cost like 18, man.
Your grandma ain't got it?
I ask her, she gonna try to stop me from booking'.
I'm tellin' you, boy, this country-ass shit got me all messed up.
I'm sayin' you need to send me something for the bus, yo.
I'm dyin' here, all broke and shit.
Yeah, I feel you.
Well, when do you want to come home?
When the fucking money get here.
All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.
How many shells you got?
Come on, come on!
Another bag here.
Christ.
Sergeant?
Yeah?
Who are the primaries?
Cole and Norris.
Cole's here... and Norris is at the hospital.
What do you need?
Room to work.
I keep ordering people off the scene... and between Narcotics, DEA and the two districts... we keep collecting more and more bodies around here.
Nobody move!
I said, nobody fucking move!
If you haven't been assigned a specific task by a homicide detective... you need to step away from this crime scene.
Is there anybody doesn't understand a direct order?
If you have not specifically been instructed otherwise... then remove your useless interfering asses from the area.
Now!
Slow this thing down to a crawl.
Give these bastards no chance to fuck up in a meaningful way.
Okay.
Wedged all the way to the back.
She couldn't get to it.
She taped it up front... but as soon as she put any weight on these worn-ass car seats... they pulled the tape off.
Gun slid back behind the mesh as they drove, probably.
Christ.
Where was her support?
There were two follow cars several blocks distant.
She got turned around in the alleys.
She gave her 20 as the north side of Warwick.
They went there on the shots?
The Foxtrot finally found her.
Hey, you got to be moving outta here.
So, we had two units covering the north side... and a helicopter up on top.
And no one saw any vehicles in flight.
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, come on.
What the fuck happened?
You didn't have an eyeball?
On those streets, there's no way you can eyeball it.
-She threw out 20s as best she could.
-Understood, I'm just asking.
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton.
A minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.
I gave your people that at the scene.
We're hitting his last knowns.
The set-up was more than him.
The casings are different calibers, and her Glock was full up.
-How bad?
-Chest wound, no exit.
Through and through to the throat.
She wasn't stabilized.
They had the pressure pants on her.
Trying to push up the pulse.
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.
You're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?
-Warwick, I think.
-Okay.
You've got the east well-covered...
-to the west is the rail bed.
-What did Foxtrot see?
Nothing moving except our units.
Lieutenant...
I know just how you feel.
This is the toughest job a police commissioner has.
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
This is Lieutenant Daniels.
Right, of course.
This entire department stands behind Detective Greggs... in every possible way.
I just thought you should know that.
Yes, sir.
Jaybird.
We have a runner.
Yeah, we're gonna need casts of these two imprints.
Put the lab tech on it.
1 1-39.
The money's not anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.
I'm not going to be standing... giving a shit about the money when you have lost... one of your own who might....
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.
-If we can get to this Savino character--
-Hey.
Fuck your money.
Jimmy?
You hurt?
No.
It's hers.
Come on, get up.
Let's go, up with you.
Come on.
Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.
She went into the ambo that way.
Is she....
What the fuck did I do?
Come on, walk.
What's that?
What's our plan, Ray?
Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office typing warrants for Savino.
-Who's on the autopsy?
-Me, I'm at the morgue.
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma in case she sits up and talks.
We're laser printing the car, right?
'Course, Worden's on that.
You're in command for the city, right?
Major Rawls, Homicide.
Anything you need from my office... men, money, whatever, you just ask.
Right.
Cooperator, your girl's down in shock trauma.
Let's get to work.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
We got a wire up.
So?
So we got a wire up on some motherfucker that just shot a cop.
If somebody talks, and gets on the wrong phone... says the wrong thing about what happened... where the fuck do you want to be?
Church roof?
Yeah, you and me.
Sydnor takes the McCullough Street phone.
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?
Shit.
I'll do that first, then meet you at the church.
Bunk, Mike.
Wonder who that bitch was.
-Always some shit, right?
-Yeah.
-Done?
-Done.
All right.
Let's get outta here.
Yeah.
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.
1-39.
11-35.
Can I get 18-1 2 up here?
Yeah.
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit, or even comes near it... until the tech does his recovery.
Hello.
He stopped running.
Either he got tired or--
Or he got into a car.
Right.
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 11-34.
I'm in the... 3000 block of Landvale.
Backing up to the CSX bed.
I need a lab unit, and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.
A jackhammer?
Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.
Alive.
In the OR.
My people at the scene have heard this.
-It's a copy of the original.
-Okay.
We brought a machine--
-Where the fuck is--
-Sir.
Here it is, here.
Yeah, put it there.
Don't fuck with this count.
Don't fuck with this count.
That's Savino.
I'll be right back with your shit.
Where are we?
That sign said Longwood, but I could swear this is Warwick.
Hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with you all.
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley, I don't know, shit... half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
I hope you all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?
He better not be long, 'cause I don't know where the stash is... and if they dragging us all over this part of town--
What's that?
Jesus.
-Something ain't right.
-What?
This shit ain't right.
Christ.
Signal 13, signal 13.
What the fuck?
She can't reach the gun.
-What the fuck?
-Two males, black hoodies, both of them--
Shut it off.
Shut it off.
Dr. Mells, Line 6.
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.
You played a lot of fucking cards and made a lot of people... do a lot of fucking things they didn't want to do.
This is true.
We both know this is true.
Dr. Ralston, please call cardiology.
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here... and say you did a single fucking thing to get a police shot.
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?
This is not on you.
No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.
And the motherfucker saying this... he hates your guts, McNulty.
So you know if it was on you...
I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.
That's the only lesson here.
Police!
Police, let me see your hands.
-Get on the ground!
-Down on the ground!
Search warrant, get on the ground.
Police, get down.
Let's see your hands.
-He ain't here!
-Who ain't here?
-Zach, he ain't here!
-Zach?
No, honey, we're looking for Savino.
Savino?
No, he's my baby.
Yeah, your baby shot a cop.
They're kicking in the doors, looking for Savino.
-What?
What up with that, man?
-Some shit about he killed a cop.
Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.
They kicking in the doors, acting like he did it.
-Shit.
-I'm telling you, man.
They're talking about it anyway.
Ripples in the pond.
Talking ain't knowing, is it?
Skin this cat another way.
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?
Only this one after the shooting.
Who's 07?
And what phone is he asking for Stringer to call him back?
-Shit went good, but--
-Hold on.
Officer was shot around 12.:30 this morning.
The officer may have been undercover.
-All right, talk.
-Like I said, it went good... except there was this bitch curled up in the back seat.
Surprised the shit out of us.
Didn't even see her until the shit popped off.
I mean if it was up to me, I'd have let the girl walk.
She didn't look like the talking type.
But Little Man seen her, bugged out, and let a couple go.
-Savino didn't tip y'all off to her?
-Wasn't no time for that.
He get up out the car, we see him go up the block...
like we said, right?
After that, he out of sight and we bring it home like we planned, baby.
Shorty was a cop.
And she ain't dead.
Where'd you all put the guns?
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's hos.
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?
-A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
-What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?
I mean, this motherfucker bugged out one time.
He gonna bug out again, when he find out shorty's a fucking cop?
I mean, come on, man.
Savino got a story that he can keep to and he know it... but Little Man, he always been fucking weak like that.
Little Man gotta go.
You hear me?
This shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me?
We gotta fall back.
I wanna see how it go with this Savino bullshit... see how they go past that.
But if the shit don't hold... or if this motherfucking cop wake up and start talking shit... then you gotta go sky up.
Where you got your peoples at?
New York.
Jersey, Cleveland.
All right.
So, Philly.
DC.
You know what I'm saying?
No profile, no connections, no noise.
You feel me, right?
All right.
We gotta be careful.
Jesus.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's all right, you just scared me.
I work with Kima.
Kima, she....
Kima's at work.
What is she?
Dust the receiver, the coin return, and the metal top.
The can, too.
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station, please.
We can't really know for sure.
Lieutenant.
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and--
Maybe somebody from the department or the city... maybe might want to say something.
Who's here from the family?
A daughter, you say?
A daughter?
Officer Greggs has a girl?
A roommate.
The family's in Richmond, driving up first thing today... but the roommate's already here.
I'll do it myself.
No problem.
If we lose her, he can always pose for the funeral.
Still need the right door for Savino.
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama, all empty holes.
Tracers picked up a of couple hairs on one of the hoodies.
That's something.
So, either these guys are neighborhood yos... who lucked into $30,000 on a street stickup, or....
Or they're pros who set up in an alley on one side of the tracks... then slip over to the other side... where they park their ride.
What about the post?
Cause and manner of death on Mr. Blocker is homicide... to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder, chest and left arm.
Nine millimeter, six left twist, suitable for comparison.
We pulled something else from the back seat of the car, right?
Yeah, .380.
Semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.
So, we confirmed the two shooters.
Print hit.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice, enforcer in the 221 ... a definite connect to Barksdale's world.
Print hit?
Print hit from what?
Soda can.
Dropped at the pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere.
Still had a little fizz in it when I got there.
What is this pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere?
It's from which some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell... 20 minutes after the shooting.
I dusted the phone, too, but it was smudged.
So we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest... ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.
So much for the amateur-hour theory.
Good pull.
You are?
Freamon.
Lester Freamon.
Where you working?
Pawn shop unit.
I mean, how you gonna shoot a police?
Ain't no percentage in that, know what I'm saying?
For real.
Someone around here do that shit... every narco in the world be down here busting heads.
I guess them Park Heights niggers just ain't got no fucking common sense.
A lotta heart, just no sense.
Poot.
Wallace on the phone.
-Yeah?
-Wallace?
Nigger ring me up twice a day whether he got shit to say or not.
-Homesick motherfucker making me bug.
-Where's he at?
At the shore with his grandma, down there....
Surfing or some bullshit.
Or something.
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on Line 5.
You just use that phone?
Yeah, a little earlier.
-You might wanna go to Mosher Street.
-Just now, you used it?
Yeah.
-A man downtown needs to talk to you.
-Man downtown?
Make some sense for this man, please.
All right?
-I ain't never been so clean in my life.
-I'm just doing my job.
Okay.
What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?
No, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.
My grandmother on the bayside.
Still, man, you on vacation and not bringing me with you.
How you get all the way down there?
I took a bus.
Shit, tell me how to go, and I grab a 'hound, too.
Come down there and hang with your ass.
No, man, it ain't like that.
The air down here all sticky.
Worse than Baltimore.
And these crickets, louder than a motherfucker.
I can't get no sleep.
I don't think I'm cut out to be no country-ass nigger, man.
Please deposit two dollars for an additional two minutes.
Shit, I gotta go.
You can take a nigger out the Westside.
But you can't take--
What's your name?
Look, I didn't do shit here, okay?
I asked you your name.
No, this shit ain't right.
Who'd you try to page, shit bird?
Why the fuck do you care, okay?
I mean....
You have exactly three more seconds to explain yourself to me, asshole.
One shooter definitely opened the passenger door... so any latent prints from that side of the car....
-Why'd you page her, shit bird?
-Get off me.
You think this is a fucking game?
I wanna talk to Detective Greggs.
-You can't, motherfucker.
-Then McNulty then.
This shit ain't right, sir.
Savino.
Mope ain't around.
One of them low-rise hoppers... on Tower Phone 2.
Okay.
Maybe he forgot the number.
The fuck was that?
You don't know?
We just caught a re-up off the tower stash.
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.
Put that away.
Put that away and work the case.
Can I ask you something?
How much of this case would you give up to get her back?
That's not the point.
How much?
All of it.
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.
I'm sitting with a hospital progress report that shows no fucking progress.
She's not conscious, she's intubated.
She's had a trach and a lung collapse... and if she's got a shred of luck... the shot she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.
It wasn't worth it.
Homicide for McNulty on Line 2.
Do your job.
Yeah?
So how you doing with it?
I'll live.
Yeah?
Listen, Jimmy.
We had a little dust-up over here.
Holley might have beat one of your girl's Cls on spec.
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?
Yeah, that's him.
You might wanna roll past and squelch this shit... before it gets outta hand.
Yeah.
It ain't worth it, man.
It ain't worth it at 10 times the price.
A fucking cop, man.
A cop!
How stupid is this motherfucker?
If you see a bitch in the car, change it up.
We can go to Orlando another fucking day.
Savino say he was trying to signal, but he in the dark... he don't know where Bey's coming from.
Nothing breaking our way.
We gotta burn this shit.
This is cop money.
It's probably marked somehow.
The guns are in the sewer, Bey's a rock, so that's cool.
But it's the bitch cop.
If she starts talking, she gonna put Little Man and Bey in there.
What up with Little Man?
-He's scared.
He shot a cop.
-Fuck.
But I put Bey on that.
What about Savino?
Savino, he gotta eat the charge.
But he knew that.
So if he keep his story tight, he gonna be all right.
We knew Orlando was a snitching motherfucker, man.
Fuck him, but this is cash.
He got us caught up.
I know, man.
That's my fault, man.
Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that... if they take Orlando, they can take the cash, too.
I was like, all right, you all get your payday--
How the fuck is Orlando gonna front this type of cash?
What it say?
I know.
I know, I fucked up.
All right, take this trash outside, fucking burn it.
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess before he jet.
He was throwing 91 1 messages to her pager.
I asked him why.
He raised up.
Shit got outta hand.
Does he know?
McNulty, man.
What they doing over there, man?
He just started beating on me.
Last night, she got shot.
Where the fuck were you at?
-Where were you?
-I was there.
Bunk.
Holley is investigating.
We got no good latents on the passenger side door.
...and he sees her pager coming up 91 1 .
What about the dash?
You gotta help me!
Call the lab.
What can I do?
For one thing you can roll around the projects and see who's missing.
Who ain't around.
You okay with that?
Yeah, I just....
I been keeping it kinda close, you know?
Ain't been around the projects much lately.
You know what I'm saying?
You beefing with someone down there?
No, I'm not beefing with....
Eyes open, Bubbs.
For Kima.
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.
Where are we with Savino?
-Still MIA.
-Enough of this bullshit.
If he calls me for anything, I'll tell him to turn himself in.
-I'm going to do that.
-Not good enough.
Excuse me?
We need him now.
No, thanks.
Perhaps as an officer of the court...
Ronnie here is being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.
She's putting it into your twisted little language.
Me?
I wouldn't wipe my ass with a Baltimore lawyer.
No offense.
None taken.
I mean, I'm willing to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury... blow smoke up a judge's ass and jury-tamper your balls off... without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition.
Fuck me if I don't let you structure your cash into briefcase fees, either.
That's between you and the IRS.
Neither one of you is anyone's friend, right?
What Jimmy is trying to say is--
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want my nose closed to your shit... you have to throw me something when I need it.
And right now I need Savino Bratton in bracelets.
I don't know where he is.
You repped him the last four felonies.
I guess you can get word to him if you want to.
A police may die, Morrie, and Savino was there.
He comes in this afternoon... and he takes the drug charge at least.
Or what?
Or we send tactical teams into his momma's house every night... until there's no house left to worry about.
You get a target letter from the state's attorney's office... followed by subpoenas for every bank account... in your fucking name.
And let's see if all those cash deposits match the reported income.
I'm hearing this from him... and I understand that he's distraught.
I understand that.
Am I hearing this from the state's attorney's office as well?
You are.
I'll see what I can do.
Fuck you, Jimmy!
-You didn't tell me that was coming.
-He'll bring him in.
-He will if he can, that's not the point.
-What's the point?
The point is that Morrie Levy is a past officer of the Monumental Bar Association... and unless I want to spend my whole life as a fucking ASA...
I can't spend my afternoons pissing on people who matter.
Another career in the balance.
-Fuck you.
-No, fuck you.
If only half of you in the state's attorney's office... didn't want to be judges... didn't want to be partners in a downtown law firm... if you had the balls to follow through, you know what would happen?
A guy like that would be indicted, tried and convicted.
The rest of them would back up... so we could push a clean case through your courthouse.
But no, everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.
And everybody's got a fucking future.
You'll just use anyone, won't you?
I've been searching the logs for pager hits that used an 07 code, right?
It comes up now and then on D'Angelo's pager.
Stringer's, too, but less often.
Most of the time, there's nothing to place the guy... but check it.
-And this is on Stringer's page?
-It comes back to the pay phone... in the emergency room at Maryland General Hospital.
Let me guess.
The date of this page is the same day that Stinkum got killed.
And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.
That was the talk on the wire, anyway.
If you go to Maryland General and pull the ER records for that morning... you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.
07 is Wee-Bey.
It's gotta be.
And we have Wee-Bey and Little Man at the pay phone at Park Heights... 20 minutes after the ambush... throwing a page to Stringer.
We're all over town for this piece-of-shit Savino.
With ties to the Barksdale organization?
-Yes, sir.
-What else?
The case is progressing.
We're gleaning possible shooters from the wiretap.
I asked for the controlled buy.
I put one of our people in harm's way.
So right now I want to make sure that we are doing everything.
-We are, sir, we're on it.
-Good.
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.
Any addresses we can write on, anything connected to a narcotics case.
CID, tactical, the deus... and tomorrow, on the 6:00 news... we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.
A lot of it.
Dope on the table?
We need to let them know who we are.
We can't for one minute let them think that this will stand.
The Commissioner wants to send a message, Lieutenant.
You make sure you and your people... do everything possible to see that it is heard.
Dope on the damn table.
It's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?
Again, for the record, let's make clear that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized... and that what is said here is for purposes of a proffer.
-Agreed?
-Agreed.
Okay, then.
Here you go.
That's baking soda.
Which Mr. Bratton intended to sell to Orlando Blocker.
You can keep it with our compliments.
Where's the money?
Mr. Bratton did not receive money.
He left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.
If you were recording the transaction, the tape will confirm this.
And he wasn't around for the shooting either.
He doesn't know who the shooters are.
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck... that he left them in an dead-end alley and they were shot... just two minutes later.
This is bullshit.
A police is down.
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer.
And no intention of doing anything other than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.
Ms. Nathan?
No charge if he gives us the shooters.
And if he testifies... we'll find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program.
As I indicated...
Mr. Bratton has no idea who shot Mr. Blocker... or the undercover officer.
Best you can do is 286B.
What the hell is that?
Distribution of sham CDS.
Three-year maximum, $5,000 fine.
That's it?
If he took the cash, we could go to felony theft or fraud... but the tape has him leaving the money.
Three years.
A cop was shot, Morrie.
So if we convict, he'll do every damn day of the three.
I can do the three.
Ain't no thing.
And the $5,000 fine?
Shit, you still up $25,000, right?
Nicely done.
Give me two.
Damn, Orlando.
I still can't believe that shit.
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?
-He ran a club for my uncle.
-Yeah?
Yeah, first Stink, and now him.
Yeah, man, and I heard the cops been all in Savino's shit, too.
-He ain't been around.
-Little Man, neither.
Somebody could get to cleaning up shit around here.
True.
You can't just be going around, dropping 5-0 like that.
You know how your uncle is when people get to fucking up, man.
He starts taking that shit personal, man.
Look like a couple more niggers gonna get dropped.
What up?
You Dee?
Yeah.
They say you need to get with Stringer, right away.
See?
You moving up in the world.
As long as you don't fall in with the trash they taking out.
Yeah, whatever, nigger.
I'll be right back.
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.
Ain't answering his page, neither.
See?
I'm not gonna lie.
She has swelling around the vertebrae... and some indications of partial paralysis.
That may or may not go away when the swelling goes down.
Her family is with her.
What the fuck is up with Homicide?
Are we on the shooters yet?
They're working it hard.
The departmental response is gonna be to take doors tomorrow morning.
Citywide.
Every unit, every district is kicking in... any drug-connected address they can write on.
We're gonna do the same.
-Lieutenant, is that--
-Except... we're gonna hold back on the main stash.
The house up in northwest we tracked off the wire....
We advance this case more by sitting on that location.
And raids that are too much on the bulls-eye... will have Barksdale changing up.
We might blow the wire altogether.
We got two addresses in the low-rises that are probables... and another two row houses... that have been used for stash as recently as last week.
But this.... this here is the best bet for a good rip.
Herc picked up on it yesterday.
Fourth-floor... end unit on the south side of the 221 .
They're dropping the re-ups out the window... to the hoppers who run it off.
What if they change up the apartment?
They do that every day.
Yesterday was the fifth floor on the north side.
We'll have a man on the church with a cell phone.
They change up, we call the duty judge who orally amends the warrant.
We hit everything at 1 1 :00.
The squad that takes the high-rise needs to stage at 5:00.
We need to be inside before the building even wakes up.
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight needs to start typing his ass off right now.
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?
You going with Bey.
Bey.
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.
Going where?
What the fuck you waiting for?
Stop bullshitting me.
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.
The Deputy.
We grab a senator's bag man in the projects, he knows that.
State Police bring in a cooperator, he knows it, too.
Like fucking clockwork.
He's got a rat.
Here, in the detail.
In the beginning... when we started, Burrell had me.
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.
But now he lost you.
So now he's picked up someone else.
That's how they do.
Can we talk?
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.
What now?
We're on a prime location.
Barksdale's stash.
Instead of making cases, he wants us to write a paper and take the door.
-Why?
-Dope on the table.
It's a photo op to make us feel better about Kima Greggs catching a bullet or two.
Christ.
You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.
I don't know, Jimmy.
You back on the ticket, huh?
It was just the usual bullshit.
They're just dicking me around... trying to get another black face, make it four-and-one... to even up for the last time.
The Governor had to promise two new appointments.
So now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.
That's all?
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.
It has nothing to do with your case.
I need you on this.
So, who's my daddy now?
I just do what the fuck they tell me, you know?
It ain't on me to know what the fuck they have in mind.
Look, Bey.
Now it come down to this crazy shit.
Turn in this alley right here.
Right there.
What the fuck you stopping for?
Go!
Inside, man.
Let's go.
This dude is crazy.
Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.
Man, get in here.
Go ahead, man.
What's wrong with you?
Check it out, Dee.
I need you to feed them while I'm gone.
You gonna give them different food for each tank, too, all right?
But don't worry.
I'm gonna show you what to do.
Come here.
These are my Tetras.
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey and Jezebel in here somewhere.
I don't know, she think she cute.
You take two pinches of whatever food I got next to each tank.
They set for the day.
You see, they ain't no problems.
Just beautiful as hell, Dee.
I'm gonna go upstairs, and pack some shit.
Bey.
Where we going, man?
Philly.
You gonna take the truck back... but first I got to go upstairs, grab some shit, show you what to do with my tanks, right?
Philly?
We shot a narco, Dee.
No Savino.
No Little Man, no Wee-Bey, either.
And the Barksdale kid from the Pit... he's out the mix, too.
You think it was them that did it?
Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.
Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers... and miles of NCIC bullshit.
Warrants for blood and hair, too.
It's Bey and Little Man, shooter one and two.
I feel it, Bunk.
Yeah?
Right now, we need our girl to wake up... and say so.
All right.
You did good, Bubbs.
McNulty, you know... the situation is different for me.
-I mean, for me, I'm--
-Mount up.
I gotta go.
Prez will get you a ride, okay?
Move out.
Police.
Police!
Go!
Show your hands, asshole!
Down on the ground.
Move it, move it!
McNulty, Freamon, check the basement.
-Clear?
-All clear.
-Bathroom's clear.
-Check the mattress.
Check under the bed, check all the drawers, check every fucking inch of this room.
-Got anything?
-No.
Bingo.
Got it.
There she goes.
Bag it.
Let's do it.
That's fine police work, Erv.
Ladies and gentlemen... what you see on the table in front ofyou... represents our department's answer to a culture of death and drugs.
And when an officer falls in this war... others stand ready to pick up the challenge... and carry the fight to the very doorstep of those responsible.
This is only the beginning, I can assure you.
But today, a message has been sent.
And believe me, this message is being heard loud and clear... by all those who seek profit and power... in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.
Slow.
Bullshit on the McCullough Street phone, nothing on the towers.
Who's on the rooftop?
No one.
Fuck it.
Where's the money, man?
-How much you need?
-The bus cost like $18, man.
Your grandma ain't got it?
If I ask her, she gonna try to stop me from booking.
I'm telling you, boy.
This country-ass shit got me all messed up.
I'm saying, you need to send me something for the bus.
Yeah, I feel you.
-When do you want to come home?
-When the money get here.
All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.
Wake up, Baltimore.
It's 6:00 a.m....
Police!
Ready?
Freeze, fbi!
-All clear.
-Check upstairs.
Turn around.
Put your hands up.
Behind your neck.
Keep them there.
No, nothing here.
All clear.
All clear.
You won't find a goddamn thing!
I can tell you that right now.
Ain't got shit on me.
Fuck!
You ain't got nothing.
I'm telling you.
Nothing!
Move, shitbird.
fbi, show me your hands!
Get down, fuck!
Get down!
Nice.
Bingo.
-From behind your clothes washer.
-That's heroin, 300 gelcaps.
And on today's Chip Franklin Show at noon...
Chip will be live at Arundel Mills Mall asking local retailers:
"What do you get for the guy who has everything?"
Now here's Steve Stewart with sports.
The Orioles continue to....
-We could take him now.
-Not enough profile.
Fucking feds.
Be advised, target 27 is on the move.
I don't get it.
Why leave Vondopoulos out on the street?
The text message that told him to clean up, it came from someone higher up.
Someone we don't know.
We leave him on the street after these raids... he'll probably make contact with whoever's above him.
Either another text message or a meet.
What's with George Glekas?
I'm afraid he's gonna duck this warrant.
-Chester Karol Sobotka?
-It's Frank Sobotka's kid.
Frank's kid kills one of our targets?
Are you shitting me?
Why?
What for?
We hit the store this morning.
Every shred of paper's gone.
Just a bloodstain on the floor.
So we go over to his house a half hour later with the warrant... and it's full up with red-eyed Greek relations looking at us like we're braindeads.
Homicide, Shea.
-This is Daniels, out at Southeast.
-Yes, sir.
Who caught the Highlandtown murder the night before last?
Jay Landsman, sir.
I'll be right over.
Go get the interviews started.
-Lieutenant?
-Hey, Lt.
What the fuck is that about?
How did we do this morning?
Eton and Sergei are in.
So is the madam.
Glekas, I'm not sure.
-The feds are waiting on Sobotka.
-What are they waiting for?
You don't wanna know.
Jesus, Larry....
Jesus, Larry....
The thing is, I think we gotta reach out to a criminal lawyer real quick.
If the union guys can't handle this mess... he's gonna have a bail hearing tomorrow.
-Do you have any details?
-I don't know nothing... except he's locked up for it.
I can't see him till 10:00.
-That's the only time?
-Visiting hours, yeah.
Look, everything's gonna be fine.
-fbi!
All of you move, now!
-What the fuck is this?
-fbi, move!
-Against the wall.
He's here.
Got another problem here, Larry.
Big man on the docks.
You don't look so big now, do you?
Ma.
Pop.
It's gone.
And the money, too.
They say you need to come in.
They said the warrant is at Southeastern police district.
They're out there now.
Showtime, Franky.
-Frank.
-Sir, any comment?
Is it just you, or is it the whole union?
What's your comment on the charges being brought against you?
Sir, do you have anything at all to say?
Any comment at all?
How will you answer the charges against you?
Let me ask you, who exactly am I working all these dead girls for?
The Homicide unit, right?
The same Homicide unit that can't put two and two together and pick up a phone...
leaving me to read it a day-and-a-half later in The Baltimore Sun.
-What did you take from the scene?
-Photos, latents, spent casings.
Fuck.
They cleaned everything else?
Even for a supremely fucked-up police department... this takes the prize.
How'd the kid play it?
He signed a full statement.
He said that there was an argument about a stolen car or two.
Think he'll open up and talk more?
He's been processed and assigned a PD.
If you want to take a run at the kid, you're gonna have to get around his lawyer.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
It's my bad.
State your name, asshole.
What's your name?
What's your name?
State your name.
Come on, you know this part.
Give us a name.
There is your name.
State your name.
No name?
-For now, we'll just call you Boris.
-Boris.
Why always "Boris"?
Racketeering.
Wire fraud.
Conspiracy to import heroin.
Conspiracy to violate federal customs statutes.
White slavery.
Today we're only charging the customs violations, Mr. Sobotka.
But eventually, a grand jury indictment will expose you to a lot more.
But eventually, a grand jury indictment will expose you to a lot more.
Name names, and come clean.
You help yourself and your union.
Help my union?
For 25 years, we've been dying slow down there.
Dry docks rusting, piers standing empty.
My friends and their kids, like we got the cancer.
No lifeline got thrown all that time.
Nothing from nobody.
And now you wanna help us?
Help me?
-What's your full name?
-Michael McArdle.
-White Mike.
-Yeah, that's right.
Listen to this, Mikey.
I wanna know it wasn't your people... dropped that body on Potee Street the other night.
I'm asking 'cause it was someone with a Greek-ass name... and fuck if he wasn't dumped in front of a house I was using.
Did he have hands?
Did he have a face?
Yes?
Then it wasn't us.
We hit your suppliers.
They cleaned up and left you holding the dirt.
-Suppliers of what?
-You discussed a drug buy on this tape.
We also have photographs tying you to your stash house... and putting you at The Greek's warehouse over on Newkirk Street for re-ups.
Do yourself a solid here, Mike.
-What's the plan?
-This is just a detention hearing, Frank.
You're not a flight risk, you have no meaningful priors.
And so far they've only hit you with one count.
The magistrate's gonna ask us some basic questions.
Barring anything unforeseen, you're out in an hour.
-I said nothing to them suits.
-All the better.
-This Eton, he's in charge of what exactly?
-The dope.
He's what, Greek?
He's a Jew.
You know, from that Jew country they got.
-And what about the guy they call Sergei?
-Sergei's straight muscle.
-Look, I need something to eat.
-Okay, what do you want?
Two hot dogs and a strawberry soda.
I'd fuck the order up.
It's gotta be strawberry?
Hook a brother up.
Big man, that ain't gonna work for Omar.
It's all right.
Been what, a year?
Boy, you don't know, I been dreaming of running into you again.
You got a focus.
I give you that.
Man be like that when he got work to do.
You know what I mean?
I think you've done enough.
Bird gone.
Wee-Bey copped out to all them murders.
He in jail now forever and a day.
Stinkum?
I mean, you closed the book on that nigger your damn self.
Avon, he out of pocket for the time being.
Leaving you.
-You looking for closure?
-Lookit, man, ain't no closure.
Not unless Brandon walk up out his grave and come up in this room right now.
See, all I know is whoever did him that way, they gets got.
Whoever did him that way, they still out there right now.
So now you gonna play like you had nothing to do with it.
No, I can't lie.
I put the motherfucking paper out on y'all.
But y'all was fucking with my stash.
Anything after that, part of the game.
Maybe.
But see, I went past that with Brandon.
That wasn't me.
That wasn't Avon, either.
Bird and them were there to see it.
But another man did all the extras:
all that cigarette shit... all that bullshit with the eyes.
See now, this man, he building a rep for himself... and he wants you bad.
The brutal shit, that's his calling card.
Little bow-tie wearing motherfucker from out of....
NYC?
Yeah, small dude.
What he go by?
Brother Mouzone.
I know you heard of him, right?
So if y'all got the mind to go after him...
I might be able to point you in that direction.
Why?
What happened to your boy was business.
But how that shit happened, you got the right to take that to heart.
I figure that'll make us even.
Now, you wanna know where this nigger is?
-We need to sit down and talk, Frank.
-I gotta see my son.
The man's right.
Let's grab a cup of coffee or something.
Not now, I need to get clean.
Sergei and them... they did Mau Mau Willis.
-Why'd they chill him?
-He was welshing on the Jew.
Okay, Sergei's a soldier.
But he and Eton report to somebody.
-Who's above those two, Mike?
-I don't know.
-You don't know?
-Never did wanna know.
God in heaven, Zig, the cops do that to you?
Ain't the cops.
Lawyers are saying the bail might be tough.
I'm trying.
You know I'm trying, right?
-What happened?
-I don't know.
I got tired.
I got tired of being the punchline to every joke.
You had problems, you could've come to me.
You could've said something.
You wouldn't have heard.
You were always too busy dredging up the canal.
Making sure the right bum got elected.
Buying another round for the house.
I always used to think you were working all them hours you spent away.
It was all work, Zig, even when it wasn't.
For you, for your mother.
I bet you didn't even tell her I was in here, did you?
Maybe you did... and she already took three Nembutals, sleeping the day away.
-Leave her out of this.
-She's out of it, don't worry.
Pop... when I seen what I did to that kid down at the store... it made me sick to my stomach.
-That ain't you, Zig.
-It ain't?
Because the same blood don't flow for us, Pop.
I mean, I wish it did, but it don't.
You're more like me than you know.
You're a Sobotka.
Fucked is what I am.
What the fuck can I say?
Best progress so far is "White Mike" McArdle.
He's standing on the edge of the cliff.
We're gonna get Pearlman in today to see what she can do to step him off.
Also, we're still hunting the Sobotka nephew.
Herc and Carver are on that.
Still, my guess is the drug players... even if they roll, give us Eton and Sergei.
The case gets thin when we get up to this...
Spiros Vondopoulos.
Boy, them Greeks and those twisted-ass names.
Lay off the Greeks.
They invented civilization.
Yeah?
Ass-fucking, too.
What exactly do we know about Vondopoulos?
We should stay on him, see who he really is.
How about it?
Throw us a few of your well-equipped surveillance teams?
In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant, I'm the only fed still in the room.
The US attorney has what he wants with the union guys... which means my field office is pretty much over this case.
Okay, we're on Vondopoulos ourselves.
I'm sorry for him... and for you.
We should've paid more attention to our own.
Like I could've stopped Ziggy from what he'd done.
Like anyone could ever control him.
I was thinking of my boy, too.
They're dropping the net on all the guys.
Ain't no secret things get lost in them cans now and again.
He'll be all right.
They tossed my house, Frank.
They don't do that when there's a couple of cases of vodka missing.
They made me sign the search warrant.
That's a receipt-like for what they found.
Heroin, Frank.
From this house.
No, that ain't right.
That can't be right.
I knew Nicky and Zig was boosting stuff.
Cameras, shit like that.
Nothing like this.
You knew?
And once Nicky got used to boosting stuff and seeing a little money... what did you think he was gonna do?
Turn straight all of a sudden and give it up?
No, Frank.
Once you gave him a taste on the house, just....
That was never....
I mean, he knew.
He knew.
Everything I did, the cans I let through... the money we got from that went to keeping what we had.
God damn it, Frank!
Don't let that excuse this.
Not this.
Uncle Frank, with the big shoulders.
"If it's broke, give it to my uncle.
"He can fix it."
Hey, Killer.
I got something for you, come here.
You got the new Harper's yet?
Now, you know stores down the way... don't have nothing past Vibe and Handguns Today.
Some titty mags, too, if you need.
All right.
I got you.
I'm gonna hook you up, though, all right?
Hey, boy.
Told you I had something for you.
There you go.
That's my good boy.
Good day for a ship.
This is the hiring hall, Frank.
Working stevedores only.
Big Roy, let me have your card.
What do you want my card for?
Not you.
Little Big Roy, let me hold your card.
I need it.
I'm gonna work the Cape St. George today.
-I'll work it for you.
-Work it for me?
I work the ship on your card.
You work a barstool down Clement Street.
End of the week, you get paid.
Hey, Phil.
I'm putting up for the Cape St. George.
I don't see no resemblance.
We're both bald, we're both Polacks.
What the fuck else you need to know?
Who's gonna work for me?
-A different look for our boy.
-Perry Ellis or something.
How would a just-rolled-out-of-bed-looking motherfucker like you... know the designer?
Okay, I'm guessing.
It's a Joseph Abboud.
He puts dark buttons instead of brass on his blazers.
That's the Abboud signature.
You know what they call a guy who pays that much attention to his clothes, right?
A grown-up.
We're up.
-12-14, let's go.
-Copy, 1 1-34.
-That's a first.
-Sweat from a checker.
-You all right?
-Ready.
Maybe you ought to set up an easel on the sidewalk...
-and do a sketch instead.
-I'm fine.
-Anything I ought to know?
-Yeah.
Use the city.
Windows, mirrors, reflections, anything like that.
Stay on my frequency, hear?
Vondopoulos should be coming out of the garage on foot...
-right about now.
-Copy that.
Beadie Russell.
She wasn't much when we started, you know.
But now she's got game.
Thank you.
1 2-14.
I got him going into a fifth floor room.
Note the number then get down to the lobby.
-Wait on him there.
-Copy.
She's got Vondopoulos in a room.
It could be a while.
Copy.
-All this shit's going out to chassis?
-That's what they tell me.
We need a forklift.
We're almost done here.
12-14.
Vondopoulos and another man, middle-aged, blue suit...
leaving the front door of the hotel.
They'rejust behind me.
Copy?
Copy.
1 1-34.
Subject and companion, blue suit, leaving the hotel any moment now.
Copy, we got the eyeball.
The man with Vondopoulos has got to be big.
-I mean, look at that expensive suit.
-Yeah, with them buttons and all.
We leave the Benz here?
It's hot.
They didn't come back to the Benz.
You got them down there?
Negative.
-You about done?
-These nine here still got to be stripped.
-Harder than it looks.
-What ain't?
-You hear how Moonshot got his name?
-Yeah, and I could give a fuck.
Who was the room registered to?
Stephen Rados.
He gave a Northwest D.C. address.
Maybe that's the man with the good tailor.
Maybe not.
We should run out the paper trail on this guy, see what we turn up.
As to our only tangible piece of progress from the raids... what can we do for our friend White Mike?
He rolls on his suppliers, and he can walk with a long probation.
-And we can move him, if he needs.
-Witness protection?
Why have the feds with you if they're not gonna step up every now and then?
Wait a second.
You're gonna give a drug dealer a ride like that?
What about Frank Sobotka?
The feds took a shot at him and got nothing.
Or so they tell me.
The way I read it, they cared more about busting up the union--
Than anything else in the case.
If we came at Frank straight?
You can't make him any kind of specific offer yourself.
Only I can do that, and only after I get an okay from my front office.
-She could plant the seed.
-There's no better messenger, Counselor.
Take a shot.
-You going to his house?
-The Union Hall.
That's his house.
Thanks for waiting, Brucie.
Sorry I'm late.
I shouldn't even be seen with you at this point.
I just wanna settle our business while we still can.
It ain't like I'm gonna get my hands on more cash, obviously.
The grain pier is dead.
Half the votes we had lined up are walking sideways now.
They read the paper, Frank.
So what?
So I'm dirty.
The grain pier's still the grain pier, right?
They ain't voting for me, Brucie!
It ain't about me!
I'm not gonna lie.
No one is gonna stand with us now that the FBI is on you.
-They're scared.
-Of what?
They took the money, Frank.
And now if they deliver the votes, they figure the feds will be on them, too.
I'm sorry, Frank.
You find a way of putting this FBI thing to bed... maybe we can come back the next session with the grain pier.
You'll have a couple of people down there knowing they owe you a vote or two.
I don't know what else to say.
I don't.
I'm sorry, Frank.
You know what the trouble is, Brucie?
We used to make shit in this country.
Build shit.
Now we just put our hand in the next guy's pocket.
Come on, you can't eat only olives.
Order something.
Lamb or something.
I'm not hungry.
All this trouble.
-So, our associates, they are strong?
-Yes.
I don't worry about our people.
We can try to get them out before the trial.
If not, they will stand for us.
We have shown them too much.
There will be no more trouble.
We must make certain of this.
-Maybe there's another way.
-There is only one sure way.
Hear me out.
If I could guarantee that Frank Sobotka and his nephew... would be silent... wouldn't you prefer that?
But you cannot guarantee this.
Frank's son, the idiot who shot George in his store... he is going to jail for a long time... unless....
There was a young clerk wounded that day in the store.
The prosecutors want to use him as a witness.
I know his family.
Frank Sobotka will have his son back.
If a man can have this, why would he talk to the police?
What about Frank's nephew?
He is the idiot's cousin.
He wants the same thing as Frank.
Anyway, I don't worry about Niko.
You are fond of him, Spiros.
You should've had a son.
But then I would've had a wife.
If this maggot doesn't post by midnight, I'm gonna take it personal.
The shitbird lives in his parents' basement.
Where's a guy like that gonna run?
You wanna go with Auntie Tasha?
Come on.
Nice and easy, honey.
-Come here.
-All right, come on, baby.
What's up, big man?
Where the party at?
Ain't no party up in here, girl.
We thought Darnell and everybody was gonna get their smoke on.
Don't you know Darnell?
What's this good boy's name?
Hey, boy.
How you doing today?
You been good?
This a good boy.
-There it is.
-Car will be running.
What is it, Lamar?
No need to prolong this.
No, we got time.
-You kill my man?
-No, he's resting.
-I'm saying, ain't you wanna know?
-Not particularly.
About a year ago, a boy name Brandon got got here in Baltimore.
Stuck and burned before he passed.
-The game is the game.
-Indeed.
See, that boy was beautiful.
Wasn't no need for y'all to do him the way y'all did.
You feel me?
-A year, you say?
-About that.
You've got some wrong information.
Man, you lying to live.
I'm at peace with my God.
Do what you will.
So you know?
What happened to your boy, it's not my style.
The way you bleeding out your back, looks like that bullet bore clean through.
9 mm at close range will do that.
Emergency.
Do you need police or ambulance?
I wanna report a shooting over here at the new motel.
-On North Avenue.
Room 221 .
-Sir?
My pal, Beatrice.
What, you gonna run me in again?
lsn't that like double jeopardy or some shit?
Stop it, just stop it.
-Talk to me.
-And say what?
I'm sitting here trying to figure it out myself.
It didn't happen overnight.
I knew I was wrong.
But in my head, I thought I was wrong for the right reasons, you know?
There are different kinds of wrong.
What're you doing here, Bea?
I'd like you to come in.
Not in cuffs.
Because you want to.
I'm opening a door here, Frank.
I can't promise you anything.
Just come in.
We'll start from there.
You're better than them you got in bed with.
-Our man Vondopoulos didn't come home?
-Maybe he got lucky.
Maybe we didn't.
You think he ditched the Benz because he picked up the tail?
Nicky from the docks.
If you hadn't called last night, I'd have never found you.
Relax, Niko, come on.
It's like I told you on the phone.
It is going to be all right.
We can make it all right.
I should have never gone down the road with you people.
Come on.
You tried to make something of yourself.
There's no harm in that.
And you still have friends.
I'm busted.
So is my uncle and the whole fucking union.
And Ziggy?
-Christ!
-We will be a friend to him, too.
Nothing your people can do about that.
Ziggy's done.
Nothing is done, Niko.
Nothing.
Take a look.
That's not your name.
Many names, many passports.
We can do many things.
What can you do for Ziggy?
We ask only loyalty.
Why do they need sticks?
Can't they kick it with their feet?
She asked me straight-up to come in, so I'm here.
First, we need to know what you're looking for.
We don't want any misunderstandings later on.
I'm just looking for, you know, some help with my son.
-He can't jail where they got him.
-We move him to a county facility.
-What about my nephew?
-He gets arrested and charged.
But for his cooperation and yours... we can live with straight probation.
But what we can and cannot do for you and your family...
-depends on the level of your cooperation.
-You mean, how much I give you?
I got dirt on all of them.
I'll put myself in, too.
Whatever you need.
Anything but the union.
I ain't putting in no union men.
I'll give you them dead girls in the can.
I'll give you The Greek, all them sons of bitches... just to have it off my chest.
Just look to my son and my nephew.
Mr. Sobotka, at this point I have to advise you... you need to retain the services of an attorney.
We're not gonna do this now?
You need to have a lawyer present in the room.
You have that, we can make this happen first thing tomorrow.
Mr. Sobotka, I gotta ask.
Why did you stop using your cell phone?
You guys flagged it.
You think I didn't know?
Under the bridge?
It's out in the open.
I guess the cops can't bug it or nothing.
These guys, they got a big operation to protect.
They're global-like.
-They're really something?
-You got no idea.
I think I got a pretty clear picture of what they're about.
We ain't talking about a bunch of thieves rolling drums of olive oil off the docks.
Heroin?
How the fuck did that happen, Nick?
Look at me!
You ain't much more than a kid.
Me, I should've known better.
I put you up with them, for what?
I flushed my fucking family, for what?
You know what that is, Nicky?
Do you?
A condominium.
I ain't going down there.
What I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna go in and talk with the police.
That's right.
I'm gonna do to those cocksuckers what they did to me.
-You can't do that.
-Why not?
They wanna meet with us on Ziggy.
They can lean on that witness... that kid that he shot, the one that was there in the store.
The kid's gonna say that Double G had the gun.
That it was like self-defense or some shit.
Ziggy could walk, Uncle Frank.
He could.
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.
Motherfuckers!
I'll hear them out.
-All right, I'll drive.
-No, it's just me.
You ain't dealing with those guys no more.
-Uncle Frank, me and Spiros--
-I don't fucking want you with me, Nick!
Go home!
Your way... it won't work.
How many shells you got?
Come on, come on!
Another bag here.
Christ.
Sergeant?
Yeah?
Who are the primaries?
Cole and Norris.
Cole's here... and Norris is at the hospital.
What do you need?
Room to work.
I keep ordering people off the scene... and between Narcotics, DEA and the two districts... we keep collecting more and more bodies around here.
Nobody move!
I said, nobody fucking move!
If you haven't been assigned a specific task by a homicide detective... you need to step away from this crime scene.
Is there anybody doesn't understand a direct order?
If you have not specifically been instructed otherwise... then remove your useless interfering asses from the area.
Now!
Slow this thing down to a crawl.
Give these bastards no chance to fuck up in a meaningful way.
Okay.
Wedged all the way to the back.
She couldn't get to it.
She taped it up front... but as soon as she put any weight on these worn-ass car seats... they pulled the tape off.
Gun slid back behind the mesh as they drove, probably.
Christ.
Where was her support?
There were two follow cars several blocks distant.
She got turned around in the alleys.
She gave her 20 as the north side of Warwick.
They went there on the shots?
The Foxtrot finally found her.
Hey, you got to be moving outta here.
So, we had two units covering the north side... and a helicopter up on top.
And no one saw any vehicles in flight.
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, come on.
What the fuck happened?
You didn't have an eyeball?
On those streets, there's no way you can eyeball it.
- She threw out 20s as best she could.
- Understood, I'm just asking.
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton.
A minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.
I gave your people that at the scene.
We're hitting his last knowns.
The set-up was more than him.
The casings are different calibers, and her Glock was full up.
- How bad?
- Chest wound, no exit.
Through and through to the throat.
She wasn't stabilized.
They had the pressure pants on her.
Trying to push up the pulse.
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.
You're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?
- Warwick, I think.
- Okay.
You've got the east well-covered...
- to the west is the rail bed.
- What did Foxtrot see?
Nothing moving except our units.
Lieutenant...
I know just how you feel.
This is the toughest job a police commissioner has.
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
This is Lieutenant Daniels.
Right, of course.
This entire department stands behind Detective Greggs... in every possible way.
I just thought you should know that.
Yes, sir.
Jaybird.
We have a runner.
Yeah, we're gonna need casts of these two imprints.
Put the lab tech on it.
11-39.
The money's not anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.
I'm not going to be standing... giving a shit about the money when you have lost... one of your own who might...
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.
- If we can get to this Savino character-
- Hey.
Fuck your money.
Jimmy?
You hurt?
No.
It's hers.
Come on, get up.
Let's go, up with you.
Come on.
Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.
She went into the ambo that way.
Is she...
What the fuck did I do?
Come on, walk.
What's that?
What's our plan, Ray?
Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office typing warrants for Savino.
- Who's on the autopsy?
- Me, I'm at the morgue.
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma in case she sits up and talks.
We're laser printing the car, right?
'Course, Worden's on that.
You're in command for the city, right?
Major Rawls, Homicide.
Anything you need from my office... men, money, whatever, you just ask.
Right.
Cooperator, your girl's down in shock trauma.
Let's get to work.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
We got a wire up.
So?
So we got a wire up on some motherfucker that just shot a cop.
If somebody talks, and gets on the wrong phone... says the wrong thing about what happened... where the fuck do you want to be?
Church roof?
Yeah, you and me.
Sydnor takes the McCullough Street phone.
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?
Shit.
I'll do that first, then meet you at the church.
Bunk, Mike.
Wonder who that bitch was.
- Always some shit, right?
- Yeah.
- Done?
- Done.
All right.
Let's get outta here.
Yeah.
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.
1-39.
11-35.
Can I get 18-12 up here?
Yeah.
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit, or even comes near it... until the tech does his recovery.
Hello.
He stopped running.
Either he got tired or-
Or he got into a car.
Right.
-11-34.
- Go ahead, 11-34.
I'm in the... 3000 block of Landvale.
Backing up to the CSX bed.
I need a lab unit, and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.
A jackhammer?
Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.
Alive.
In the OR.
My people at the scene have heard this.
- It's a copy of the original.
- Okay.
We brought a machine-
- Where the fuck is-
- Sir.
Here it is, here.
Yeah, put it there.
Don't fuck with this count.
That's Savino.
I'll be right back with your shit.
Where are we?
That sign said Longwood, but I could swear this is Warwick.
Hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with you all.
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley, I don't know, shit... half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
I hope you all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?
He better not be long, 'cause I don't know where the stash is... and if they dragging us all over this part of town-
What's that?
Jesus.
- Something ain't right.
- What?
This shit ain't right.
Christ.
Signal 13, signal 13.
What the fuck?
She can't reach the gun.
- What the fuck?
- Two males, black hoodies, both of them-
Shut it off.
Shut it off.
Dr. Mells, Line 6.
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.
You played a lot of fucking cards and made a lot of people... do a lot of fucking things they didn't want to do.
This is true.
We both know this is true.
Dr. Ralston, please call cardiology.
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here... and say you did a single fucking thing to get a police shot.
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?
This is not on you.
No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.
And the motherfucker saying this... he hates your guts, McNulty.
So you know if it was on you...
I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.
That's the only lesson here.
Police!
Police, let me see your hands.
- Get on the ground!
- Down on the ground!
Search warrant, get on the ground.
Police, get down.
Let's see your hands.
- He ain't here!
- Who ain't here?
- Zach, he ain't here!
- Zach?
No, honey, we're looking for Savino.
Savino?
No, he's my baby.
Yeah, your baby shot a cop.
They're kicking in the doors, looking for Savino.
- What?
What up with that, man?
- Some shit about he killed a cop.
Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.
They kicking in the doors, acting like he did it.
- Shit.
- I'm telling you, man.
They're talking about it anyway.
Ripples in the pond.
Talking ain't knowing, is it?
Skin this cat another way.
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?
Only this one after the shooting.
Who's 07?
And what phone is he asking for Stringer to call him back?
- Shit went good, but-
- Hold on.
Officer was shot around 12.:30 this morning.
The officer may have been undercover.
- All right, talk.
- Like I said, it went good... except there was this bitch curled up in the back seat.
Surprised the shit out of us.
Didn't even see her until the shit popped off.
I mean if it was up to me, I'd have let the girl walk.
She didn't look like the talking type.
But Little Man seen her, bugged out, and let a couple go.
- Savino didn't tip y'all off to her?
- Wasn't no time for that.
He get up out the car, we see him go up the block...
like we said, right?
After that, he out of sight and we bring it home like we planned, baby.
Shorty was a cop.
And she ain't dead.
Where'd you all put the guns?
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's hos.
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?
- A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
- What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?
I mean, this motherfucker bugged out one time.
He gonna bug out again, when he find out shorty's a fucking cop?
I mean, come on, man.
Savino got a story that he can keep to and he know it... but Little Man, he always been fucking weak like that.
Little Man gotta go.
You hear me?
This shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me?
We gotta fall back.
I wanna see how it go with this Savino bullshit... see how they go past that.
But if the shit don't hold... or if this motherfucking cop wake up and start talking shit... then you gotta go sky up.
Where you got your peoples at?
New York.
Jersey, Cleveland.
All right.
So, Philly.
DC.
You know what I'm saying?
No profile, no connections, no noise.
You feel me, right?
All right.
We gotta be careful.
Jesus.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's all right, you just scared me.
I work with Kima.
Kima, she...
Kima's at work.
What is she?
Dust the receiver, the coin return, and the metal top.
The can, too.
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station, please.
We can't really know for sure.
Lieutenant.
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and-
Maybe somebody from the department or the city... maybe might want to say something.
Who's here from the family?
A daughter, you say?
A daughter?
Officer Greggs has a girl?
A roommate.
The family's in Richmond, driving up first thing today... but the roommate's already here.
I'll do it myself.
No problem.
If we lose her, he can always pose for the funeral.
Still need the right door for Savino.
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama, all empty holes.
Tracers picked up a of couple hairs on one of the hoodies.
That's something.
So, either these guys are neighborhood yos... who lucked into $30,000 on a street stickup, or...
Or they're pros who set up in an alley on one side of the tracks... then slip over to the other side... where they park their ride.
What about the post?
Cause and manner of death on Mr. Blocker is homicide... to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder, chest and left arm.
Nine millimeter, six left twist, suitable for comparison.
We pulled something else from the back seat of the car, right?
Yeah,.380.
Semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.
So, we confirmed the two shooters.
Print hit.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice, enforcer in the 221... a definite connect to Barksdale's world.
Print hit?
Print hit from what?
Soda can.
Dropped at the pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere.
Still had a little fizz in it when I got there.
What is this pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere?
It's from which some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell... 20 minutes after the shooting.
I dusted the phone, too, but it was smudged.
So we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest... ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.
So much for the amateur-hour theory.
Good pull.
You are?
Freamon.
Lester Freamon.
Where you working?
Pawn shop unit.
I mean, how you gonna shoot a police?
Ain't no percentage in that, know what I'm saying?
For real.
Someone around here do that shit... every narco in the world be down here busting heads.
I guess them Park Heights niggers just ain't got no fucking common sense.
A lotta heart, just no sense.
Poot.
Wallace on the phone.
- Yeah?
- Wallace?
Nigger ring me up twice a day whether he got shit to say or not.
- Homesick motherfucker making me bug.
- Where's he at?
At the shore with his grandma, down there...
Surfing or some bullshit.
Or something.
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on Line 5.
You just use that phone?
Yeah, a little earlier.
- You might wanna go to Mosher Street.
- Just now, you used it?
Yeah.
- A man downtown needs to talk to you.
- Man downtown?
Make some sense for this man, please.
All right?
- I ain't never been so clean in my life.
- I'm just doing my job.
Okay.
What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?
No, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.
My grandmother on the bayside.
Still, man, you on vacation and not bringing me with you.
How you get all the way down there?
I took a bus.
Shit, tell me how to go, and I grab a 'hound, too.
Come down there and hang with your ass.
No, man, it ain't like that.
The air down here all sticky.
Worse than Baltimore.
And these crickets, louder than a motherfucker.
I can't get no sleep.
I don't think I'm cut out to be no country-ass nigger, man.
Please deposit two dollars for an additional two minutes.
Shit, I gotta go.
You can take a nigger out the Westside.
But you can't take-
What's your name?
Look, I didn't do shit here, okay?
I asked you your name.
No, this shit ain't right.
Who'd you try to page, shit bird?
Why the fuck do you care, okay?
I mean...
You have exactly three more seconds to explain yourself to me, asshole.
One shooter definitely opened the passenger door... so any latent prints from that side of the car...
- Why'd you page her, shit bird?
- Get off me.
You think this is a fucking game?
I wanna talk to Detective Greggs.
You can't, motherfucker.
Then McNulty then.
This shit ain't right, sir.
Savino.
Mope ain't around.
One of them low-rise hoppers... on Tower Phone 2.
Okay.
Maybe he forgot the number.
The fuck was that?
You don't know?
We just caught a re-up off the tower stash.
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.
Put that away.
Put that away and work the case.
Can I ask you something?
How much of this case would you give up to get her back?
That's not the point.
How much?
All of it.
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.
I'm sitting with a hospital progress report that shows no fucking progress.
She's not conscious, she's intubated.
She's had a trach and a lung collapse... and if she's got a shred of luck... the shot she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.
It wasn't worth it.
Homicide for McNulty on Line 2.
Do your job.
Yeah?
So how you doing with it?
I'll live.
Yeah?
Listen, Jimmy.
We had a little dust-up over here.
Holley might have beat one of your girl's Cls on spec.
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?
Yeah, that's him.
You might wanna roll past and squelch this shit... before it gets outta hand.
Yeah.
It ain't worth it, man.
It ain't worth it at 10 times the price.
A fucking cop, man.
A cop!
How stupid is this motherfucker?
If you see a bitch in the car, change it up.
We can go to Orlando another fucking day.
Savino say he was trying to signal, but he in the dark... he don't know where Bey's coming from.
Nothing breaking our way.
We gotta burn this shit.
This is cop money.
It's probably marked somehow.
The guns are in the sewer, Bey's a rock, so that's cool.
But it's the bitch cop.
If she starts talking, she gonna put Little Man and Bey in there.
What up with Little Man?
- He's scared.
He shot a cop.
- Fuck.
But I put Bey on that.
What about Savino?
Savino, he gotta eat the charge.
But he knew that.
So if he keep his story tight, he gonna be all right.
We knew Orlando was a snitching motherfucker, man.
Fuck him, but this is cash.
He got us caught up.
I know, man.
That's my fault, man.
Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that... if they take Orlando, they can take the cash, too.
I was like, all right, you all get your payday-
How the fuck is Orlando gonna front this type of cash?
What it say?
I know.
I know, I fucked up.
All right, take this trash outside, fucking burn it.
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess before he jet.
He was throwing 911 messages to her pager.
I asked him why.
He raised up.
Shit got outta hand.
Does he know?
McNulty, man.
What they doing over there, man?
He just started beating on me.
Last night, she got shot.
Where the fuck were you at?
- Where were you?
- I was there.
Bunk.
Holley is investigating.
We got no good latents on the passenger side door.
...and he sees her pager coming up 911.
What about the dash?
You gotta help me!
Call the lab.
What can I do?
For one thing you can roll around the projects and see who's missing.
Who ain't around.
You okay with that?
Yeah, I just...
I been keeping it kinda close, you know?
Ain't been around the projects much lately.
You know what I'm saying?
You beefing with someone down there?
No, I'm not beefing with...
Eyes open, Bubbs.
For Kima.
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.
Where are we with Savino?
- Still MIA.
- Enough of this bullshit.
If he calls me for anything, I'll tell him to turn himself in.
- I'm going to do that.
- Not good enough.
Excuse me?
We need him now.
No, thanks.
Perhaps as an officer of the court...
Ronnie here is being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.
She's putting it into your twisted little language.
Me?
I wouldn't wipe my ass with a Baltimore lawyer.
No offense.
None taken.
I mean, I'm willing to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury... blow smoke up a judge's ass and jury-tamper your balls off... without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition.
Fuck me if I don't let you structure your cash into briefcase fees, either.
That's between you and the IRS.
Neither one of you is anyone's friend, right?
What Jimmy is trying to say is-
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want my nose closed to your shit... you have to throw me something when I need it.
And right now I need Savino Bratton in bracelets.
I don't know where he is.
You repped him the last four felonies.
I guess you can get word to him if you want to.
A police may die, Morrie, and Savino was there.
He comes in this afternoon... and he takes the drug charge at least.
Or what?
Or we send tactical teams into his momma's house every night... until there's no house left to worry about.
You get a target letter from the state's attorney's office... followed by subpoenas for every bank account... in your fucking name.
And let's see if all those cash deposits match the reported income.
I'm hearing this from him... and I understand that he's distraught.
I understand that.
Am I hearing this from the state's attorney's office as well?
You are.
I'll see what I can do.
Fuck you, Jimmy!
- You didn't tell me that was coming.
- He'll bring him in.
- He will if he can, that's not the point.
- What's the point?
The point is that Morrie Levy is a past officer of the Monumental Bar Association... and unless I want to spend my whole life as a fucking ASA...
I can't spend my afternoons pissing on people who matter.
Another career in the balance.
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.
If only half of you in the state's attorney's office... didn't want to be judges... didn't want to be partners in a downtown law firm... if you had the balls to follow through, you know what would happen?
A guy like that would be indicted, tried and convicted.
The rest of them would back up... so we could push a clean case through your courthouse.
But no, everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.
And everybody's got a fucking future.
You'll just use anyone, won't you?
I've been searching the logs for pager hits that used an 07 code, right?
It comes up now and then on D'Angelo's pager.
Stringer's, too, but less often.
Most of the time, there's nothing to place the guy... but check it.
- And this is on Stringer's page?
- It comes back to the pay phone... in the emergency room at Maryland General Hospital.
Let me guess.
The date of this page is the same day that Stinkum got killed.
And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.
That was the talk on the wire, anyway.
If you go to Maryland General and pull the ER records for that morning... you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.
07 is Wee-Bey.
It's gotta be.
And we have Wee-Bey and Little Man at the pay phone at Park Heights... 20 minutes after the ambush... throwing a page to Stringer.
We're all over town for this piece-of-shit Savino.
With ties to the Barksdale organization?
- Yes, sir.
- What else?
The case is progressing.
We're gleaning possible shooters from the wiretap.
I asked for the controlled buy.
I put one of our people in harm's way.
So right now I want to make sure that we are doing everything.
- We are, sir, we're on it.
- Good.
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.
Any addresses we can write on, anything connected to a narcotics case.
CID, tactical, the deus... and tomorrow, on the 6:00 news... we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.
A lot of it.
Dope on the table?
We need to let them know who we are.
We can't for one minute let them think that this will stand.
The Commissioner wants to send a message, Lieutenant.
You make sure you and your people... do everything possible to see that it is heard.
Dope on the damn table.
It's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?
Again, for the record, let's make clear that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized... and that what is said here is for purposes of a proffer.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Okay, then.
Here you go.
That's baking soda.
Which Mr. Bratton intended to sell to Orlando Blocker.
You can keep it with our compliments.
Where's the money?
Mr. Bratton did not receive money.
He left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.
If you were recording the transaction, the tape will confirm this.
And he wasn't around for the shooting either.
He doesn't know who the shooters are.
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck... that he left them in an dead-end alley and they were shot... just two minutes later.
This is bullshit.
A police is down.
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer.
And no intention of doing anything other than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.
Ms. Nathan?
No charge if he gives us the shooters.
And if he testifies... we'll find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program.
As I indicated...
Mr. Bratton has no idea who shot Mr. Blocker... or the undercover officer.
Best you can do is 286B.
What the hell is that?
Distribution of sham CDS.
Three-year maximum, $5,000 fine.
That's it?
If he took the cash, we could go to felony theft or fraud... but the tape has him leaving the money.
Three years.
A cop was shot, Morrie.
So if we convict, he'll do every damn day of the three.
I can do the three.
Ain't no thing.
And the $5,000 fine?
Shit, you still up $25,000, right?
Nicely done.
Give me two.
Damn, Orlando.
I still can't believe that shit.
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?
- He ran a club for my uncle.
- Yeah?
Yeah, first Stink, and now him.
Yeah, man, and I heard the cops been all in Savino's shit, too.
- He ain't been around.
- Little Man, neither.
Somebody could get to cleaning up shit around here.
True.
You can't just be going around, dropping 5-0 like that.
You know how your uncle is when people get to fucking up, man.
He starts taking that shit personal, man.
Look like a couple more niggers gonna get dropped.
What up?
You Dee?
Yeah.
They say you need to get with Stringer, right away.
See?
You moving up in the world.
As long as you don't fall in with the trash they taking out.
Yeah, whatever, nigger.
I'll be right back.
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.
Ain't answering his page, neither.
See?
I'm not gonna lie.
She has swelling around the vertebrae... and some indications of partial paralysis.
That may or may not go away when the swelling goes down.
Her family is with her.
What the fuck is up with Homicide?
Are we on the shooters yet?
They're working it hard.
The departmental response is gonna be to take doors tomorrow morning.
Citywide.
Every unit, every district is kicking in... any drug-connected address they can write on.
We're gonna do the same.
- Lieutenant, is that-
- Except... we're gonna hold back on the main stash.
The house up in northwest we tracked off the wire...
We advance this case more by sitting on that location.
And raids that are too much on the bulls-eye... will have Barksdale changing up.
We might blow the wire altogether.
We got two addresses in the low-rises that are probables... and another two row houses... that have been used for stash as recently as last week.
But this... this here is the best bet for a good rip.
Herc picked up on it yesterday.
Fourth-floor... end unit on the south side of the 221.
They're dropping the re-ups out the window... to the hoppers who run it off.
What if they change up the apartment?
They do that every day.
Yesterday was the fifth floor on the north side.
We'll have a man on the church with a cell phone.
They change up, we call the duty judge who orally amends the warrant.
We hit everything at 11:00.
The squad that takes the high-rise needs to stage at 5:00.
We need to be inside before the building even wakes up.
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight needs to start typing his ass off right now.
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?
You going with Bey.
Bey.
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.
Going where?
What the fuck you waiting for?
Stop bullshitting me.
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.
The Deputy.
We grab a senator's bag man in the projects, he knows that.
State Police bring in a cooperator, he knows it, too.
Like fucking clockwork.
He's got a rat.
Here, in the detail.
In the beginning... when we started, Burrell had me.
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.
But now he lost you.
So now he's picked up someone else.
That's how they do.
Can we talk?
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.
What now?
We're on a prime location.
Barksdale's stash.
Instead of making cases, he wants us to write a paper and take the door.
- Why?
- Dope on the table.
It's a photo op to make us feel better about Kima Greggs catching a bullet or two.
Christ.
You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.
I don't know, Jimmy.
You back on the ticket, huh?
It was just the usual bullshit.
They're just dicking me around... trying to get another black face, make it four-and-one... to even up for the last time.
The Governor had to promise two new appointments.
So now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.
That's all?
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.
It has nothing to do with your case.
I need you on this.
So, who's my daddy now?
I just do what the fuck they tell me, you know?
It ain't on me to know what the fuck they have in mind.
Look, Bey.
Now it come down to this crazy shit.
Turn in this alley right here.
Right there.
What the fuck you stopping for?
Go!
Inside, man.
Let's go.
This dude is crazy.
Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.
Man, get in here.
Go ahead, man.
What's wrong with you?
Check it out, Dee.
I need you to feed them while I'm gone.
You gonna give them different food for each tank, too, all right?
But don't worry.
I'm gonna show you what to do.
Come here.
These are my Tetras.
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey and Jezebel in here somewhere.
I don't know, she think she cute.
You take two pinches of whatever food I got next to each tank.
They set for the day.
You see, they ain't no problems.
Just beautiful as hell, Dee.
I'm gonna go upstairs, and pack some shit.
Bey.
Where we going, man?
Philly.
You gonna take the truck back... but first I got to go upstairs, grab some shit, show you what to do with my tanks, right?
Philly?
We shot a narco, Dee.
No Savino.
No Little Man, no Wee-Bey, either.
And the Barksdale kid from the Pit... he's out the mix, too.
You think it was them that did it?
Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.
Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers... and miles of NCIC bullshit.
Warrants for blood and hair, too.
It's Bey and Little Man, shooter one and two.
I feel it, Bunk.
Yeah?
Right now, we need our girl to wake up... and say so.
All right.
You did good, Bubbs.
McNulty, you know... the situation is different for me.
- I mean, for me, I'm-
- Mount up.
I gotta go.
Prez will get you a ride, okay?
Move out.
Police.
Police!
Go!
Show your hands, asshole!
Down on the ground.
Move it, move it!
McNulty, Freamon, check the basement.
- Clear?
- All clear.
- Bathroom's clear.
- Check the mattress.
Check under the bed, check all the drawers, check every fucking inch of this room.
- Got anything?
- No.
Bingo.
Got it.
There she goes.
Bag it.
Let's do it.
That's fine police work, Erv.
Ladies and gentlemen... what you see on the table in front ofyou... represents our department's answer to a culture of death and drugs.
And when an officer falls in this war... others stand ready to pick up the challenge... and carry the fight to the very doorstep of those responsible.
This is only the beginning, I can assure you.
But today, a message has been sent.
And believe me, this message is being heard loud and clear... by all those who seek profit and power... in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.
Slow.
Bullshit on the McCullough Street phone, nothing on the towers.
Who's on the rooftop?
No one.
Fuck it.
Where's the money, man?
- How much you need?
- The bus cost like $18, man.
Your grandma ain't got it?
If I ask her, she gonna try to stop me from booking.
I'm telling you, boy.
This country-ass shit got me all messed up.
I'm saying, you need to send me something for the bus.
Yeah, I feel you.
- When do you want to come home?
- When the money get here.
All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.
Mr Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
Nicola!
This, this...
- Not this.
- Nicola...?
How was your massage?
You're in breach.
Cigarette.
Is this about the new pages?
I made the changes... all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh...?
- You've insulted me for the last time.
- You're right.
It's actually...
it's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee?
!
Wait a minute- The tyres are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is so sad.
See, it's lower already.
- Nicola, please, don't do this to me.
- I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture out of loyalty.
Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
Look, I already put out a press release citing 'creative differences,'
- so just let it go.
- You went to the press?
- Do we have everything?
- Alright.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
You ought to go.
I don't deserve you.
Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
'Creative differences'?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a Teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analysed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
According to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other 'name' is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing...
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
- I told you she was bad.
- No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
- 'Mike 'n' Ike's'?
- They're not just any 'Mike 'n' Ike's,' these are cherry 'Mike 'n' Ike's.'
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award- nominated director...
That was 'Short Subject.'
- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with- look, look... pockets full of these things?
- I have a feeling you'll tell me.
- I'm going to tell you.
Because Ms Nicola Anders... supermodel with a SAG card- has it written in her contract that all cherry 'Mike 'n' Ike's' be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her... three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
We're at their mercy.
What happened?
We always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones that would tell them what to do.
We would tell them what to wear,
- who to date-
- That's what you want?
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names at will.
- Yeah- more than once.
- Viktor, do you realise you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
- Shine a light in that darkened cinema.
- It's called a projector.
llluminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
- Okay.
- I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York... it's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old times' sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mum canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Okay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mum.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr Taransky?
Mr Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant wouldn't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call Security.
I'll call Security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr Taransky... the answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading lady right here... in my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from-
- It's me!
Mr Taransky, don't... don't you recognise me?
The 'Future of Film' Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech...
- 'Who Needs Humans?
'
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
I remember.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
In that whole time I never left my computer.
- Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
- Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this- the eye tumour...
- microwaves from the screen.
- Oh dear, I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
- You have to see her.
- Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Well, you're talking about a 'syn-thespian,' a 'virtual actor.'
- No, we call them 'Vac-tors.' - 'Vac-tors'?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why- you're so perfect, Mr Taransky.
You have something...
that I don't have.
What's that?
An eye- an eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- 'Straw God'... that changed my life.
You saw 'Straw God'?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realise my vision.
You and me, art and science... we're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But I tell you what, I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumour is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumour is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead, Hank.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
You don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door, for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr Taransky.
Mr Taransky!
- Mr Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
'Why are we here?
'
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No 'why'... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're supposed to believe that was 19th-century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys... who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too cartoony or anything?
- Who, the nun?
- Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh- 'not of this earth.'
- And the rest of the film?
- She's a miracle, Dad.
Where did you find her?
Well, I saw her picture on the computer.
Computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about it?
Only your brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mum will take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what...
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film 'Sunrise, Sunset.'
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
'Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelly... and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.'
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out, just like you said.
Very good.
- Mr Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitised.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep... and a little more...
Bacall.
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'?
How do I look?
- Give me Audrey.
- How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr Taransky?
I'm going to tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't I?
Of course...
with Hank's tragic passing, his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see... see beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped... naturally in favour of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's 'real' anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
That's a grey area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
'To whom it may concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews,
- or making publicity appearances-
- This is unbelievable...
I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone.'
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
Where did you find her?
- Is 'Simone' her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms Simone begins production on her new film today...
'Eternity Forever.' This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding 'Hank'?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
- And now?
- Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
- We gave you complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
They're cleaning the engine now.
- Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry- nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't
- Look, I have not read 'Eternity Forever,' but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of 'Clive.'
- 'Clyde.' - 'Clyde,' right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
- I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought
I would be perfect for 'Clyde' as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Do you think he'd be right for 'Eternity Forever'?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
We'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
- Anything you can do.
Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey...
- Is this some kind of jamming device?
- this is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work...
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is...
it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
We'll talk at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know it's not some middle-aged freak?
I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
Are you holding her hostage?
You're the hostage.
You look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss 'Eternity Forever.'
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself... you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and makeup?
- Does her own.
- In her theatre training.
- Oh, she was in the theatre?
- Where?
- I'll send you her resume.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
We've gotta do something about this- stuntwoman.
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
She doesn't need one.
Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
Oh.
We'll shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but as Elaine, ex-wife- hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously- you got lucky this last time, but you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but as Viktor, your first former husband, what happened to you?
Hmm?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
Are they...
- They're all here.
- Okay, thank you.
- Hello.
- Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for 'Eternity Forever.'
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlett.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologising for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work,
I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say, except that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde,
- is that love-
- Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
Alright.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone...
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr Taransky.
Why do you have to bring that up?
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms Enomis.
- Ah, Ms Enomis.
Now, Ms Enomis demands her privacy, so you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone will escort Ms Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
- Who is it?
- It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're alright now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith, thank God for you.
I mean, this is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
Well... you know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
like her?
Oh, yes, of course, like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone.
What?
What did you say?
I said, do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me 'Simone'!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
- Is something wrong?
- Well, actually... maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the presidential suite.
Ahem...
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir, I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture... the picture- it's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
Is she here?
Hey, Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
- Somebody said she was here.
- Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
- I'm your biggest fan!
- Simone!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview... a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
- Our best people are on it, Mr Sayer.
- Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes.
Every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours...
and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once... and then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman... a 'tell-all' story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
- Mr Taransky gave me instructions-
- No!
- What are you doing?
- Mr Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for 'Eternity Forever.'
- They're in the toilet.
- She has to get out and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk-show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight
- that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
She is about the work and only the work!
This is overshadowing the work.
- If you can't handle her, I will.
- It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of 'Good for Nothing.' This is not a good time.
- It never is.
Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
We just want to have a meeting.
We can talk- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this, are we?
What is all this, Viktor?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose... it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer... addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere, why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
- Spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights- name it.
This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
- We can work with that.
- I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
- Thank you.
- Give her our best.
- That agoraphobia- it's like a plague.
- It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you... no, no- don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really, but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well...
Alright.
Good.
Thanks, Viktor.
Thank you.
I'm gonna- bye.
Tonight, on 'Frank Brand Live'... since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, 'Sunrise, Sunset,' no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone... until now.
I'm happy to say that she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
I mean, does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now is to put the attention back where it belongs... on Mr Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic, Simone.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press...
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a 'Mr Right' in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
- I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in, is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love 'Eternity Forever.'
'Eternity Forever' is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of 'Eternity Forever.'
- He's a genius.
- You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star... but there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too... if you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot of the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh... and for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in the trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I've got to tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record
- I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
Alright.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I've got to ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions
- not to take their eyes off the crowd.
- Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
Unreal.
Remember- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone- live on stage for the debut concert of the 'Splendid Isolation' Tour.
Let's get you into hair and makeup.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only
- Simone!
I love you L.A.
It's great to be here.
" Looking out on the morning rain "
" I used to feel so inspired "
" And when I knew I had to face another day "
" Lord, it made me feel so tired "
" Before the day I met you "
" Life was so unkind "
" But you're the key to my peace of mind "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" Like a natural woman "
" Oh, baby, what you've done to me "
" Done to me "
" You made me feel so good inside "
" Good inside "
" And I just wanna be "
" Wanna be "
" Close to you, you make me feel so alive "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" Like a natural woman "
" You make me feel "
- " You make me feel " - " You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel like a real... "
" You make me feel "
" Feel like a... "
" You make me feel like a real... "
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
" What you've done to me... "
" Natural woman. "
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favourite girls in all the world.
- We stopped by to congratulate Simone.
- Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good colour on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realise that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
Elaine, I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and Mum, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, but Mum doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- My God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I...
- Where are you?
- I'm right here... beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you, but I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognise the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Oh, Christ.
Elaine, I just...
Whoa!
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you alright?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
- Could you go to the Oscars with him?
- No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay, okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
Alright, I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And the winner of 'Best Actress'... is... oh my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for 'Sunrise, Sunset'...
Thank you.
...and Simone for 'Eternity Forever.'
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight, but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Ladies and gentlemen- Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the 'Best Actress' category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also want to thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr Taransky, are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologise for what happened on 'Sunrise.'
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
'Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.'
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right when you smile, it...
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes- that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in 'Eternity Forever.'
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this... clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taking advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Got to go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighbourhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's...
already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that... make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But-
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
But for some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning
- you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
- She's gonna retire.
- She'll never work again.
- Her public will demand that she does.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine-
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code moulded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There is no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being... a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me?
I made you first.
Well, we're back on 'Good Morning, Good Day,' and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel?
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean... you know, make some confession- because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career... but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie, so, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
But what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human...
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say, 'Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you.'
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop him.
Forgive me, Mr Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and Internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood... all fake?
Hmm?
This is fake?
This is fake?
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So I will confess... to fraud, but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this 'Hank Aleno' that you keep talking about, renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead.
Now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look- even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's 'Sim one'- see?
'Simulation one'!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body- of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor, I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
- ...that she bought for you.
I did- I can prove...
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood... you killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated... so I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defence.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- 'I created her.'
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah
- Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her- like in the flesh?
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, Mum, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
We don't want to believe Daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey... there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mum.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
- What's that?
- Part of Dad's story may be true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity... due to the trauma of your divorce,
10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her...
I bludgeoned her...
I set her on fire, and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news- international media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of 'The LA Times.'
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now?
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where are we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
- What do you think, Lainey?
- About you and Mum?
Well, about me and Simone... what I did- everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake...
as long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from 'The Echo.'
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... 'Why?
'
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish bowl... the insatiable appetite of the media... with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work, and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby?
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, 'Chip,' is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
" Looking out on the morning rain "
" I used to feel so inspired "
" And when I knew I had to face another day "
" Lord, it made me feel so tired "

" You're the key to my peace of mind "

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 19th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category,
let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight,
like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
Hmm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
-...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do,
living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# You're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# When my soul was in the lost and found #
# You came along to claim it #
# And didn't know what was wrong with me #
# Till your kiss helped me name it #
# Now I'm no longer doubtful #
# To what I'm living for #

# You make me feel like a natural woman #

# Oh, baby, what you've done to me #
# Done to me #

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are over inflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they 'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but They used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When the y were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- H ere we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- H e y, Dad.
- How are you, hone y?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Be cause it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
By e, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- H e y, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Pleas e, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight y ears ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
U h-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An e y e.
An e y e for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
H e wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 1 9th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingénue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
H e y, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't I?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See be yond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favour of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a grey area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine y ears ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are They involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, he y.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's bus y right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, hone y.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Hone y, I know you want to do charity work.
No, They've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would They do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- U h-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theatre training.
- Oh, she was in the theatre?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- even the fall from the plane?
- even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
H uh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are They--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when They're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, They're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, They're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and be yond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the s cent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you bus y tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', They're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
N ever stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 4 2 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- By e.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stay ed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am,
They're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that They're not about special effects.
And They are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could They have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
N ice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.

You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
H ere, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 1 00,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
Looking out
On the morning rain
I used to feel so inspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Oh, baby
What you've done to me
Done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I just wanna be
Wanna be
Close to you, you make me feel so alive
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
- You make me feel
- You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a real...
You make me feel
Feel like a...
You make me feel like a real...
Thank you.
N ever stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
What you've done to me
Natural woman.
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favourite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good colour on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Os cars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
By e.
- By e!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... I s...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky ,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
H ere.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, hone y?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighbourhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
U h... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code moulded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight,
They'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but They like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
H ere I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
" Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
H e actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
H e was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
H mm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what They were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly .
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
H e y, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
- ...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where They are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
H e y, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defence.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 1 0 y ears of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them They can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, hone y.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
H e y, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
Looking out
On the morning rain
I used to feel so inspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
And didn't know what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
To what I'm living for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
Done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I just wanna be
Wanna be
Close to you, you make me feel so alive
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a real...
You make me feel
Feel like a real...
You make me feel like a real...
She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only...
Simone!
I love you L.A.
It's great to be here.

Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
, ' What you've done to me..., '
, ' Natural woman., '
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favourite girls in all the world.
- We stopped by to congratulate Simone.
- Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good colour on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realise that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
Elaine, I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and Mum, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, but Mum doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- My God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I...
- Where are you?
- I'm right here... beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you, but I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognise the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Oh, Christ.
Elaine, I just...
Whoa!
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you alright?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
- Could you go to the Oscars with him?
- No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay, okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
Alright, I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And the winner of 'Best Actress'... is... oh my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for 'Sunrise, Sunset'...
Thank you.
...and Simone for 'Eternity Forever. '
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight, but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the 'Best Actress' category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also want to thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr Taransky, are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologise for what happened on 'Sunrise. '
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
'Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead. '
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right when you smile, it...
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in 'Eternity Forever. '
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this... clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taking advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Got to go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighbourhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's...
already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that... make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But...
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
But for some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning
- You would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
- She's gonna retire.
- She'll never work again.
- Her public will demand that she does.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine...
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code moulded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There is no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being... a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me?
I made you first.
Well, we're back on 'Good Morning, Good Day, ' and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel?
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean... you know, make some confession... because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career... but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie, so, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
But what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human...
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say, 'Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you. '
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop him.
Forgive me, Mr Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and Internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood... all fake?
Hmm?
This is fake?
This is fake?
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So I will confess... to fraud, but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this 'Hank Aleno' that you keep talking about, renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead.
Now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look...
even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's 'Sim one'... see?
'Simulation one'!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question...
altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body...
of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor, I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
...that she bought for you.
I did...
I can prove...
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood... you killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated... so I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defence.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- 'I created her. '
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah...
Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her...
like in the flesh?
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, Mum, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
We don't want to believe Daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey... there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mum.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
- What's that?
- Part of Dad's story may be true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity... due to the trauma of your divorce,
10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her...
I bludgeoned her...
I set her on fire, and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news...
international media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of 'The LA Times. '
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- But thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now?
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where are we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
- What do you think, Lainey?
- About you and Mum?
Well, about me and Simone... what I did... everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake...
as long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from 'The Echo. '
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... 'Why?
'
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish bowl... the insatiable appetite of the media... with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work, and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby?
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, 'Chip, ' is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 19th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category,
let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight,
like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
Hmm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
-...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do,
living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# You're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# When my soul was in the lost and found #
# You came along to claim it #
# And didn't know what was wrong with me #
# Till your kiss helped me name it #
# Now I'm no longer doubtful #
# To what I'm living for #

# 'Cause you make me feel #

# Oh, baby, what you've done to me #

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
Nicola!
This, this...
- Not this.
- Nicola...?
How was your massage?
You're in breach.
Cigarette.
Is this about the new pages?
I made the changes-- all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh...?
- You've insulted me for the last time.
- You're right.
It's actually...
it's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee?
!
Wait a minute-- The tyres are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is so sad.
See, it's lower already.
- Nicola, please, don't do this to me.
- I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture out of loyalty.
Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
Look, I already put out a press release citing 'creative differences,'
- so just let it go.
- You went to the press?
- Do we have everything?
- Alright.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
You ought to go.
I don't deserve you.
Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
'Creative differences'?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a Teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analysed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
According to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other 'name' is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
- I told you she was bad.
- No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
- 'Mike 'n' Ike's'?
- They're not just any 'Mike 'n' Ike's,' these are cherry 'Mike 'n' Ike's.'
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award- nominated director--
That was 'Short Subject.'
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look... pockets full of these things?
- I have a feeling you'll tell me.
- I'm going to tell you.
Because Ms Nicola Anders-- supermodel with a SAG card-- has it written in her contract that all cherry 'Mike 'n' Ike's' be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
We're at their mercy.
What happened?
We always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones that would tell them what to do.
We would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names at will.
- Yeah-- more than once.
- Viktor, do you realise you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
- Shine a light in that darkened cinema.
- It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
- Okay.
- I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York-- it's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old times' sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mum canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Okay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mum.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr Taransky?
Mr Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant wouldn't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call Security.
I'll call Security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr Taransky-- the answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading lady right here-- in my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr Taransky, don't-- don't you recognise me?
The 'Future of Film' Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech- 'Who Needs Humans?
'
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
I remember.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
In that whole time I never left my computer.
- Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
- Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this-- the eye tumour- microwaves from the screen.
- Oh dear, I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
- You have to see her.
- Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Well, you're talking about a 'syn-thespian,' a 'virtual actor.'
- No, we call them 'Vac-tors.' - 'Vac-tors'?
I need flesh.
- No, we call them 'Vac-tors.' - 'Vac-tors'?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- you're so perfect, Mr Taransky.
You have something...
that I don't have.
What's that?
An eye-- an eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- 'Straw God'-- that changed my life.
You saw 'Straw God'?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realise my vision.
You and me, art and science-- we're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But I tell you what, I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumour is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumour is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead, Hank.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
You don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door, for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr Taransky.
Mr Taransky!
- Mr Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
'Why are we here?
'
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No 'why'... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're supposed to believe that was 1 9th-century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys... who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too cartoony or anything?
- Who, the nun?
- Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh-- 'not of this earth.'
- And the rest of the film?
- She's a miracle, Dad.
Where did you find her?
Well, I saw her picture on the computer.
Computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about it?
Only your brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mum will take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film 'Sunrise, Sunset.'
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
'Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelly-- and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.'
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out, just like you said.
Very good.
- Mr Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitised.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep... and a little more...
Bacall.
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'?
How do I look?
- Give me Audrey.
- How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr Taransky?
I'm going to tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't I?
Of course...
with Hank's tragic passing, his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see-- see beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favour of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's 'real' anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
That's a grey area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
'To whom it may concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews,
- or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable--
I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone.'
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
Where did you find her?
- Is 'Simone' her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms Simone begins production on her new film today--
'Eternity Forever.' This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding 'Hank'?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
- And now?
- Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
- We gave you complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
They're cleaning the engine now.
- Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry-- nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't-
- Look, I have not read 'Eternity Forever,' but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of 'Clive.'
- 'Clyde.' - 'Clyde,' right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
- I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought
I would be perfect for 'Clyde' as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Do you think he'd be right for 'Eternity Forever'?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
We'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
- Anything you can do.
Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey...
- Is this some kind of jamming device?
- this is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work...
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is...
it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
We'll talk at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know it's not some middle-aged freak?
I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
Are you holding her hostage?
You're the hostage.
You look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss 'Eternity Forever.'
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself... you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and makeup?
- Does her own.
- In her theatre training.
- Oh, she was in the theatre?
- Where?
- I'll send you her resume.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
We've gotta do something about this-- stuntwoman.
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
She doesn't need one.
Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
Oh.
We'll shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but as Elaine, ex-wife-- hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously-- you got lucky this last time, but you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but as Viktor, your first former husband, what happened to you?
Hmm?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
Are they--
- They're all here.
- Okay, thank you.
- Hello.
- Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for 'Eternity Forever.'
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlett.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologising for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work,
I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say, except that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde,
- is that love--
- Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
Alright.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone...
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr Taransky.
Why do you have to bring that up?
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms Enomis.
- Ah, Ms Enomis.
Now, Ms Enomis demands her privacy, so you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone will escort Ms Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
- Who is it?
- It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're alright now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith, thank God for you.
I mean, this is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
Well... you know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
like her?
Oh, yes, of course, like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone.
What?
What did you say?
I said, do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me 'Simone'!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
- Is something wrong?
- Well, actually... maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the presidential suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir, I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture-- the picture-- it's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
Is she here?
Hey, Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
- Somebody said she was here.
- Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
- I'm your biggest fan!
- Simone!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview-- a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
- Our best people are on it, Mr Sayer.
- Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes.
Every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours...
and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once-- and then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman-- a 'tell-all' story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
- Mr Taransky gave me instructions--
- No!
- What are you doing?
- Mr Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for 'Eternity Forever.'
- They're in the toilet.
- She has to get out and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk-show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight
- that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
She is about the work and only the work!
This is overshadowing the work.
- If you can't handle her, I will.
- It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of 'Good for Nothing.' This is not a good time.
- It never is.
Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
We just want to have a meeting.
We can talk-- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this, are we?
What is all this, Viktor?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose... it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere, why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
- Spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights-- name it.
This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
- We can work with that.
- I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
- Thank you.
- Give her our best.
- That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
- It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you-- no, no-- don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really, but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well...
Alright.
Good.
Thanks, Viktor.
Thank you.
I'm gonna-- bye.
Tonight, on 'Frank Brand Live'-- since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, 'Sunrise, Sunset,' no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone--
until now.
I'm happy to say that she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
I mean, does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now is to put the attention back where it belongs-- on Mr Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic, Simone.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a 'Mr Right' in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
- I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in, is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love 'Eternity Forever.'
'Eternity Forever' is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of 'Eternity Forever.'
- He's a genius.
- You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star... but there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too... if you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot of the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh... and for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in the trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I've got to tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record-
- I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
Alright.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I've got to ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions
- not to take their eyes off the crowd.
- Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
Unreal.
Remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the 'Splendid Isolation' Tour.
Let's get you into hair and makeup.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 1 00,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only-
- Simone!
I love you L.A.
It's great to be here.
" Looking out on the morning rain "
" I used to feel so inspired "
" And when I knew I had to face another day "
" Lord, it made me feel so tired "
" Before the day I met you "
" Life was so unkind "
" But you're the key to my peace of mind "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" Like a natural woman "
" Oh, baby, what you've done to me "
" Done to me "
" You made me feel so good inside "
" Good inside "
" And I just wanna be "
" Wanna be "
" Close to you, you make me feel so alive "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" Like a natural woman "
" You make me feel "
- " You make me feel " - " You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel like a real... "
" You make me feel "
" Feel like a... "
" You make me feel like a real... "
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
" What you've done to me... "
" Natural woman. "
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favourite girls in all the world.
- We stopped by to congratulate Simone.
- Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good colour on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realise that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
Elaine, I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and Mum, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, but Mum doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- My God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here... beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you, but I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognise the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Oh, Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa!
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you alright?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
- Could you go to the Oscars with him?
- No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay, okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
Alright, I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And the winner of 'Best Actress'... is... oh my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for 'Sunrise, Sunset'...
Thank you.
...and Simone for 'Eternity Forever.'
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight, but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Ladies and gentlemen-- Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the 'Best Actress' category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also want to thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr Taransky, are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologise for what happened on 'Sunrise.'
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
'Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.'
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right when you smile, it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes-- that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in 'Eternity Forever.'
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this-- clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taking advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Got to go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighbourhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's...
already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that-- make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
But for some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning
- you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
- She's gonna retire.
- She'll never work again.
- Her public will demand that she does.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code moulded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There is no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me?
I made you first.
Well, we're back on 'Good Morning, Good Day,' and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel?
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean-- you know, make some confession-- because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career... but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie, so, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
But what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human--
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say, 'Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you.'
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop him.
Forgive me, Mr Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and Internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood... all fake?
Hmm?
This is fake?
This is fake?
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So I will confess... to fraud, but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this 'Hank Aleno' that you keep talking about, renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead.
Now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look-- even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's 'Sim one'-- see?
'Simulation one'!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body-- of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor, I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
- ...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood-- you killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated... so I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defence.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- 'I created her.'
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah-
- Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her-- like in the flesh?
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, Mum, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
We don't want to believe Daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey... there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mum.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
- What's that?
- Part of Dad's story may be true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity... due to the trauma of your divorce,
1 0 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her...
I bludgeoned her...
I set her on fire, and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news-- international media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of 'The LA Times.'
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now?
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where are we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
- What do you think, Lainey?
- About you and Mum?
Well, about me and Simone-- what I did-- everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake...
as long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from 'The Echo.'
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... 'Why?
'
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish bowl-- the insatiable appetite of the media-- with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work, and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby?
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, 'Chip,' is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
" Looking out on the morning rain "
" I used to feel so inspired "
" And when I knew I had to face another day "
" Lord, it made me feel so tired "

" You're the key to my peace of mind "

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me She's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- Not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually...
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are over inflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look. here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- Out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with N icola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
N icola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
N icola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the N icola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing...
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director...
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
...overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with...
look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. N icola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her... three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking...
we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- Who to date...
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
N ew York...
Cassavetes.
Remember?
- here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that... or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in N ew York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You'reviktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
By e, Dad.
- hi, sweetheart.
- hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your pray ers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from...
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't...
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who N eeds humans? "
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight y ears ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
U h-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The ey e tumor.
- Microwaves from the s creen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "s yn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "v ac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why...
that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- That I don't have.
- What's that?
An ey e.
An ey e for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and s cience...
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
they're at the door for God's sake.
hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
he wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 1 9th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on s creen?
Oh, y eah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of thisearth.
- You should bevery proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what...
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was dis covered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely priv ate.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
they're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has thevoice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly... ha-ha...
and the face... of Audrey hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- Just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the s cales have tipped... naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances...
- This is unbeliev able.
- I politely request that the press respect my priv acy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today...
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it niney ears ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
they were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- they're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against N icola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't...
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's bus y right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
he's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- By e, Dad.
- By e, honey.
hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
hey, you want to come in?
- hi.
- hi, Honey.
- hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to dis cuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's s cript notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- U h-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so dis ciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this...
- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- even the fall from the plane?
- even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying thevery people who dis covered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they...
- they're all here.
Okay, thank you.
hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love s cenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
H i, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm hewlitt.
We can rehearse in priv ate if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, ob viously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doub t, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love...
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own ey es.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her priv acy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will es cort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your dis cretion.
U nderstood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the s cent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, y es, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call meviktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- Or something.
- Are you bus y tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem...
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture...
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- She doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Say er.
Get better people!
What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky?
they're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Ob viously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
N ever stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
they're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- And only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 4 2 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- Girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer... addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights...
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia...
it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you...
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you werevery beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna...
By e.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live...
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone... until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic s chedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stay ed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just be cause I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much s creen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on s creen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press...
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not dis cuss my priv ate life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
N udity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodby e.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel sincey esterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." he's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
N ice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in N ew Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she hasever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've ob tained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
U nless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember... no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone...
live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it'seasier to make 1 00,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the ke y to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She'sexhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking adv antage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking aboutviktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don'texist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
The y have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
Thees calating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is thiselaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I...
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- hi!
- hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh,elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I reognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just...
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Os cars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's myexit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern tehnology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don'teven feel I belong in the Best Actress category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
N icola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saweach other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right...
when you smile it...
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, hone y?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's noteven grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my s cript next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leavingearly.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
hi.
hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
U h... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back,elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But...
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a seret now,elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
-elaine...
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyalenough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematicalequation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have re created the infinite nuances of a human being... a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear,elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if the y still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think allelementary s chools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowdedenough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have youever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don'teat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, beause...
I've defrauded millions.
The y'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, beause... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, the y'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but the y like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phone y-balone y world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world youexisted.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that Iexist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorne y.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
" Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wishi had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
H mm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfetly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what the y were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone beause there was no Simone.
- Right.exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"...
See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you couldexplain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question...
altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn'texist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
H uh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
He y, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
...that she bought for you.
I did...
I can prove...
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and dis cs.
Where are the dis cs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where the y are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's dis cs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just...
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
He y, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted reognition.
I wanted to be appreiated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny herexistence?
I can never forgive that.
Beause obviously sheexisted, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it'sembarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well... we don't want to believe daddy beause we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can beured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a ps y chiatrist in Ventura, well-respeted, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 1 0 years of abjet failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them the y can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
-excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today'sedition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, hone y.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- But thank you.
- Well, it was lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we doneenough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from theeho.
- hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Goodevening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you'reeager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expeting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
hi.
Oh yes.

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
Nicola!
This, this...
- Not this.
- Nicola...?
How was your massage?
You're in breach.
Cigarette.
Is this about the new pages?
I made the changes-- all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh...?
- You've insulted me for the last time.
- You're right.
It's actually...
it's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee?
!
Wait a minute-- The tyres are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is so sad.
See, it's lower already.
- Nicola, please, don't do this to me.
- I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture out of loyalty.
Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
Look, I already put out a press release citing 'creative differences,'
- so just let it go.
- You went to the press?
- Do we have everything?
- Alright.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
You ought to go.
I don't deserve you.
Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
'Creative differences'?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a Teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analysed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
According to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other 'name' is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
- I told you she was bad.
- No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
- 'Mike 'n' Ike's'?
- They're not just any 'Mike 'n' Ike's,' these are cherry 'Mike 'n' Ike's.'
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award- nominated director--
That was 'Short Subject.'
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look... pockets full of these things?
- I have a feeling you'll tell me.
- I'm going to tell you.
Because Ms Nicola Anders-- supermodel with a SAG card-- has it written in her contract that all cherry 'Mike 'n' Ike's' be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
We're at their mercy.
What happened?
We always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones that would tell them what to do.
We would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names at will.
- Yeah-- more than once.
- Viktor, do you realise you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
- Shine a light in that darkened cinema.
- It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
- Okay.
- I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York-- it's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old times' sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mum canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Okay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mum.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr Taransky?
Mr Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant wouldn't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call Security.
I'll call Security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr Taransky-- the answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading lady right here-- in my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr Taransky, don't-- don't you recognise me?
The 'Future of Film' Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech- 'Who Needs Humans?
'
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
I remember.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
In that whole time I never left my computer.
- Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
- Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this-- the eye tumour- microwaves from the screen.
- Oh dear, I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
- You have to see her.
- Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Well, you're talking about a 'syn-thespian,' a 'virtual actor.'
- No, we call them 'Vac-tors.' - 'Vac-tors'?
I need flesh.
- No, we call them 'Vac-tors.' - 'Vac-tors'?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- you're so perfect, Mr Taransky.
You have something...
that I don't have.
What's that?
An eye-- an eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- 'Straw God'-- that changed my life.
You saw 'Straw God'?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realise my vision.
You and me, art and science-- we're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But I tell you what, I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumour is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumour is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead, Hank.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
You don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door, for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr Taransky.
Mr Taransky!
- Mr Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
'Why are we here?
'
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No 'why'... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're supposed to believe that was 1 9th-century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys... who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too cartoony or anything?
- Who, the nun?
- Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh-- 'not of this earth.'
- And the rest of the film?
- She's a miracle, Dad.
Where did you find her?
Well, I saw her picture on the computer.
Computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about it?
Only your brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mum will take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film 'Sunrise, Sunset.'
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
'Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelly-- and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.'
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out, just like you said.
Very good.
- Mr Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitised.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep... and a little more...
Bacall.
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'?
How do I look?
- Give me Audrey.
- How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr Taransky?
I'm going to tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't I?
Of course...
with Hank's tragic passing, his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see-- see beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favour of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's 'real' anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
That's a grey area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
'To whom it may concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews,
- or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable--
I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone.'
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
Where did you find her?
- Is 'Simone' her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms Simone begins production on her new film today--
'Eternity Forever.' This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding 'Hank'?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
- And now?
- Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
- We gave you complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
They're cleaning the engine now.
- Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry-- nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't-
- Look, I have not read 'Eternity Forever,' but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of 'Clive.'
- 'Clyde.' - 'Clyde,' right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
- I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought
I would be perfect for 'Clyde' as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Do you think he'd be right for 'Eternity Forever'?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
We'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
- Anything you can do.
Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey...
- Is this some kind of jamming device?
- this is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work...
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is...
it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
We'll talk at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know it's not some middle-aged freak?
I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
Are you holding her hostage?
You're the hostage.
You look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss 'Eternity Forever.'
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself... you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and makeup?
- Does her own.
- In her theatre training.
- Oh, she was in the theatre?
- Where?
- I'll send you her resume.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
We've gotta do something about this-- stuntwoman.
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
She doesn't need one.
Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
Oh.
We'll shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but as Elaine, ex-wife-- hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously-- you got lucky this last time, but you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but as Viktor, your first former husband, what happened to you?
Hmm?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
Are they--
- They're all here.
- Okay, thank you.
- Hello.
- Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for 'Eternity Forever.'
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlett.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologising for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work,
I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say, except that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde,
- is that love--
- Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
Alright.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone...
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr Taransky.
Why do you have to bring that up?
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms Enomis.
- Ah, Ms Enomis.
Now, Ms Enomis demands her privacy, so you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone will escort Ms Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
- Who is it?
- It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're alright now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith, thank God for you.
I mean, this is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
Well... you know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
like her?
Oh, yes, of course, like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone.
What?
What did you say?
I said, do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me 'Simone'!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
- Is something wrong?
- Well, actually... maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the presidential suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir, I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture-- the picture-- it's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
Is she here?
Hey, Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
- Somebody said she was here.
- Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
- I'm your biggest fan!
- Simone!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview-- a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
- Our best people are on it, Mr Sayer.
- Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes.
Every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours...
and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once-- and then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman-- a 'tell-all' story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
- Mr Taransky gave me instructions--
- No!
- What are you doing?
- Mr Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for 'Eternity Forever.'
- They're in the toilet.
- She has to get out and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk-show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight
- that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
She is about the work and only the work!
This is overshadowing the work.
- If you can't handle her, I will.
- It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of 'Good for Nothing.' This is not a good time.
- It never is.
Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
We just want to have a meeting.
We can talk-- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this, are we?
What is all this, Viktor?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose... it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere, why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
- Spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights-- name it.
This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
- We can work with that.
- I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
- Thank you.
- Give her our best.
- That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
- It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you-- no, no-- don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really, but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well...
Alright.
Good.
Thanks, Viktor.
Thank you.
I'm gonna-- bye.
Tonight, on 'Frank Brand Live'-- since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, 'Sunrise, Sunset,' no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone--
until now.
I'm happy to say that she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
I mean, does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now is to put the attention back where it belongs-- on Mr Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic, Simone.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a 'Mr Right' in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
- I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in, is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love 'Eternity Forever.'
'Eternity Forever' is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of 'Eternity Forever.'
- He's a genius.
- You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star... but there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too... if you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot of the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh... and for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in the trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I've got to tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record-
- I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
Alright.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I've got to ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions
- not to take their eyes off the crowd.
- Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
Unreal.
Remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the 'Splendid Isolation' Tour.
Let's get you into hair and makeup.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 1 00,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only-
- Simone!
I love you L.A.
It's great to be here.
" Looking out on the morning rain "
" I used to feel so inspired "
" And when I knew I had to face another day "
" Lord, it made me feel so tired "
" Before the day I met you "
" Life was so unkind "
" But you're the key to my peace of mind "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" Like a natural woman "
" Oh, baby, what you've done to me "
" Done to me "
" You made me feel so good inside "
" Good inside "
" And I just wanna be "
" Wanna be "
" Close to you, you make me feel so alive "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" Like a natural woman "
" You make me feel "
- " You make me feel " - " You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel like a real... "
" You make me feel "
" Feel like a... "
" You make me feel like a real... "
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
" What you've done to me... "
" Natural woman. "
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favourite girls in all the world.
- We stopped by to congratulate Simone.
- Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good colour on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realise that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
Elaine, I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and Mum, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, but Mum doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- My God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here... beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you, but I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognise the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Oh, Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa!
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you alright?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
- Could you go to the Oscars with him?
- No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay, okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
Alright, I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And the winner of 'Best Actress'... is... oh my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for 'Sunrise, Sunset'...
Thank you.
...and Simone for 'Eternity Forever.'
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight, but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Ladies and gentlemen-- Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the 'Best Actress' category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also want to thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr Taransky, are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologise for what happened on 'Sunrise.'
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
'Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.'
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right when you smile, it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes-- that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in 'Eternity Forever.'
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this-- clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taking advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Got to go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighbourhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's...
already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that-- make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
But for some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning
- you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
- She's gonna retire.
- She'll never work again.
- Her public will demand that she does.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code moulded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There is no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me?
I made you first.
Well, we're back on 'Good Morning, Good Day,' and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel?
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean-- you know, make some confession-- because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career... but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie, so, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
But what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human--
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say, 'Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you.'
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop him.
Forgive me, Mr Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and Internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood... all fake?
Hmm?
This is fake?
This is fake?
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So I will confess... to fraud, but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this 'Hank Aleno' that you keep talking about, renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead.
Now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look-- even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's 'Sim one'-- see?
'Simulation one'!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body-- of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor, I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
- ...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood-- you killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated... so I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defence.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- 'I created her.'
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah-
- Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her-- like in the flesh?
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, Mum, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
We don't want to believe Daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey... there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mum.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
- What's that?
- Part of Dad's story may be true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity... due to the trauma of your divorce,
1 0 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her...
I bludgeoned her...
I set her on fire, and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news-- international media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of 'The LA Times.'
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now?
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where are we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
- What do you think, Lainey?
- About you and Mum?
Well, about me and Simone-- what I did-- everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake...
as long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from 'The Echo.'
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... 'Why?
'
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish bowl-- the insatiable appetite of the media-- with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work, and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby?
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, 'Chip,' is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me She's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- Not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually...
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are over inflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- Out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing...
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director...
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
...overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with...
look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her... three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking...
we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- Who to date...
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York...
Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that... or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You'reviktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your pray ers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from...
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't...
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs humans? "
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
U h-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the s creen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "s yn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "v ac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why...
that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- That I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and s cience...
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
they're at the door for God's sake.
hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
he wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 1 9th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on s creen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of thisearth.
- You should bevery proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what...
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was dis covered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely priv ate.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
they're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has thevoice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly... ha-ha...
and the face... of Audrey hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- Just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the s cales have tipped... naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances...
- This is unbeliev able.
- I politely request that the press respect my priv acy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today...
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
they were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't...
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's bus y right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
he's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to dis cuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's s cript notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- U h-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so dis ciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this...
- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying thevery people who dis covered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they...
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love s cenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
H i, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm hewlitt.
We can rehearse in priv ate if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, ob viously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doub t, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love...
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her priv acy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will es cort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your dis cretion.
U nderstood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the s cent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call meviktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- Or something.
- Are you bus y tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem...
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture...
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- She doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky?
they're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Ob viously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
they're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- And only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 4 2 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- Girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer... addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights...
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia...
it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you...
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you werevery beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna...
Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live...
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone... until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic s chedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just be cause I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much s creen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on s creen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press...
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not dis cuss my priv ate life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel sincey esterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." he's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she hasever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've ob tained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
U nless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember... no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone...
live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it'seasier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the ke y to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She'sexhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking adv antage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking aboutviktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don'texist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
The y have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
Thees calating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is thiselaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I...
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I reognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just...
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Os cars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's myexit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern tehnology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don'teven feel I belong in the Best Actress category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saweach other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right...
when you smile it...
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, hone y?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's noteven grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my s cript next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leavingearly.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
hi.
hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
U h... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But...
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a seret now, elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine...
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyalenough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematicalequation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being... a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if the y still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think allelementary s chools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowdedenough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have youever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don'teat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, beause...
I've defrauded millions.
The y'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, beause... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, the y'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but the y like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phone y-balone y world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world youexisted.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that lexist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorne y.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
" Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wishi had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
H mm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfetly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what the y were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone beause there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"...
See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you couldexplain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question...
altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn'texist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
H uh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
He y, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
...that she bought for you.
I did...
I can prove...
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and dis cs.
Where are the dis cs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where the y are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's dis cs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just...
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
He y, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted reognition.
I wanted to be appreiated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny herexistence?
I can never forgive that.
Beause obviously sheexisted, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it'sembarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well... we don't want to believe daddy beause we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can beured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a ps y chiatrist in Ventura, well-respeted, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abjet failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them the y can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today'sedition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, hone y.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- But thank you.
- Well, it was lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we doneenough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from theeho.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Goodevening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you'reeager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expeting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
hi.
Oh yes.

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are over inflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they 'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but They used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When the y were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- H ere we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- H e y, Dad.
- How are you, hone y?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Be cause it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
By e, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- H e y, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Pleas e, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight y ears ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
U h-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An e y e.
An e y e for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
H e wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no! Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 1 9th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingénue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
H e y, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't I?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See be yond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favour of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a grey area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine y ears ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are They involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, he y.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's bus y right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, hone y.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Hone y, I know you want to do charity work.
No, They've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would They do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- U h-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theatre training.
- Oh, she was in the theatre?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- even the fall from the plane?
- even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
H uh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are They--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when They're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, They're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, They're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and be yond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the s cent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you bus y tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', They're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
N ever stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 4 2 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- By e.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stay ed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am,
They're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that They're not about special effects.
And They are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could They have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
N ice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
H ere, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 1 00,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
Looking out
On the morning rain
I used to feel so inspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Oh, baby
What you've done to me
Done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I just wanna be
Wanna be
Close to you, you make me feel so alive
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
- You make me feel
- You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a real...
You make me feel
Feel like a...
You make me feel like a real...
Thank you.
N ever stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
What you've done to me
Natural woman.
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favourite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good colour on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Os cars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
By e.
- By e!
Goodbye.
Oh! And, the winner of Best Actress... I s...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky ,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
H ere.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, hone y?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighbourhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
U h... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code moulded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes! Had a rough night? Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight,
They'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but They like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
H ere I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
" Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
H e actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
H e was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
H mm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what They were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly .
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
H e y, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
- ...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where They are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
H e y, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defence.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 1 0 y ears of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them They can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, hone y.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
H e y, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
Looking out
On the morning rain
I used to feel so inspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
And didn't know what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
To what I'm living for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
Done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I just wanna be
Wanna be
Close to you, you make me feel so alive
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a real...
You make me feel
Feel like a real...
You make me feel like a real...
She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 19th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category,
let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight,
like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
Hmm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
-...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do,
living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# You're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# When my soul was in the lost and found #
# You came along to claim it #
# And didn't know what was wrong with me #
# Till your kiss helped me name it #
# Now I'm no longer doubtful #

# Oh, baby, what you've done to me #
# Done to me #

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 19th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category,
let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight,
like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
Hmm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
-...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do,
living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 19th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category,
let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight,
like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
Hmm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
-...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do,
living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# You're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# When my soul was in the lost and found #
# You came along to claim it #
# And didn't know what was wrong with me #
# Till your kiss helped me name it #
# Now I'm no longer doubtful #
# To what I'm living for #
# And if I make you happy #
# I don't need to do more #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Woman #
# Oh, baby, what you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me She's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- Not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually...
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are over inflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- Out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing...
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director...
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
...overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with...
look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her... three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking...
we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- Who to date...
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York...
Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that... or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You'reviktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your pray ers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from...
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't...
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs humans? "
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
U h-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the s creen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "s yn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "v ac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why...
that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- That I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and s cience...
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
they're at the door for God's sake.
hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
he wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 1 9th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on s creen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of thisearth.
- You should bevery proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what...
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was dis covered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely priv ate.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
they're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has thevoice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly... ha-ha...
and the face... of Audrey hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- Just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the s cales have tipped... naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances...
- This is unbeliev able.
- I politely request that the press respect my priv acy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today...
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
they were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't...
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's bus y right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
he's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to dis cuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's s cript notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- U h-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so dis ciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this...
- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying thevery people who dis covered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they...
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love s cenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
H i, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm hewlitt.
We can rehearse in priv ate if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, ob viously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doub t, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love...
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her priv acy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will es cort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your dis cretion.
U nderstood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the s cent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call meviktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- Or something.
- Are you bus y tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem...
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture...
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- She doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky?
they're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Ob viously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
they're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- And only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 4 2 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- Girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer... addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights...
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia...
it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you...
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you werevery beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna...
Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live...
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone... until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic s chedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just be cause I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much s creen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on s creen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press...
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not dis cuss my priv ate life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel sincey esterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." he's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she hasever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've ob tained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
U nless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember... no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone...
live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it'seasier to make 1 00,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the ke y to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She'sexhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking adv antage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking aboutviktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don'texist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
The y have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
Thees calating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is thiselaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I...
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I reognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just...
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Os cars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's myexit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern tehnology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don'teven feel I belong in the Best Actress category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saweach other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right...
when you smile it...
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, hone y?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's noteven grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my s cript next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leavingearly.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
hi.
hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
U h... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But...
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a seret now, elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine...
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyalenough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematicalequation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being... a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if the y still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think allelementary s chools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowdedenough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have youever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don'teat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, beause...
I've defrauded millions.
The y'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, beause... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, the y'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but the y like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phone y-balone y world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world youexisted.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that lexist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorne y.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
" Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wishi had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
H mm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfetly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what the y were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone beause there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"...
See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you couldexplain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question...
altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn'texist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
H uh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
He y, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
...that she bought for you.
I did...
I can prove...
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and dis cs.
Where are the dis cs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where the y are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's dis cs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just...
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
He y, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted reognition.
I wanted to be appreiated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny herexistence?
I can never forgive that.
Beause obviously sheexisted, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it'sembarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well... we don't want to believe daddy beause we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can beured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a ps y chiatrist in Ventura, well-respeted, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 1 0 years of abjet failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them the y can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today'sedition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, hone y.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- But thank you.
- Well, it was lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we doneenough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from theeho.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Goodevening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you'reeager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expeting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
hi.
Oh yes.

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 19th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category,
let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight,
like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
Hmm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
-...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do,
living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.

Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- N icola !
- This, this...
- not this.
- N icola !
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Be caus e I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in e v ery s cene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
H mm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
The y don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You'v e insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee !
Wait a minute.
The tires are ov erinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
H ere.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
N icola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
The y're going to shut me down !
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God !
The s cene with the thousand gees e?
!
I don't understand this film !
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press releas e citing creativ e differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we hav e e v erything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with thes e.
'Caus e you oughta go.
- I don't des erv e you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't des erv e you.
It des erv es much, much better than you !
Creativ e differences?
The difference is you're not creativ e.
To hell, pleas e.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I'v e analyzed this footage.
We'v e got e v erything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorne ys filed at noon today, the y'll sue if the film is releas ed with N icola in a single frame.
The y will sue, Viktor.
The y're s erious.
So let's re cast.
N icola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
N icola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of cours e she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't s ell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we e v er want to be in the N icola Anders business again, we hav e to cut our loss es and shelv e the picture.
No!
I will not giv e in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always hav e to make things so difficult for yours elf?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what thes e are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
The y're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
Thes e are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated dire ctor--
Viktor, that was "Short Subje ct."
--ov ers eeing the most cherished movie proje ct of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of thes e... things?
!
I hav e a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Be caus e Ms. N icola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be remov ed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must hav e s e v en packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she trav els, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't hav e children.
Don't you s ee?
The y're mocking us.
The y're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but the y us ed to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When the y were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't e v en born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You s eem to hav e forgotten.
- Oh, pleas e.
Come on.
N ew York-
- Cassav etes.
Remember?
- H ere we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a proje ctor.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I hav e good memories of thos e days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about inv estment and return.
I'm not interested in inv estment and return !
I'm not interested in who pays for anything !
I'm trying to make a movie !
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Thos e days in N ew York...
It's ov er, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromis ed a little.
Well, it's not e v ery day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Laine y.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad !
- Sweetheart.
- H e y, Dad.
- How are you, hone y?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Laine y, I'm going to finish it.
Be caus e it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
By e, Dad.
- H i, sweetheart.
- H e y, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I'v e been trying to s ee you.
I'v e been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Pleas e, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked e v ery part of her.
- I'm going to call s e curity.
I'll call s e curity if you don't back off.
I hav e her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your pray ers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I hav e your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Pleas e, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me !
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you re cognize me?

Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a ke ynote speaker.
You must remember my spee ch.
- "Who N eeds H umans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight y ears ago.
And that whole time I ne v er left my computer.
U h-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caus ed this.
The e y e tumor.
- Microwav es from the s creen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, be caus e it was worth it.
You hav e to s ee her.
Oh, I'v e s een thos e.
- No t ll ke thi s.
- I'll take care o f that.
Yeah, well, yo u're talki ng abo ut a "syn-thespl an."
- A I rtual acto r.
- No , we call the m "ac-to rs."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfe ct.
You hav e something...
- that I don't hav e.
- What's that?
An e y e.
An e y e for performance.
You know the truth when you s ee it.
I know.
I mean, I'v e s een your movies.
I lov e your movies.
- You lov e my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I hav e s een e v ery frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and s cience--
We're the perfe ct marriage.
Hank...
I'v e had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me !
This week!
Pleas e.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't hav e a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I'v e mortgaged e v erything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
The y're at the door for God's sake.
H ello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him !
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him !
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I repres ent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you hav e this.
What is it?
I hav e no idea.
H e wanted you to hav e it.
Valarie!
Valarie !
Valarie !
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarl e, no ! Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to s end a message to the acting community who... put thems elv es abov e the work, who put thems elv es abov e me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppos e to belie v e that was 1 9th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the s ets when she's on s creen?
Oh, y eah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be v ery proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expe cting a train wre ck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I hav e a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzll ng new l ng enue has co me fro m see ml ng ly no where to capture the hearts o f mo l e-g o l ng audi ences aro und the wo rld to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world
in her debut film "Sunris e, Suns et."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the s e cre cy?
All we know for sure is that she was dis cov ered by little-known dire ctor, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone !
Simone?
- Good to s ee you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Be caus e she would ne v er come to something like this.
She's intens ely priv ate.
Back to work, e v eryone.
She's not here.
H e y, listen.
Hav e you read the re views?
The y're lov e letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audre y H epburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a re clus e.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates hers elf in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, hav e it your way, Viktor.
H ello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arriv ed before you got here.
She's going to leav e long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody els e e v er to enter this s et without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We hav e stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to dete ct it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You'v e got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audre y H epburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Giv e me Audre y.
How do I look?
Perfe ct.
Perfe ct, Simone.
Perfe ct.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so mys elf.
You did create me.
I just brought someone els e's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you e v er going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of cours e... with Hank's tragic passing,
his s e cret did die with him.
This is a classic cas e of te chnology in s earch of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can s ee.
See be yond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can s ee that with the ris e in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the s cales hav e tipped-- naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can s ee that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors thes e days hav e digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, howe v er, hav e a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public respons e to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelie v able.
- I politely request that the press respe ct my priv acy and let the work speak for its elf.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Fore v er."
This is a proje ct which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine y ears ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are the y involv ed?
The y were at one time ins eparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gav e you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- The y're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, he y.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against N icola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were ne v er together.
- Still, the conne ction was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I hav e not read "Eternity Fore v er,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfe ct for the part of Cliv e.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfe ct.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She ne v er mentioned it.
- She's bus y right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly s ens ed that she thought I would be perfe ct for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excus e me.
Sure.
H ello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll ne v er guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not e v en clos e.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conv ersation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Fore v er"?
H e's not the right type?
You want to go in another dire ction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, hone y.
What is this, some kind of jamming de vice?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to hims elf.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Hone y, I know you want to do charity work.
No, the y'v e taken spe cial pre cautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would the y do that?
Well, whate v er it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach hous e this weekend.
- Can you e v er stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll los e yours elf in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in thos e chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Laine y, leav e the computer, pleas e.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her fore v er!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captiv e to me.
Laine y, don't you e v er wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- By e, Dad.
- By e, hone y.
H ello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
H e y, you want to come in?
- H i.
- H i, Hone y.
- H i, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply hav e to dis cuss
"Eternity Fore v er."
I still hav en't re ceiv ed Simone's s cript notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers hers elf, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We hav e to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine s ervice.
- She driv es hers elf.
- U h-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll s end it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so dis ciplined.
Well, we'v e gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- E v en the fall from the plane?
- E v en the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio H ead, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
H e y, s e cond ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this ov erblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Dire ctor, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
H uh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I'v e s een this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Thes e young stars destroying the v ery people who dis cov ered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
H i, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I'v e always belie v ed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are the y--
- The y're all here.
Okay, thank you.
H ello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to hav e such a wonderful cast ass embled here for "Eternity Fore v er."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoe v er.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our lov e s cenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you hers elf before filming started.
I belie v e she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leav e me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
H i, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yours elv es.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
H i, Simone.
I'm Corel.
H i, I'm Claris.
You us ed to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm H ewlitt.
We can rehears e in priv ate if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't belie v e I'm talking to you.
We are going to be come such great friends.
H i, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that e v eryone?
Well, ob viously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who els e?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when the y're not actually there.
Oh, of cours e.
Of cours e.
I don't hav e much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great proje ct if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doub t, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that lov e--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that lov e is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a v ery high cliff.
Perfe ct.
Perfe ct.
Sl mo ne.
Sl mo ne.
Sl mo ne.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You hav e no idea the effe ct your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
Thes e films, the y're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing liv es.
People need to belie v e you're real.
To re v eal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you hav e to bring that up?
!
I mean, e v erything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We'v e done enough work today.
You'v e been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, the y're going to s ee you with their own e y es.
Excus e me.
I will be che cking in a v ery spe cial guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her priv acy.
So, you will switch off all surv eillance cameras.
I alone, will es cort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoe v er.
I'm sure I can rely on your dis cretion.
U nderstood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is !
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think e v erybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way abov e and be yond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you hav e no idea the s ervice you'v e performed for Simone, shielding her from thes e animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many dire ctors would go to so much trouble to prote ct an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna hav e to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the s cent.
Of cours e.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, y es, of cours e.
Like her.
But you're so v ery beautiful in your own right.
I do find mys elf strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whate v er you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone !
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, pleas e.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Pleas e, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be clos e to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excus e me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you bus y tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of e v erything.
Yes, sir.
I belie v e it will.
Leav e me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine !
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a re v elation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa !
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone !
- Simone !
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone !
- I got your glass !
I'm your biggest fan !
Simone !
- Simone !
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't e v en get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody e v er gets a photograph.
We hav e our best people on it, Mr. Say er.
Get better people !
What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky?
The y're camped out e v ery place he goes; e v ery concierge, e v ery maitre d', the y're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Ob viously, that is not her real name.
She us es an assumed identity.
She trav els under a fals e name.
She che cks into a hotel under an alias.
N e v er stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we hav e some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfe ct, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You hav e one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Pleas e don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gav e me spe cific instructions ne v er to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We hav e to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We'v e got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Fore v er."
The y're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and s ell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
E v en Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were aliv e !
It is pre cis ely be caus e she doesn't crav e the limelight that people lov e her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is ov ershadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 4 2 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It ne v er is.
- Step aside !
- We're going in !
- This is ridiculous !
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone !
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine !
- We just want to hav e a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the s ets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppos e it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relie v ed in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of cours e.
I should hav e guess ed.
It's why she ne v er goes anywhere,
- Why she's ne v er s een in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be hers elf.
- Anonymous.
Only it's wors e.
It's far wors e.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a tele vision talk show or something.
Yes !
- Taped.
- Make it liv e, pleas e.
- Liv e?
- Pleas e.
She'd ne v er go there.
It would hav e to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promis e anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grov el.
Thank you.
Giv e her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to prote ct her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to hav e that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were v ery beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd lov e to, really., but don't you hav e to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- By e.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Liv e--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunris e, Suns et,"
no one has managed to land a liv e tele vision interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the s et of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your he ctic s chedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accus e you of being ov erexpos ed, Simone.
Why hav e you stay ed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just be caus e I hav e a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of cours e, the problem with shying away from publicity thes e days is that it tends to attract e v en more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't s e cretly want the attention?
I'm not e v en sure I des erv e it.
You s ee, after tonight,
I'll hav e just as much s creen time on your show as I hav e in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Be caus e you hav e to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on s creen and who I really am, the y're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You hav e been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Ste v en Hawking, Fidel Castro, most re cently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not dis cuss my priv ate life.
But Viktor and I, we are ins eparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
N udity's just ne v er been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two proje cts?
I suppos e what I like most about the movies I'm in is that the y're not about spe cial effe cts.
And the y are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we los e you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodby e.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I'v e been here before.
On my hone ymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could the y hav e built that hotel since y esterday?
Get in the car.
Simone !
Simone !
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cov er.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we hav e this conv ersation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna lov e "Eternity Fore v er."
"Eternity Fore v er" is my finest work.
I lov ed working with the dire ctor of "Eternity Fore v er." H e's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express mys elf.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You hav e to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
N ice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't hav e time for this.
I think you do, 'caus e I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You us ed an old library shot for the background.
She ne v er was in N ew Mexico.
She ne v er e v en left the studio.
I'v e done my homework.
- I'v e studied her.
- I bet you hav e.
I'v e looked at e v ery pie ce of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no e vidence that she has e v er left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leav es no paper trail?
Now, I'v e ob tained a copy of your bank account.
I know you hav e power of attorne y, but so far, you hav e not turned ov er a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to belie v e, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a s erious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the re cord.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to s ee her.
U nless you show me Simone liv e and in person,
I show thes e photos to the authorities.
You want to s ee her?
All right.
You'v e got a deal.
You want to s ee her?
You're gonna s ee her!
Good !
Mr. Taransky.
- H ello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could'v e sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound che ck went great.
The las er show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, s e curity guards are under strict instructions ne v er to take their e y es off the crowd.
Excellent.
H ere, Simone wanted you to hav e thes e.
- U nreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to pres ent Simone-- liv e on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 1 00,000 belie v e than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone !
I lov e you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
Looking out
On the morning rain
I us ed to feel so inspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the ke y to my peace of mind
'Caus e you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Oh, baby
What you'v e done to me
Done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I just wanna be
Wanna be
Clos e to you, you make me feel so aliv e
'Caus e you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
- You make me feel
- You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a real...
You make me feel
Feel like a...
You make me feel like a real...
Thank you.
N e v er stop belie ving.
Yeah !
Simone !
What you'v e done to me
Natural woman.
I said I didn't want to be disturbed !
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't belie v e she's doing this.
Taking adv antage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Ob viously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too s ensitiv e.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I hav e to talk to her.
I'v e been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your lov e life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Laine y.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't hav e a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
The y hav e to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The es calating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was ov ershadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations.
- H ello?
- H ello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh !
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- H i !
- H i.
I'm really late.
I would lov e to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to s ee Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to s ee Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still hav e feelings for him.
Well, we hav e a daughter together.
I don't lov e Viktor.
I could ne v er lov e anyone.
I'm in lov e with the camera.
Simone, I re cognize the coat you're wearing.
I gav e it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God !
Oh my God !
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Os cars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, pleas e, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, y es.
By e.
- By e !
Goodby e.
Oh ! And, the wl nner o f BYest Actress... I s...
Oh, my goodness.
We hav e a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunris e, Suns et"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Fore v er."
U nfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern te chnology, she joins us liv e from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone !
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't e v en feel I belong in the Best Actress category, let alone with thes e wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of cours e.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I lov e you, Hank, where v er you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
H er agent?
- H er father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of cours e, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of cours e, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of cours e, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, wltho ut who m no ne o f thi s wo uld be po ssl ble.
Excuse me, lM r.
Taransky ,
Are you ready for your casting s ession?
N icola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, y eah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I ne v er got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunris e."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting class es.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... giv e in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of cours e.
Of cours e it is.
You hav e such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, y eah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Laine y.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drov e in "Eternity Fore v er."
- I know.
- See?
- You hav e to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to driv e it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
H ere.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, hone y?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll giv e you whate v er you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to s ee you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It us ed to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not e v en grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yours elf.
Can't you s ee what she's done to you?
She's taken adv antage.
Mocking you.
You des erv e better than Simone.
- I hav e to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We'v e be come v ery clos e.
She told me she wanted to look at my s cript next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach hous e having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, pleas e.
Elaine.
H i.
H i.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't us e the front door anymore?
U h... no.
When is she coming ov er?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming ov er tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather hav e you than Simone.
- Belie v e me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I hav e stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You hav e?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll ne v er work again.
Of cours e she will.
H er public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a s e cret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I inv ented her.
E v ery actor is an inv ention.
- Elaine--
- Pleas e.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much hav e you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I'v e done the impossible.
I hav e re created the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I hav e taken nothing, and made it something.
I hav e breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, pleas e stop.
- Pleas e.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes !
Yes !
Yes ! Had a ro ug h nl g ht? Let's see lf they still lo e yo u after thi s.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controv ersial position.
I just think all elementary s chools should hav e a firing range.
How els e can the children learn to defend thems elv es?
If there is a hole in the ozone lay er, how come I can't s ee it?
Immigration?
God !
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Hav e you e v er tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
E v erybody always talks about the negativ es of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you'v e got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a s erial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, be caus e...
I'v e defrauded millions.
The y'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, be caus e... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, the y'd ne v er let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but the y like her e v en more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you lov e me anymore?
It's ov er, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
Thl s l s a pho ney-balo ney wo rld.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you liv e, too?
You're more authentic than all thes e people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told mys elf this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
H ere I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to hav e to restructure your deal.
Can I s ee you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You hav e the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be us ed against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake !
- I'll call my attorne y.
Dad !
Elaine, call Bernard !
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
" Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
H e actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
H e's a sick man.
H e was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame mys elf.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgiv e me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all thes e films and TV appearances and magazine cov ers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
H mm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfe ctly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what the y were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't hav e killed Simone be caus e there was no Simone.
- Rl g ht.
Exactly .
- And thi s Hank Aleno that yo u keep talkl ng abo ut, the reno wned failure who also happens to be so co nenl ently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped inv ent Simone,
is an inv ention hims elf.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane !
There is no Simone !
Look.
E v en her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One" !
It's a computer code !
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's clos ed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of cours e.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
H uh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
H e y, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
- ...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prov e--
I can prov e it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prov e it.
H ere.
H ere.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll s ee.
What is this?
No, there's driv es and dis cs.
Where are the dis cs?
You hav e to go back down and get them.
- That's where the y are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's dis cs down there !
- Calm yours elf!
- Pleas e !
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the driv es.
H e y, you s ee what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yours elf on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me !
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted re cognition.
I wanted to be appre ciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defens e.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus !
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawy er.
I want another lawy er!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgiv e him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can ne v er forgiv e that.
Be caus e ob viously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I e v er met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Laine y, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I ne v er met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I hav en't.
I'v e ne v er really s een Simone up clos e... touched her.
Been in her physical pres ence.
Hav e you?
Well-- we don't want to belie v e daddy be caus e we don't want to belie v e that we were taken in too.
But, Laine y, there's no e vidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any e vidence that she is?
Do you hav e any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may hav e been true.
Simone may hav e contracted a virus.
Certain virus es can be cured.
I hav e no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a ps y chiatrist in Ventura, well-respe cted, who is willing to testify under oath that you hav e diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 1 0 y ears of abje ct failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this hors eshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them the y can fry me.
- No, Viktor, pleas e.
- I did it!
- Viktor, pleas e.
It was premeditated !
- Can you pleas e lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I s et her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excus e me.
I think you better s ee this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is aliv e and well.
H er studio releas ed this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
H e's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, hone y.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Laine y.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we hav e to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can hav e a whole cast?
You hav e to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Hav en't we done enough?
- Could we go, pleas e?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Laine y?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Laine y?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
E v erything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death s entence.
No.
It's life.
H e y, Viktor, remember us?
We probably ne v er met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Say er from the E cho.
- H i !
- It's life.
Just call.
Fiv e minutes.
All we need is fiv e minutes.
Good e v ening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on e v erybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with e v erything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expe cting.
It's true.
I can re v eal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppos e this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You s ee, Viktor and I are both v ery concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, y es.
H i.
Oh y es.
Looking out
On the morning rain
I us ed to feel so inspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the ke y to my peace of mind
'Caus e you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
And didn't know what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doub tful
To what I'm living for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more
'Caus e you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman
Oh, baby, what you'v e done to me
Done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I just wanna be
Wanna be
Clos e to you, you make me feel so aliv e
'Caus e you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a real...
You make me feel
Feel like a real...
You make me feel like a real...
She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 19th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category,
let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight,
like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
Hmm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
-...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do,
living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# You're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# When my soul was in the lost and found #
# You came along to claim it #
# And didn't know what was wrong with me #
# Till your kiss helped me name it #
# Now I'm no longer doubtful #

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually...
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing...
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director...
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with...
look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her... three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking...
we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date...
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York...
Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that... or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from...
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't...
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why...
that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science...
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 19th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what...
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly... ha-ha...
and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
Death of real.
Death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't I?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped... naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances...
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today...
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't...
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this...
- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they...
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love...
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture...
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer... addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights...
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia...
it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you...
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna...
Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live...
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone... until now.
She's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press...
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember... no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone...
live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.

Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I...
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just...
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
And Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right...
when you smile it...
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But...
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine...
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being... a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
But what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
Hmm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"...
See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question...
altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
- that she bought for you.
I did...
I can prove...
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just...
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well... we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Uh, Mr. Taransky.
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
Nicola!
This.
This.
Not this.
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
No.
No.
Is this about the new pages?
Because I made all the changes you wanted, Nicola.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
It was the biggest on Earth.
I swear, Nicola, it's a fifty-foot Airstream.
They don't make 'em any longer.
Taller, Viktor.
- Taller.
Taller.
- What?
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right, it's actually taller.
I mean, it's amazing.
- Coffee!
- Wait a minute now.
The tires are over-inflated.
See?
It's just this.
Here.
See?
See?
Look.
Here.
See?
- The air comes right out.
- This is so sad.
See, it's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you, don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed onto this picture out of loyalty.
Well, then show me some.
They're gonna shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor!
I mean, my God.
The scene with the thousand geese!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is gonna understand this film!
Look.
I already put out a press release citing "creative differences."
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
Because I don't want to come back here.
You know what?
You're right, Nicola.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
Let me help you with these.
Gosh, you ought a go.
I don't deserve you.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you.
"Creative differences"?
The difference is, you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
I'm right beside you.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments we can finish this film without her.
According to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Well, Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is gonna sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not gonna play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever wanna be in the Nicola Anders business again we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give into that blackmailing...
Viktor, let's take a walk.
- Ridiculous performance.
- I told you she was bad.
No, yours, in there!
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
- I'm being difficult?
- Yes.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
- Mike and Ikes?
- They're not just any Mike and Ikes.
These are cherry Mike and Ikes.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky two-time Academy Award nominated director...
Viktor, that was short subject.
...overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career I am walking around with...
Look.
Pockets full of these things!
- I have a feeling you're gonna tell me.
- I'm gonna tell you why.
Because, Miss Nicola Anders supermodel with a SAG card has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike and Ikes be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal Jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
- So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us, Elaine.
We're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.
We were the ones that would tell 'em what to do.
We would tell 'em what to wear, who to date.
- That's what you want?
- When they were under contract to us we could change their names if we wanted to.
Yeah.
More than once.
Viktor, you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on!
New York, Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Oh, here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important?
I don't know, shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector, Viktor.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
Viktor, I have good memories of those days too.
I do.
But this isn't about that...
Or you or me or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
- This is about investment and return.
- I'm not interested!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm tryin' to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
- You're not renewing my contract?
- How can I?
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star's gonna work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.
- How are ya, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Well, I'm gonna finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm gonna finish it because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
You okay?
Let's go.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant, she wouldn't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid that I wasn't gonna get to you in time.
Please, just keep your distance, all right?
I did it!
I licked skin.
I licked hair.
I licked every part of her.
I'm gonna call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading lady right here in my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from.
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was the keynote speaker there.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
Right, you were booed off the stage.
- That's gotta be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time, I never left my computer.
- Well, good for you, Hank.
- Well, it's good and bad.
I think that's what caused this, the eye tumor.
Microwaves from the screen.
- Oh, gee, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't be, 'cause it was worth it.
- You have to see her.
- Oh, I've seen those people.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talkin' about a "synthespian", a virtual actor.
No, we call them "vactors".
See?
- I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
- It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You... and me...
We can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
Well, see that's why they're so perfect, Mr. Taransky.
You have something that I don't have.
What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it, I know.
I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God" that changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science.
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today, but I'll tell ya what.
I'll call you about this next week.
I won't be here in a week, the tumor's inoperable.
I'll call ya about it, okay?
No, but listen.
That's what I'm tryin' to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
I'm already dead, Hank.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
You don't understand.
I mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door, for God's sake.
Damn it.
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
- Valarie, what are you running from?
- From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... what is it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why.
Just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
I know I may be guilty of a crime but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who put themselves above the work.
Who put themselves above me.
- So, what'd you guys think?
- So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're really supposed to believe that was nineteenth century Lisbon.
Hey, guys, who's lookin' at the sets when she's on screen?
There he is!
That's my Dad, Viktor Taransky!
She was magnificent.
- Absolutely unreal.
- Breathtaking.
She wasn't too cartoony or anything?
- Who?
The nun?
- Or are you talkin' about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
She's not of this Earth.
You should be very proud.
Oh, not of this Earth?
That's really well put.
And the rest of the film.
What did you think?
She's a miracle, Dad.
Where did you find her?
I saw her picture on the computer.
- A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about it?
Only your brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.
You really pulled it off.
- I did?
- Yeah.
I have a feeling mom's gonna take you back after this.
- Back on the lot.
That's what I meant.
- I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingénue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset".
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone.
Simone?
- Good to see you too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Well, why isn't she with you?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work everyone, she's not here.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
"Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelly.
And the face of Audrey Hepburn, combined with an angel."
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
- I don't know if that's gonna happen.
- Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She... isolates herself in her art.
- Viktor, it's my studio.
- Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios, Elaine.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone comin' in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's gonna leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is digitized!
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
Death of real.
Death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
Little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it there's a little something I wanna add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Gimme Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeroes.
I was nothing.
Well that's true.
I don't wanna boast, but...
Are you ever gonna tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm gonna tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't I?
Of course, with Hank's tragic passing his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case, isn't it?
Of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity.
Someone with vision.
Someone who can see.
To see beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake that the scales have tipped naturally, in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm gonna tell the truth about you, after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're gonna fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom It May Concern.
I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
I will be conducting no interviews or making publicity appearances.
I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
- Who is Simone dating?
- Where'd you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
I will make my final statement.
Miss Simone begins production on her new film today...
"Eternity Forever".
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute, Mr. Taransky.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, they're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
I mean, nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that...
God, Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- Well, you were never together, Hal.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
I have not read "Eternity Forever", but it is fantastic.
And I know that I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
Clyde.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look.
I ran into Simone on the lot.
Really?
Oh, she never mentioned it.
Well, she's very busy right now.
People comin' at her from all angles.
Maybe she don't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- A strong reading.
Simone.
It's so great to hear from ya.
How are ya, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
Hal Sinclair.
What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You wanna go in another direction?
- We'll try and talk her into it.
- Anything you could do, Viktor.
- Anything.
- Yeah, uh, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
They've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Whatever it is...
It's dark.
Dark?
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
- Dad, I know plenty of boys.
- You do?
Who?
I mean, where do you meet 'em?
You meet 'em in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talkin' to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
Beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
Young Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is goin' on?
What are ya doin' here?
You're trespassing.
You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
What are you, holdin' her hostage?
You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kinda captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
Love you.
- Bye, honey.
- Hello, Viktor.
- Sorry I got her back late.
I...
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you wanna come in?
Hi, honey.
Hi, Vic.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss "Eternity Forever".
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself you know, an instrument.
- So she's gonna do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
Well, we have to do something about this budget, Viktor.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
She drives herself.
- Hair and makeup.
- Does her own.
In her theater training.
Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her résumé?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this, Viktor.
- "Stuntwoman".
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
We'll shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I wanna talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
No, seriously.
You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine talking to you now, not as Viktor, director but as Viktor, you're first former husband what happened to you?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered 'em.
I'm worried about you, Viktor, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry, I understand.
Are they...
- Oh, they're all here.
- Okay, thank you.
I just wanna say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever".
A reminder, as a condition for working on this picture you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
- For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
- Simone, are you there?
- I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are gonna become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know...
I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just wanna start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
I don't have much to say except that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love...
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right, smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it.
Isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
Cooped up in there too long.
So how about you and I goin' out on the town?
Tonight, they're gonna see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest, a Miss Enomis.
Ah.
Miss Enomis.
Now, Miss Enomis demands her privacy.
So you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Miss Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for ya, Faith.
Thank God for ya.
I mean this is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone.
Shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky, thank God for you.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress.
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place just to keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like like her?
Oh, yes, of course, like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone.
What'd you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Oh, call me Simone.
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I wanna know what it's like to be her just for one night.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
- Excuse me just a minute, I...
- Is something wrong?
Well, actually maybe we can do this some other time or somethin'.
Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen the presidential suite.
Think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
There she is.
- The picture.
It's a revelation.
- Thank you.
Oh, we all worked so hard.
- It was you.
It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
Viktor!
Is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
- Where is she?
- Oh, Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, Viktor, where is she?
I don't know.
She's...
- Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me, she doesn't really exist.
Simone's here?
Why didn't anybody tell me?
I got your glass!
Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
Yeah, we have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the twenty-four-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes every concierge, every maitre would, they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously that is not her real name.
- She uses an assumed identity.
- She travels under a false name.
Checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints a lot of yours and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had somethin' on Mother Theresa once and then she died and just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions to never open up this door.
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
- We know she's in there, Viktor.
- Okay.
What is all this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever".
- They're in the toilet.
- She's gotta sell the film, Viktor.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive today!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- She's about the work and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
This is not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".
This is not a good time.
It never is, Viktor.
Step aside.
This is ridic...
I trusted you.
- You can come out, it's Elaine.
- We just wanna have a meeting.
We can talk, girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this, are we?
What is all this, Viktor?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer addict.
- What?
- She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should've guessed.
I mean it's why she's never goes anywhere, why she's never seen in public.
Now you're gettin' it.
Probably spends her whole time in chat rooms.
It's the one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
- Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs places, heights.
Name it.
Oh, this is terrible.
How's she gonna plug the film?
Viktor, she has to do publicity.
Well, maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
- Taped.
- Oh, make it live, please.
She'd never go there.
So it would have to be remote.
- We can work with that.
- I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- All right.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
That agoraphobia, it's like a plague.
It's outta control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
- No.
No.
Don't touch that.
- Oh.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that...
Oh.
She was there.
She was right there.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you wanna go and get somethin' to eat or somethin'?
Oh, Viktor, I'd love to.
Really.
But don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
- All right.
Good.
Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna... bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset" no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone, until now.
I'm happy to say that she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you could find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
Well, no one can accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
I mean, does the world really wanna hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
She is all woman.
Of course the problem with shying away from publicity is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now is to put the attention back where it belongs on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight...
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am they're two totally different people.
Change of topic, Simone.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press...
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking...
Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor, you dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How 'bout the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone.
- I just want to say thank you.
- Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before, on my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
That's a mountain.
A hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
Simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Website interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever".
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever".
- He's a genius.
- You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star too.
If you really wanna make a difference.
- Nice boat, Taransky!
- Not a boat it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
I've studied her.
Bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh, and for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in the trust.
Yeah, I know that's what you want people to believe but, I gotta tell ya, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record, I wanna know how you're doin' it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person...
I show these photos to the authorities.
You wanna see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You wanna see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Ah.
Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready, Mr. Taransky.
Tomorrow night, she'll be standing here in front of thousands of people.
We could've sold this out twenty times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Very good.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone, live on stage for the debut concert of the "Splendid Isolation" tour.
Let's get you into hair and makeup.
You know, it's easier to make a hundred thousand believe than just one.
And now, the one, the only Simone.
I love you...
L.A. It's great to be here.
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
I said I didn't wanna be disturbed!
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know, she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
Elaine...
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life, Lain?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me...
Married to my work.
I noticed.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and Mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Aw, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
- I have no relationship with Simone.
- I know.
But Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well...
I'll think of somethin'.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life and threat of all out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh, my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks.
- Where are you?
- I'm right here, beside you.
I borrowed Viktor's car.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to ya but I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh.
No, oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I don't wanna see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone...
I recognize the coat you're wearing...
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ...
Elaine, I just...
Oh, my God.
I tell ya.
Are you all right, Simone?
This does look awful, I know that.
But...
Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no!
If you won't do it for him, I ask you please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay, for you.
For you, I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
Well, I'm glad that we talked.
- Bye!
- Good Bye!
And, the winner of best actress is...
Oh, my goodness, we have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset".
And...
Simone for "Eternity Forever".
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology she joins us live from her Goodwill tour of the third world.
Simone!
Thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the best actress category let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank.
Without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
Her father.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator, Viktor Taransky without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator, Viktor Taransky without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator, Viktor Taransky without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky.
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
- Yeah.
Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened.
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role...
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos...
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just give into you without a fight, like I did the last time?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
That was just wonderful.
- Wonderful acting.
- Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line...
Right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
When you smile it...
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
Fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever".
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- Well, it's from both of us.
You won't be able to drive it till you get your permit but you can take it around the lot.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
Whatever you want, sweetie.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taking advantage, mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
Really?
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane.
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
So if anybody needs me...
I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine!
Hi!
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
No!
When is she coming over?
About now.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back too, Viktor.
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy, Viktor.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
What woman can, Viktor?
I'd rather have you than Simone, believe me.
Oh.
That's so sweet.
But no!
I can't let you do that.
God, this is strange.
I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am, Viktor.
Well, it goes with the territory.
But for some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I don't know, there's a goodness to her, Viktor.
Oh, no, there's nothing to her.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- You would, Viktor.
- She's gonna retire.
- She'll never work again.
- Yeah, of course she will.
- Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
You?
How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.
Look.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you, Viktor.
Listen.
She's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation I inherited from a madman.
- How much have you had to drink?
- There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being a human soul.
I have taken nothing and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
Please.
I swear, Elaine.
As God as my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love ya after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning.
Good Day" and we are here once again with the incomparable, Simone.
Now, Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God, isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- She speaks her mind.
- She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle because if she suddenly stopped working you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career but they liked her even more.
Hank, what am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't ya love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinkin', Simone.
This is a phony-baloney world.
We're all livin' one big lie.
So why shouldn't you live too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're lookin' at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
But what I was really trying to do was convince 'em that I existed.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad...
And solemn duty to announce the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're gonna have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend.
Viktor, how could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh, my God.
This has gotta be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor.
- Call my attorney.
- Dad.
- Elaine!
Call Bernard!
- That's why it was so light.
I heard him say, "Die, bitch."
"I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and Internet interviews, publicity photos snapshots from her childhood...
AII fake?
This is fake.
This is fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions that's also bogus?
- No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshiping is is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
So you couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about a renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead.
Now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's Sim One.
See?
Simulation One!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't ya?
Perhaps you could explain this to me.
Or is this tape doctored too?
This is footage from the marina's closed circuit camera on the night in question...
Altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Yes, sir, I know.
Why don't you just come clean?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
Well, I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
We all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat that she bought for you.
I can prove it to ya.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take ya to the spot.
I can prove it.
We can just go there, can't we?
I'll take ya there.
Come on.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drivers and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them, because that's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
Calm yourself.
You must go down there and get the drivers.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Listen to me!
- Viktor!
Viktor.
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
- Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
- There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated so I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
What am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
- I want another lawyer!
- Sit down!
Viktor, sit.
Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence.
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there, sweetheart.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
- So you did meet her?
- Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, Mom but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close touched her... been in her physical presence.
Have you?
We don't wanna believe Daddy because we don't wanna believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talkin' about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity due to the trauma of your divorce ten years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
- No.
No, Viktor, come on now.
- Tell 'em they can fry me.
No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor.
Viktor, please.
- It was premeditated!
- Lower your voice.
I strangled her!
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news.
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of the L.A. Times.
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it but thank you.
- Oh, well, it was Lainey but don't thank us too fast, Viktor.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
- Where we going?
Well, I was thinking how 'bout you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
- Whaddya think, Lainey?
- About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake...
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor!
Remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes!
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish bowl the insatiable appetite of the media with everything that was going on in my life...
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
- Aren't you, Viktor?
- Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
She likes chicken pot pie just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are overinflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 19th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 100,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the key to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Oscars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category,
let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight,
like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
Hmm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
-...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do,
living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me She's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- Not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually...
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are over inflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- Out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing...
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director...
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
...overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with...
look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her... three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking...
we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- Who to date...
- That's what you want?
!
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York...
Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that... or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You'reviktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your pray ers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Please, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from...
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't...
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs humans? "
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
U h-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the s creen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "s yn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "v ac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why...
that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- That I don't have.
- What's that?
An eye.
An eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and s cience...
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
they're at the door for God's sake.
hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
he wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 1 9th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on s creen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of thisearth.
- You should bevery proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what...
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was dis covered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely priv ate.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
they're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has thevoice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly... ha-ha...
and the face... of Audrey hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- Just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't i?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the s cales have tipped... naturally in favor of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a gray area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances...
- This is unbeliev able.
- I politely request that the press respect my priv acy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today...
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are they involved?
they were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't...
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's bus y right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
he's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to dis cuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's s cript notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- U h-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so dis ciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this...
- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
Huh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying thevery people who dis covered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are they...
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love s cenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
H i, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm hewlitt.
We can rehearse in priv ate if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, ob viously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doub t, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love...
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her priv acy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will es cort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your dis cretion.
U nderstood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the s cent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call meviktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- Or something.
- Are you bus y tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem...
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture...
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- She doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky?
they're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Ob viously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
they're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- And only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 4 2 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- Girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer... addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights...
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia...
it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you...
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you werevery beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna...
Bye.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live...
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone... until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic s chedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just be cause I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much s creen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on s creen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press...
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not dis cuss my priv ate life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel sincey esterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." he's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she hasever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've ob tained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
U nless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember... no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone...
live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it'seasier to make 1 00,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# But you're the ke y to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# Oh, baby #
# What you've done to me #
# Done to me #
# You make me feel so good inside #
# Good inside #
# And I just wanna be #
# Wanna be #
# Close to you, you make me feel so alive #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# You make me feel #
- # You make me feel # - # You make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a real... #
# You make me feel #
# Feel like a... #
# You make me feel like a real... #
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
# What you've done to me #
# Natural woman. #
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favorite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She'sexhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good color on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking adv antage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking aboutviktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don'texist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
The y have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
Thees calating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is thiselaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I...
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I reognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just...
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Os cars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's myexit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And, the winner of Best Actress... is...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern tehnology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don'teven feel I belong in the Best Actress category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saweach other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right...
when you smile it...
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, hone y?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's noteven grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my s cript next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leavingearly.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
hi.
hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
U h... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But...
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a seret now, elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine...
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyalenough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code molded by me from a mathematicalequation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being... a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if the y still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think allelementary s chools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowdedenough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have youever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don'teat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, beause...
I've defrauded millions.
The y'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, beause... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, the y'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but the y like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phone y-balone y world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world youexisted.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that lexist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorne y.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
" Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wishi had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
H mm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfetly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what the y were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone beause there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
Even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"...
See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you couldexplain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question...
altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn'texist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
H uh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
He y, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
...that she bought for you.
I did...
I can prove...
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and dis cs.
Where are the dis cs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where the y are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's dis cs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just...
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
He y, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted reognition.
I wanted to be appreiated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defense.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny herexistence?
I can never forgive that.
Beause obviously sheexisted, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it'sembarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well... we don't want to believe daddy beause we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can beured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a ps y chiatrist in Ventura, well-respeted, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 1 0 years of abjet failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them the y can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today'sedition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, hone y.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- But thank you.
- Well, it was lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we doneenough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from theeho.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Goodevening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you'reeager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expeting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
hi.
Oh yes.
# Looking out #
# On the morning rain #
# I used to feel so inspired #
# And when I knew I had to face another day #
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #
# Before the day I met you #
# Life was so unkind #
# You're the ke y to my peace of mind #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #
# When my soul was in the lost and found #
# You came along to claim it #
# And didn't know what was wrong with me #
# Till your kiss helped me name it #
# Now I'm no longer doub tful #
# To what I'm living for #
# And if I make you happy #
# I don't need to do more #
# 'Cause you make me feel #
# You make me feel #
# You make me feel like a natural woman #

# Oh, baby, what you've done to me #
# Done to me #

She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Mr. Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
- Nicola!
- This, this...
- not this.
- Nicola!
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?
Because I made the changes, all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot?
Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth.
I swear.
It's a 50-foot Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh.
You've insulted me for the last time.
You're right.
It's actually--
It's actually taller.
- You're right.
It's amazing.
- Coffee!
Wait a minute.
The tires are over inflated.
See?
It's just this.
See?
Look.
Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.
See?
It's lower already.
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.
You know, I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture...
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
!
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
I already put out a press release citing creative differences.
So just let it go.
You went to the press?
Do we have everything?
All right.
You know what?
You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
'Cause you oughta go.
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
Creative differences?
The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look.
I've analyzed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
Viktor, according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they 'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other name is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No!
I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
I told you she was bad.
No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
Mike 'n' Ike's?
They're not just any Mike 'n' Ike's,
These are cherry Mike 'n' Ike's.
Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director--
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look, look... pockets full of these... things?
!
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card, has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike 'n' Ike's be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into
must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened;
that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room;
and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
They're mocking-- we're at their mercy.
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars, but They used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones who would tell them what to do.
And we would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
!
When the y were under contract to us, we could change their names if we wanted to.
- More than once.
- Viktor, do you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
!
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please.
Come on.
New York-
- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- H ere we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important.
I don't know.
Shine a little light in that darkened cinema.
It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything!
I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York...
It's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
!
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time's sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- H e y, Dad.
- How are you, hone y?
- Good.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Be cause it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
'Kay.
By e, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- H e y, Mom.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant won't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!
I did it!
I licked skin, I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.
I'll call security if you don't back off.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading-lady right here.
In my pants.
Pleas e, sir, I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr. Taransky, don't--
Don't you recognize me?
The Future of Film Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank.
Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.
You were booed off the stage.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight y ears ago.
And that whole time I never left my computer.
U h-huh.
Good for you, Hank.
Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
You have to see her.
Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Yeah, well, you're talking about a "syn-thespian."
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done.
With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- that's why you're so perfect.
You have something...
- that I don't have.
- What's that?
An e y e.
An e y e for performance.
You know the truth when you see it.
I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."
That changed my life.
You saw "Straw God"?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science--
We're the perfect marriage.
Hank...
I've had a rough day today.
But, I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me?
She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
Art, you don't understand.
I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky!
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr. Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
H e wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no! Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're suppose to believe that was 1 9th century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys...
Who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?
The nun?
Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.
And the rest of the film, what did you think?
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?
Well...
I saw her picture...
on the computer.
A computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
Only her brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah.
I have a feeling Mom's going to take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know.
I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingénue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why?
Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
H e y, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.
Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of well, Grace Kelly-- ha-ha-- and the face... of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out,
- just like you said.
- Very good.
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms. Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitized.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep.
And a little more...
Bacall.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
How do I look?
Give me Audrey.
How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'm going tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't I?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing,
his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see.
See be yond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favour of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine,
it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's real anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
It's a grey area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
"To Whom it May Concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews, or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone."
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
!
Where did you find her?
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today--
"Eternity Forever."
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine y ears ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding Hank?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank?
Are They involved?
They were at one time inseparable.
Yes.
And now?
Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
We gave you a complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.
Thank you.
- Viktor, he y.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry.
Nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I, we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't--
Look, I have not read "Eternity Forever,"
but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive.
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
Look, I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
- She's bus y right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
Well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
Anything you can do.
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, hone y.
What is this, some kind of jamming device?
This is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Hone y, I know you want to do charity work.
No, They've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would They do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah.
Very.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do?
Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know you're not talking to some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
And Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.
I mean, you look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss
"Eternity Forever."
I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself, you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- U h-huh.
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.
- Theatre training.
- Oh, she was in the theatre?
Where?
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe.
Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce.
She is so disciplined.
Well, we've gotta do something about this- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.
- Does all her own stunts.
- even the fall from the plane?
- even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.
Shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, Studio Head, but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.
But you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, Director, but as Viktor, your first former husband,
what happened to you?
H uh?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky.
I know that it looked like I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I understand.
- Are They--
- They're all here.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Viktor.
I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for "Eternity Forever."
A reminder:
as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason, whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac.
I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris.
You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlitt.
We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when They're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say,
Except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together.
Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone.
Simone.
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, They're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Now, why do you have to bring that up?
!
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about... you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, They're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.
Now, Ms. Enomis demands her privacy.
So, you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone, will escort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
Who is it?
It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're all right now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith.
Thank God for you.
This is way above and be yond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
You know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the s cent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like...
um, like her?
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone?
What?
What did you say?
I said do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me Simone!
Simone?
Yes.
Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Excuse me just a minute.
Is something wrong?
Well, actually, maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you bus y tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the Presidential Suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir.
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture--
The picture.
It's a revelation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor!
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
Jesus.
That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's, uh...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
!
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
I'm your biggest fan!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
!
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
We have our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Get better people!
What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes; every concierge, every maitre d', They're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
N ever stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
!
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once.
But then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman.
A tell-all story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mr. Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
!
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.
What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever."
They're in the toilet.
She's gotta get out there and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.
If you can't handle her, I will.
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 4 2 of "Good for Nothing."
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.
- Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No!
No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,
- girl-to-girl.
Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this are we?
What is all this?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere,
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights--
- Name it.
- This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
We can work with that.
I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
Thank you.
Give her our best.
That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you--
No, no.
Don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She, uh... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well.
All right.
Good.
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna-
- By e.
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live--
Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stay ed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am,
They're two totally different people.
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in is that They're not about special effects.
And They are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could They have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone!
Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes.
Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
N ice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do, 'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot for the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh...
And for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in a trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I gotta tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record.
I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do?
Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
All right.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr. Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I gotta ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.
Excellent.
H ere, Simone wanted you to have these.
- Unreal.
- And remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
Let's get you into hair and make-up.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 1 00,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only, Simone!
I love you...
LA.
It's great to be here.
Looking out
On the morning rain
I used to feel so inspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Oh, baby
What you've done to me
Done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I just wanna be
Wanna be
Close to you, you make me feel so alive
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
- You make me feel
- You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a real...
You make me feel
Feel like a...
You make me feel like a real...
Thank you.
N ever stop believing.
Yeah!
Simone!
What you've done to me
Natural woman.
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favourite girls in all the world.
We just stopped by to congratulate Simone.
Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good colour on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and mom, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, I know, but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult, I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- Oh my God.
Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,
But I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh?
No.
Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognize the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa.
God!
Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful.
I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
Could you go to the Os cars with him?
No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay.
Okay.
For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes.
By e.
- By e!
Goodbye.
Oh! And, the winner of Best Actress... I s...
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
Thank you.
...and Simone for "Eternity Forever."
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the Best Actress category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always, I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course, I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky ,
Are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on "Sunrise."
Oh, that's okay.
I know.
I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think I won't call out?
Do you think I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right-- when you smile it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes... that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in "Eternity Forever."
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
H ere.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why?
Why, hone y?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this, clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Gotta go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighbourhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
U h... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay.
I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait!
Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh.
That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that, make that kind of sacrifice.
- No.
No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- but--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
For some reason, I can't betray Simone.
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning you would go back to her.
- No.
No.
- You would, Viktor.
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows?
I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code moulded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There's no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
!
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge, I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes! Had a rough night? Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me.
I made you first.
Well, we're back on "Good Morning, Good Day,"
and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration?
God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel.
everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean, you know, make some confession, because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight,
They'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career, but They like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie.
So, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
H ere I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
but what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human.
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr. Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
" Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."
It was so strange.
H e actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
H e was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop it.
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood...
All fake?
H mm?
This is fake.
This is fake.
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So, I will confess to fraud but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No.
No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what They were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right.
Exactly .
- And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about, the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead, now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no.
No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look.
even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's "Sim One"-
- See?
"Simulation One"!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr. Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor.
I know.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Why don't you just come clean?
Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
H e y, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
- ...that she bought for you.
I did-- I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here.
Here.
Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's just go.
I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs?
You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where They are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
Just--
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
H e y, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood.
You killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard, I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard, I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated.
So I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defence.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."
Viktor!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But, to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah, Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No.
No.
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
Well-- we don't want to believe daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mom.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What's that?
One part of Dad's story may have been true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity
due to the trauma of your divorce, 1 0 y ears of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No.
No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them They can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.
I bludgeoned her!
I set her on fire and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news:
International media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of "The LA Times."
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, hone y.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now.
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
What do you think, Lainey?
About you and Mom?
Well, about me and Simone.
What I did.
everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake.
As long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No.
It's life.
H e y, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.
How are you?
Max Sayer from the echo.
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call.
Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... why?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish-bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media, with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
Looking out
On the morning rain
I used to feel so inspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
And didn't know what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
To what I'm living for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
Done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I just wanna be
Wanna be
Close to you, you make me feel so alive
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a real...
You make me feel
Feel like a real...
You make me feel like a real...
She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
MR. TARANSKY...?
SHE'S...
SHE'S WALKING?
DON'T TELL ME SHE'S WALKING.
SHE CAN'T WALK.
-NICOLA!
- THIS, THIS...
- NOT THIS.
-NICOLA!
- HOW WAS YOUR MASSAGE?
- YOU'RE IN BREACH.
- CIGARETTE.
- IS THIS ABOUT THE NEW PAGES?
BECAUSE I MADE THE CHANGES,
ALL THE CHANGES YOU WANTED.
YOU ARE VIRTUALLY IN EVERY SCENE.
IT IS NOT THE SIZE OF THE ROLE, VIKTOR.
AM I, OR AM I NOT ENTITLED
TO THE BIGGEST TRAILER ON THE LOT?
HMM?
IT'S THE BIGGEST ON EARTH.
I SWEAR.
IT'S A 50-FOOT AIRSTREAM.
THEY DON'T MAKE THEM ANY LONGER.
- TALLER, VIKTOR.
- TALLER?
- TALLER!
- WHAT?
EH.
- YOU'VE INSULTED ME FOR THE LAST TIME.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S ACTUALLY...
IT'S ACTUALLY TALLER.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S AMAZING.
- COFFEE!
WAIT A MINUTE.
THE TIRES ARE OVER INFLATED.
SEE?
IT'S JUST THIS.
- SEE?
LOOK.
HERE.
- ( air hisses )
- THE AIR COMES RIGHT OUT.
- THIS IS SAD.
SEE, IT'S LOWER ALREADY.
NICOLA, I BEG YOU.
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.
YOU KNOW, I HAD THREE OTHER OFFERS.
I ONLY SIGNED ON TO THIS PICTURE
- OUT OF LOYALTY.
- WELL, THEN SHOW ME SOME.
THEY'RE GOING TO SHUT ME DOWN!
IT'S NOT WORKING, VIKTOR.
I MEAN, MY GOD!
THE SCENE WITH THE THOUSAND GEESE?
!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS FILM!
NOBODY IS GOING TO UNDERSTAND THIS FILM.
LOOK, I ALREADY PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE CITING CREATIVE DIFFERENCES.
SO JUST LET IT GO.
YOU WENT TO THE PRESS?
DO WE HAVE EVERYTHING?
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU ARE RIGHT.
AND WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
- THANK YOU.
- LET ME HELP YOU WITH THESE.
'CAUSE YOU OUGHTA GO.
- I DON'T DESERVE YOU.
- OH.
THIS FILM DOESN'T DESERVE YOU.
IT DESERVES MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN YOU!
CREATIVE DIFFERENCES?
THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU'RE NOT CREATIVE.
TO HELL, PLEASE.
Woman:
Jack?
Jack, are you there?
SHE'S GOOD.
YOU CAN HARDLY TELL SHE'S READING OFF A TELEPROMPTER.
Jack:
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
LOOK.
I'VE ANALYZED THIS FOOTAGE.
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED IN THE CAN ALREADY.
IF I COULD JUST MAKE THE PROPER ADJUSTMENTS,
WE CAN FINISH THIS FILM WITHOUT HER.
ACCORDING TO THE WRIT HER ATTORNEYS FILED AT NOON TODAY,
THEY'LL SUE IF THE FILM IS RELEASED WITH NICOLA IN A SINGLE FRAME.
THEY WILL SUE, VIKTOR.
THEY'RE SERIOUS.
SO LET'S RECAST.
NICOLA ANDERS IS THE ONLY ACTRESS IN THE WORLD
THAT COULD PLAY THAT PART.
- IT'S A REMAKE, HAL.
-THAT'S RIGHT.
NICOLA ANDERS IS NOT BIGGER THAN THIS PICTURE.
Woman:
OF COURSE SHE IS, VIKTOR.
NO OTHER NAME IS GOING TO SIGN ON NOW.
WHO NEEDS A NAME?
WE'LL CAST AN UNKNOWN.
I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY OPPOSITE AN UNKNOWN.
- WE CAN'T SELL AN UNKNOWN
- THE NUMBERS DON'T WORK.
IF WE EVER WANT TO BE IN THE NICOLA ANDERS BUSINESS AGAIN,
WE HAVE TO CUT OUR LOSSES AND SHELVE THE PICTURE.
NO!
I WILL NOT GIVE IN TO THAT BLACKMAILING--
VIKTOR, LET'S TAKE A WALK.
Woman:
RIDICULOUS PERFORMANCE.
VIKTOR:
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS BAD.
NO, YOURS IN THERE.
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE THINGS
SO DIFFICULT FOR YOURSELF?
DIFFICULT?
I'M BEING DIFFICULT?
YES.
MM-HMM.
ELAINE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE?
-"MIKE 'N' IKE'S"?
- NO, THESE AREN'TANY "MIKE 'N' IKE'S,"
THESE ARECHERRY "MIKE 'N' IKE'S."
DO YOU KNOW WHY I, VIKTOR TARANSKY,
TWO-TIME ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATED DIRECTOR--
VIKTOR, THAT WAS SHORT SUBJECT.
--OVERSEEING THE MOST CHERISHED MOVIE PROJECT
OF MY ENTIRE CAREER, AM WALKING AROUND WITH-- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK...
POCKETS FULL OF THESETHINGS?
!
- I HAVE A FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME.
- I'M GOING TO TELL YOU.
BECAUSE MS. NICOLA ANDERS,
SUPERMODEL WITH A S.A.G. CARD,
HAS IT WRITTEN IN HER CONTRACT
THAT ALL CHERRY "MIKE 'N' IKE'S"
BE REMOVED FROM HER CANDY DISH,
ALONG WITH STRICT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ANY ROOM SHE WALKS INTO
MUST HAVE SEVEN PACKS OF CIGARETTES WAITING FOR HER--
THREE OF THEM OPENED;
THAT THERE BE A PERSONAL JACUZZI
WITHIN 80 PACES OF HER DRESSING ROOM;
AND THAT ANY TIME SHE TRAVELS,
HER NANNY MUST FLY WITH HER FIRST-CLASS.
SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
ELAINE, SHE DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN.
DON'T YOU SEE?
THEY'RE MOCKING US.
THEY'RE MOCKING-- WE'RE AT THEIR MERCY.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I MEAN, WE ALWAYS HAD MOVIE STARS,
BUT THEY USED TO BE OUR STARS, REMEMBER?
WE WERE THE ONES WHO WOULD TELL THEM WHAT TO DO.
AND WE WOULD TELL THEM WHAT TO WEAR,
- WHO TO DATE--
- THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT?
!
WHEN THEY WERE UNDER CONTRACT TO US,
WE COULD CHANGE THEIR NAMES IF WE WANTED TO.
- MORE THAN ONCE.
- VIKTOR,
DO YOU REALIZE YOU'RE NOSTALGIC
FOR AN ERA YOU WEREN'T EVEN BORN IN?
!
I DO REMEMBER WHY I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS.
- YOU SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN.
-OH, PLEASE.
COME ON.
NEW YORK-
- CASSAVETES.
REMEMBER?
- HERE WE GO.
- WHAT WERE WE DOING?
WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
I DON'T KNOW.
- SHINE A LITTLE LIGHT IN THAT DARKENED CINEMA.
- IT'S CALLED A PROJECTOR.
ILLUMINATE HEARTS AND MINDS WITH A RAY OF TRUTH.
-OKAY.
- I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT WE WERE DOING.
I HAVE GOOD MEMORIES OF THOSE DAYS, TOO.
I DO, BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT THAT--
OR YOU, OR ME,
OR SOME HIGH-MINDED IDEAL.
THIS IS BUSINESS.
- SPARE ME.
- LOOK AROUND.
WHO DO YOU THINK PAYS FOR ALL OF THIS?
THIS IS ABOUT INVESTME NT AND RETURN.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN INVESTMENT AND RETURN!
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WHO PAYS FOR ANYTHING!
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A MOVIE!
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS, VIKTOR.
THOSE DAYS IN NEW YORK...
IT'S OVER, VIKTOR.
YOU'RE NOT RENEWING MY CONTRACT?
HOW CAN I?
!
YOUR LAST THREE PICTURES TANKED.
NO BANKABLE STAR IS GOING TO WORK WITH YOU AFTER THIS.
I MEAN, IF YOU JUST COMPROMISED A LITTLE.
WELL, NOT EVERY DAY YOU'RE FIRED
BY THE MOTHER OF YOUR OWN CHILD.
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT I KEPT YOU ON
AFTER THE DIVORCE FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.
AND SO YOU COULD STILL HOLD YOUR HEAD UP IN FRONT OF LAINEY.
- I FOUGHT FOR YOU.
- YEAH, WELL...
I'M SORRY, VIKTOR.
DAD!
- SWEETHEART.
- HEY, DAD.
- HOW ARE YOU, HONEY?
- GOOD.
I'M SORRY MOM CANNED YOU.
Viktor:
I'M GOING TO FINISH THIS PICTURE.
LAINEY, I'M GOING TO FINISH IT.
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT.
I KNOW YOU WILL, DAD.
YOU'RE VIKTOR TARANSKY.
I'M VIKTOR TARANSKY.
'KAY.
BYE, DAD.
- HI, SWEETHEART.
- HEY, MOM.
Elaine:
ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M VIKTOR TARANSKY.
MR. TARANSKY?
MR. TARANSKY, THANK GOD.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SEE YOU.
I'VE BEEN CALLING.
( panting )
YOUR ASSISTANT WON'T PUT ME THROUGH.
I TOLD HER IT WAS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.
I WAS AFRAID I WASN'T GOING TO GET TO YOU IN TIME.
PLEASE, JUST...
- KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.
- I DID IT!
I DID IT!
I LICKED SKIN, I LICKED HAIR,
- I LICKED EVERY PART OF HER
- I'M GOING TO CALL SECURITY.
I'LL CALL SECURITY IF YOU DON'T BACK OFF.
I HAVE HER, MR. TARANSKY.
THE ANSWER TO YOUR PRAYERS.
- THE ANSWER TO THIS.
-I WAS MISQUOTED.
I HAVE YOUR NEW LEADING LADY RIGHT HERE.
IN MY PANTS.
PLEASE, SIR, I DON'T KNOW YOU.
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM--
- IT'S ME!
MR. TARANSKY, DON'T--
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?
THE FUTURE OF FILM CONFERENCE IN SAN JOSE.
REMEMBER THAT?
HANK.
HANK ALENO.
I WAS A KEY SPEAKER.
YOU MUST REMEMBER MY SPEECH.
- "WHO NEEDS HUMANS?"
- RIGHT.
YOU WERE BOOED OFF THE STAGE.
- WHOA, THAT'S GOT TO BE..
- EIGHT YEARS AGO.
AND THAT WHOLE TIME I NEVER LEFT MY COMPUTER.
UH-HUH.
GOOD FOR YOU, HANK.
WELL, IT'S GOOD AND BAD.
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THIS.
THE EYE TUMOR.
- MICROWAVES FROM THE SCREEN.
- I'M SORRY.
DON'T BE, BECAUSE IT WAS WORTH IT.
YOU HAVE TO SEE HER.
OH, I'VE SEEN THOSE.
- NOT LIKE THIS.
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A "SYN-THESPIAN."
- A VIRTUAL ACTOR.
- NO, WE CALL THEM "VAC-TORS."
"VAC-TORS"?
I NEED FLESH.
- FLESH IS WEAK.
- IT CAN'T BE DONE.
IT CAN BE DONE.
WITH MY NEW COMPUTER CODE,
IT CAN BE DONE.
YOU AND ME...
- WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER.
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS.
SEE, THAT'S WHY-- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SO PERFECT.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING...
- THAT I DON'T HAVE.
- WHAT'S THAT?
AN EYE.
AN EYE FOR PERFORMANCE.
YOU KNOW THE TRUTH WHEN YOU SEE IT.
I KNOW.
I MEAN, I'VE SEEN YOUR MOVIES.
I LOVE YOUR MOVIES.
- YOU LOVE MY MOVIES?
- "STRAW GOD."
THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.
YOU SAW "STRAW GOD"?
I HAVE SEEN EVER FRAME OF YOUR WORK.
YOU'RE THE ONLY FILMMAKER
WITH THE ARTISTIC INTEGRITY...
TO REALIZE MY VISION.
YOU AND ME, ART AND SCIENCE--
WE'RE THE PERFECT MARRIAGE.
HANK...
I'VE HAD A ROUGH DAY TODAY.
BUT, I TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL CALL YOU ABOUT THIS NEXT WEEK.
- WE CAN TALK.
- I WON'T BE HERE IN A WEEK.
- THE TUMOR IS INOPERABLE.
- I'LL CALL YOU ABOUT IT, OKAY?
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.
THE TUMOR IS INOPERABLE.
I'LL BE DEAD.
WELL, I'M ALREADY DEAD.
CALL ME!
THIS WEEK!
PLEASE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE WON'T WORK WITH ME?
SHE'S DONE NOTHING.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A SINGLE CREDIT TO HER NAME.
Man:
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
ART, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'VE MORTGAGED EVERYTHING TO FINISH THIS FILM.
THE CREDITORS ARE CALLING ME.
THEY'RE AT THE DOOR FOR GOD'S SAKE.
-( dial tone )
- HELLO?
DAMN IT!
MR. TARANSKY.
MR. TARANSKY!
-MR.
TARANSKY!
- NO, I'M NOT HIM!
- MR. TARANSKY!
- I'M NOT HIM!
HANK ALENO!
I REPRESENT THE ESTATE OF MR. HANK ALENO.
IT WAS HIS LAST WISH THAT YOU HAVE THIS.
WHAT IS IT?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
HE WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT.
( harmonic vocals )
Hal:
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
Valarie:
From Valarie.
( gunshot )
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
Why are we here?
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No why... just here.
Just here.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,
I KNOW I MAY BE GUILTY OF A CRIME,
BUT IT WAS COMMITTED WITH THE PUREST OF INTENTIONS.
I WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE
TO THE ACTING COMMUNITY
WHO...
PUT THEMSELVES ABOVE THE WORK,
- WHO PUT THEMSELVES ABOVE ME.
-( door opens )
SO, WHAT DID YOU GUYS THINK?
- ( laughter )
- SO FAKE.
TOTALLY ARTIFICIAL.
LIKE WE'RE SUPPOSE TO BELIEVE THAT WAS 19th CENTURY LISBON.
- COME ON.
- GUYS...
WHO'S LOOKING AT THE SETS WHEN SHE'S ON SCREEN?
( together ) OH, YEAH.
( chattering )
THERE HE IS.
THAT'S MY DAD, VIKTOR TARANSKY.
( applause )
- SHE WAS MAGNIFICENT.
- SHE'S ABSOLUTELY UNREAL.
Woman:
BREATHTAKING.
SHE WASN'T TOO...
CARTOONY, OR ANYTHING?
- WHO, THE NUN?
- OR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE MOTHER?
A STAR LIKE THAT, WHO CARES ABOUT THE SUPPORTING CAST?
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN.
SHE'S NOT OF THIS EARTH.
- YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD
- OH, NOT OF THIS EARTH.
( chattering )
- AND THE REST OF THE FILM WHAT DID YOU THINK?
- SHE'S A MIRACLE.
- WHERE DID YOU FIND HER?
- WELL...
I SAW HER PICTURE.
.. ON THE COMPUTER.
A COMPUTER?
YOU REALLY DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT HER?
ONLY HER BRILLIANCE.
TO BE HONEST,
WITH WHAT YOU HAD TO WORK WITH,
I WAS EXPECTING A TRAIN WRECK.
- YOU REALLY PULLED IT OFF.
- I DID?
YEAH.
I HAVE A FEELING MOM'S GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK AFTER THIS.
BACK ON THE LOT.
THAT'S WHAT--
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
COME ON, LET'S GO.
Newscaster:
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film "Sunrise, Sunset."
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
TARANSKY.
( applause )
SIMONE!
SIMONE?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO, ELAINE.
- WHERE IS SHE?
- SHE'S NOT HERE.
- WHY ISN'T SHE WITH YOU?
WHY?
BECAUSE SHE WOULD NEVER COME TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
SHE'S INTENSELY PRIVATE.
BACK TO WORK, EVERYONE.
SHE'S NOT HERE.
HEY, LISTEN.
HAVE YOU READ THE REVIEWS?
THEY'RE LOVE LETTERS.
LISTEN TO THIS ONE.
OH, HERE.
SIMONE HAS THE VOICE OF A YOUNG JANE FONDA,
THE BODY OF SOPHIA LOREN,
THE GRACE OF WELL, GRACE KELLY,
HA-HA.
AND THE FACE...
OF AUDREY HEPBURN COMBINED WITH AN ANGEL.
- ALMOST RIGHT.
- I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HER.
OH, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
WHY NOT?
SHE IS SOMEWHAT OF A RECLUSE.
THAT'S HOW SHE STAYS SO PURE.
SHE ISOLATES HERSELF IN HER ART.
VIKTOR, IT'S MY STUDIO.
ELAINE, IT'S MY ACTOR.
THERE ARE OTHER STUDIOS.
THERE'S ONLY ONE SIMONE.
OKAY, HAVE IT YOUR WAY, VIKTOR.
HELLO, WALTER.
NOBODY CAME IN OR WENT OUT,
- JUST LIKE YOU SAID.
- VERY GOOD.
- MR. TARANSKY?
- YES?
IS MS. SIMONE COMING IN TODAY?
SHE'S ALREADY HERE.
SHE ARRIVED BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.
SHE'S GOING TO LEAVE LONG AFTER YOU'RE GONE.
REMEMBER, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
ARE YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE EVER TO ENTER THIS SET
WITHOUT MY EXPRESS PERMISSION, UNDERSTOOD?
YES, SIR.
MR. TARANSKY?
WHAT IF IT CATCHES ON FIRE?
LET IT BURN.
( door buzzes )
GOOD MORNING, SIMONE.
Simone's voice:
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
SIMONE, A STAR IS...
DIGITIZED.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
WE HAVE STEPPED INTO A NEW DIMENSION.
OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE FRAUD
NOW EXCEEDS OUR ABILITY TO DETECT IT.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
TOO MUCH MERYL STREEP.
A LITTLE LESS STREEP.
AND A LITTLE MORE...
BACALL.
Is this better, Mr. Taransky?
MUCH.
WHILE WE'RE AT IT,
THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
I WANT TO ADD TO YOUR REPERTOIRE.
Audrey Hepburn:
...THE WRONG HOLLY GOLIGHTLY.
REMEMBER THAT THING AUDREY HEPBURN DOES
IN "BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S"?
How do I look?
GIVE ME AUDREY.
How do I look?
PERFECT.
PERFECT, SIMONE.
PERFECT.
OH, GOD.
I'M SO RELAXED AROUND YOU.
I'M SO MYSELF.
You did create me.
I JUST BROUGHT SOMEONE ELSE'S DREAM TO LIFE.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
WELL...
THAT'S TRUE.
I DON'T WANT TO BOAST, BUT...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
I'M GOING TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU.
WHY WOULDN'T I?
OF COURSE...
WITH HANK'S TRAGIC PASSING,
HIS SECRET DID DIE WITH HIM.
THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF
TECHNOLOGY IN SEARCH OF AN ARTIST.
SOMEONE WITH INTEGRITY,
SOMEONE WITH VISION, SOMEONE WHO CAN SEE.
SEE BEYOND THIS IRRATIONAL
ALLEGIANCE TO FLESH AND BLOOD.
SOMEONE WHO CAN SEE
THAT WITH THE RISE IN THE PRICE OF A REAL ACTOR
AND THE FALL IN THE PRICE OF A FAKE,
THAT THE SCALES HAVE TIPPED--
NATURALLY IN FAVOR OF THE FAKE.
SOMEONE WHO CAN SEE
THAT IF A PERFORMANCE IS GENUINE,
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE ACTOR'S REAL OR NOT.
AND WHAT'S REAL ANYMORE?
MOST ACTORS THESE DAYS
HAVE DIGITAL WORK DONE TO THEM.
THERE'S A GRAY AREA.
THE ONLY REAL TRUTH IS THE WORK.
I'M GOING TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU
AFTER YOUR NEXT PICTURE.
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'RE TOO BEAUTIFUL.
WE'RE GOING TO FIX THAT.
( chattering )
- IS THIS ON?
- ( feedback )
I WILL NOT BE TAKING ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING SIMONE.
I DO, HOWEVER, HAVE A STATEMENT
TO READ ON HER BEHALF.
"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY
PUBLIC RESPONSE TO MR. TARANSKY'S FILM.
AT THIS TIME I WILL BE CONDUCTING NO INTERVIEWS,
OR MAKING PUBLICITY APPEARANCES--
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
- I POLITELY REQUEST THAT THE PRESS
RESPECT MY PRIVACY AND LET THE WORK SPEAK FOR ITSELF.
YOURS TRULY, SIMONE."
VIKTOR!
WHO IS SIMONE DATING?
!
WHERE DID YOU FIND HER?
- IS SIMONE HER REAL NAME?
- DIDN'T I MAKE IT CLEAR?
NO QUESTIONS REGARDING SIMONE.
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET SOME ANSWERS.
I WILL MAKE MY FINAL STATEMENT.
MS. SIMONE BEGINS PRODUCTION ON HER NEW FILM TODAY--
"ETERNITY FOREVER."
THIS IS A PROJECT WHICH HAS BEEN NEAR AND DEAR
TO MY HEART SINCE I WROTE IT
NINE YEARS AGO.
THANK YOU.
WOULD YOU ANSWER A QUESTION REGARDING HANK?
HANK?
WHO ASKED ME ABOUT HANK?
FUNNY, WHY IS THE MOVIE DEDICATED TO HANK?
ARE THEY INVOLVED?
THEY WERE AT ONE TIME INSEPARABLE.
YES.
AND NOW?
NOW...
SADLY TO SAY, ONLY IN SPIRIT.
THANK YOU.
YOUR CAR WILL BE READY IN JUST A MINUTE.
WE GAVE YOU A COMPLIMENTARY CAR WASH.
- OH, REALLY?
- THEY'RE CLEANING THE ENGINE NOW.
THANK YOU.
- VIKTOR, HEY.
- HAL.
I AM SO HAPPY FOR US.
THE FILM, THE CHEMISTRY.
NOTHING AGAINST NICOLA ANDERS,
BUT I THINK THAT SIMONE AND I,
WE REALLY WORKED GREAT TOGETHER.
- YOU WERE NEVER TOGETHER.
- STILL, THE CONNECTION WAS UNDENIABLE.
YOU CAN'T--
LOOK, I HAVE NOT READ "ETERNITY FOREVER,"
BUT IT IS FANTASTIC.
AND I KNOW I WOULD BE PERFECT FOR THE PART OF CLIVE.
- CLYDE.
- CLYDE, RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
YES, PERFECT.
COME ON, MAN.
LOOK, I RAN INTO SIMONE ON THE LOT.
- REALLY?
- YES, REALLY.
- SHE NEVER MENTIONED IT.
- SHE'S BUSY RIGHT NOW.
PEOPLE COMING AT HER FROM ALL ANGLES.
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW, HUH?
( forced laughter )
I STRONGLY SENSED
THAT SHE THOUGHT I WOULD BE PERFECT FOR CLYDE AS WELL.
- REALLY?
- STRONGLY.
-( ringing )
- EXCUSE ME.
SURE.
HELLO?
SIMONE, IT'S SO GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU.
HOW ARE YOU, SWEETHEART?
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO I'M WITH.
- YOU MET HIM ON THE LOT THE OTHER DAY
- IT WAS MORE IN PASSING.
No, you're not even close.
Hal.
-Hal Sinclair.
- WHAT'S WRONG NOW?
I'M GETTING NOTHING FROM HER SIDE OF THE CONVERSATION.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Anyway, listen.
Do you think he'd be right for "Eternity Forever"?
HE'S NOT THE RIGHT TYPE?
YOU WANT TO GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION?
WELL...
WE'LL TRY AND TALK HER INTO IT, DON'T WORRY.
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO.
- ANYTHING.
- YEAH, LISTEN, HONEY.
- WHAT IS THIS, SOME KIND OF JAMMING DEVICE?
-This is a bad place to talk.
- MAYBE HE'S JUST TALKING TO HIMSELF.
- ( scoffs )
TARANSKY'S NOT THAT GOOD AN ACTOR.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work.
NO, THEY'VE TAKEN SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS.
SOME KIND OF NEW ENCRYPTION.
Man:
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS...
IT'S DARK.
DARK?
YEAH.
VERY.
All right, we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend.
- CAN YOU EVER STOP DOING THAT?
- WHY?
YOU'LL LOSE YOURSELF IN THAT THING.
YOU GOTTA GET OUT MORE.
HOW YOU GONNA MEET BOYS?
DAD, I KNOW PLENTY OF BOYS.
YOU DO?
WHO?
WHERE DO YOU MEET THEM?
YOU MEET THEM IN THOSE CHAT ROOMS?
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO SOME MIDDLE-AGED FREAK?
DAD, I CAN SPOT A MIDDLE-AGED FREAK A MILE AWAY.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL TODAY.
LET'S GO OUTSIDE AND EAT.
YOUNG LAINEY, LEAVE THE COMPUTER, PLEASE.
OKAY.
( yelling, camera shutters clicking )
DAD, IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO EAT INSIDE.
STAY HERE.
Viktor:
WHAT IS THIS?
( cameras clicking )
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-YOU'RE TRESPASSING.
- YOU CAN'T HIDE HER FOREVER!
- SIMONE APPEARS ONLY WHEN I WANT HER TO APPEAR!
- SOUNDS LIKE A PRISONER.
- WHAT ARE YOU, HOLDING HER HOSTAGE?
- YOU'RE THE HOSTAGE.
I MEAN, YOU LOOK KIND OF CAPTIVE TO ME.
LAINEY, DON'T YOU EVER WONDER
WHERE I'M REALLY HIDING SIMONE?
Lainey:
JUST AS LONG AS I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE, DAD.
- BYE, DAD.
- BYE, HONEY.
HELLO, VIKTOR.
SORRY I GOT HER BACK LATE.
OH, NO PROBLEM.
HEY, YOU WANT TO COME IN?
- HI.
- HI, HONEY.
- HI, VIK.
- KENT.
VIKTOR, WE SIMPLY HAVE TO DISCUSS
"ETERNITY FOREVER."
I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED SIMONE'S SCRIPT NOTES.
THERE AREN'T ANY.
IF THE FILMMAKERS ARE HAPPY,
SHE'S HAPPY.
SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF, YOU KNOW, AN INSTRUMENT.
SO SHE'S REALLY GOING TO DO ALL THIS NUDITY?
IT'S ON THE PAGE.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BUDGET.
IT'S COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC.
YOU ALLOWED NOTHING FOR LIMOUSINE SERVICE.
- SHE DRIVES HERSELF.
- UH-HUH.
-HAIR AND MAKEUP?
- DOES HER OWN.
- IN HER THEATER TRAINING.
- OH, SHE WAS IN THE THEATER?
- WHERE?
- YOU WANT HER RESUME?
I'LL SEND IT TO YOU.
OKAY, GREAT.
THANKS.
AT LEAST, VIKTOR, CONTINGENCY FOR WARDROBE.
ANYBODY CAN GO UP A SIZE.
I GUARANTEE SHE WILL NOT GAIN AN OUNCE.
SHE IS SO DISCIPLINED.
WELL, WE'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS- "STUNTWOMAN."
- WHAT ABOUT IT?
- WELL, THERE ISN'T ONE.
- SHE DOESN'T NEED ONE.
- DOES ALL HER OWN STUNTS.
- EVEN THE FALL FROM THE PLANE?
- EVEN THE FALL FROM THE PLANE.
- OH.
SHOOT IT ON THE LAST DAY.
LISTEN, VIKTOR.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU NOW, NOT AS ELAINE, STUDIO HEAD,
BUT AS ELAINE, EX-WIFE.
HEY, SECOND EX-WIFE.
SERIOUSLY.
YOU GOT LUCKY THIS LAST TIME.
BUT YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.
WE BOTH KNOW YOU WOULDN'T BE MAKING THIS OVERBLOWN ART FILM
IF YOU HADN'T CONVINCED SIMONE TO BE IN IT.
ELAINE...
TALKING TO YOU NOW, NOT AS VIKTOR, DIRECTOR,
BUT AS VIKTOR, YOUR FIRST FORMER HUSBAND,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
HUH?
EXPERIENCE, VIKTOR.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.
YEAH, I'VE SEEN THIS A HUNDRED TIMES.
- REALLY?
- YEAH.
THESE YOUNG STARS DESTROYING
THE VERY PEOPLE WHO DISCOVERED THEM.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU, THAT'S ALL.
THIS WOMAN, SHE CONTROLS YOUR DESTINY.
SHE DOESN'T CONTROL MY DESTINY.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HER I DON'T TRUST.
HI, JANE.
THANKS FOR TAKING ME BACK, MR. TARANSKY.
I KNOW THAT IT LOOKED LIKE I SIDED WITH THE STUDIO,
BUT I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN YOU.
HONESTLY.
DON'T WORRY.
I UNDERSTAND.
- ARE THEY--
-THEY'RE ALL HERE.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
HELLO.
( together ) VIKTOR.
I JUST WANT TO SAY I AM DELIGHTED
TO HAVE SUCH A WONDERFUL CAST
ASSEMBLED HERE FOR "ETERNITY FOREVER."
A REMINDER:
AS A CONDITION FOR WORKING ON THIS PICTURE,
YOU WILL NOT BE REHEARSING WITH SIMONE.
YOU WILL NOT BE SHOOTING WITH SIMONE.
ACTUALLY, YOU ARE FORBIDDEN FROM CONTACTING SIMONE
AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY REASON, WHATSOEVER.
-WORKS FOR ME.
- HOW WILL YOU SHOOT OUR LOVE SCENES?
- BODY DOUBLE.
- FOR HER?
FOR YOU.
ANYWAY, SIMONE INSISTED ON SPEAKING WITH YOU HERSELF
BEFORE FILMING STARTED.
I BELIEVE SHE'S ON THE LINE NOW.
SIMONE, ARE YOU THERE?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
( laughter )
SO ARE WE, SIMONE.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
ABSOLUTELY.
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.
Hi, who's there?
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'M MAC.
I TURNED DOWN A BERTOLUCCI FILM TO BE HERE.
HI, SIMONE.
I'M COREL.
HI, I'M CLARIS.
YOU USED TO DATE MY COUSIN, DELL.
I'M HEWLITT.
WE CAN REHEARSE IN PRIVATE IF YOU LIKE.
MY NAME IS LOTUS.
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M TALKING TO YOU.
WE ARE GOING TO BECOME SUCH GREAT FRIENDS.
HI, SIMONE, IT'S HAL.
IT'S GREAT TO BE WORKING TOGETHER...
AGAIN.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know, I'm Simone.
Hal:
Who else?
Simone's voice:
I just want to start by apologizing for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work, but I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
OH, OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.
I don't have much to say, except, that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr. Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
TOGETHER.
ABSOLUTELY.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love--
Viktor:
STILL TOO BIG.
I LIKE IT, BUT IT'S TOO BIG.
ALL RIGHT.
SMALLER TEARDROPS THIS TIME.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
PERFECT.
PERFECT.
SIMONE.
SIMONE.
SIMONE.
GONNA BE A LITTLE CHANGE IN PLANS, SIMONE.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE EFFECT
YOUR PERFORMANCE IS HAVING ON PEOPLE.
WE CAN'T STOP NOW.
THESE FILMS, THEY'RE SPEAKING
TO THE HUMAN CONDITION.
WE'RE CHANGING LIVES.
PEOPLE NEED TO BELIEVE YOU'RE REAL.
TO REVEAL THE TRUTH NOW,
IT WOULD BE TOO CRUEL.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
NOW, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT UP?
!
I MEAN, EVERYTHING'S A RISK.
BUT IT'S WORTH IT, ISN'T IT?
WE'VE DONE ENOUGH WORK TODAY.
YOU'VE BEEN COOPED UP IN THERE TOO LONG.
SO HOW ABOUT...
YOU AND I GOING OUT ON THE TOWN?
TONIGHT, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE YOU
WITH THEIR OWN EYES.
EXCUSE ME.
I WILL BE CHECKING IN A VERY SPECIAL GUEST.
- A MS. ENOMIS.
- AH, MS. ENOMIS.
NOW, MS. ENOMIS DEMANDS HER PRIVACY.
SO, YOU WILL SWITCH OFF ALL SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.
I ALONE, WILL ESCORT MS. ENOMIS TO HER ROOM
VIA THE REAR EXIT.
SHE MUST NOT BE DISTURBE D AT ANY TIME,
FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER.
I'M SURE I CAN RELY ON YOUR DISCRETION.
UNDERSTOOD, SIR.
THANK YOU.
Photographer:
THERE SHE IS!
( camera shutters clicking )
( knocking )
WHO IS IT?
IT'S SIMONE.
( yelling )
( chattering )
OKAY, I THINK EVERYBODY'S HERE.
NOW!
( cheering )
I THINK WE'RE ALL RIGHT NOW.
OH, THANK GOD FOR YOU, FAITH.
THANK GOD FOR YOU.
THIS IS WAY ABOVE AND BEYOND
THE CALL OF DUTY FOR A STAND-IN.
I MUST TELL YOU, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THE SERVICE YOU'VE PERFORMED FOR SIMONE,
SHIELDING HER FROM THESE ANIMALS.
OH, NO, MR. TARANSKY.
THANK GOD FOR YOU.
- FOR ME?
- YEAH.
HOW MANY DIRECTORS WOULD GO
TO SO MUCH TROUBLE TO PROTECT AN ACTRESS?
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GO BACK TO MY PLACE,
JUST TO, YOU KNOW, KEEP THEM OFF THE SCENT.
OF COURSE.
YOU LOOKS SO...
SO MUCH LIKE...
UM, LIKE HER?
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
LIKE HER.
BUT YOU'RE SO VERY BEAUTIFUL
IN YOUR OWN RIGHT.
I DO FIND MYSELF STRANGELY ATTRACTED TO YOU, MR. TARANSKY.
CALL ME VIKTOR.
VIKTOR.
- OH.
- OH, VIKTOR.
- VIKTOR.
- YES?
- THIS IS SO EXCITING.
- YES.
DO WHAT YOU DO TO SIMONE?
WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I SAID DO WHATEVER YOU DO TO SIMONE.
WHAT I DO TO SIMONE?
CALL ME SIMONE!
SIMONE?
YES.
SAY IT AGAIN, PLEASE.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE HER JUST FOR ONE NIGHT.
PLEASE, CALL ME SIMONE.
YOU'RE WITH ME SO YOU CAN BE CLOSE TO HER?
IS THAT A PROBLEM?
OKAY.
EXCUSE ME JUST A MINUTE.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
WELL, ACTUALLY,
MAYBE WE CAN DO THIS SOME OTHER TIME
- OR SOMETHING.
- ARE YOU BUSY TOMORROW?
GENTLEMEN, THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE.
AHEM--
I THINK THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
Concierge:
YES, SIR.
I BELIEVE IT WILL.
LEAVE ME FOR A MOMENT.
SIMONE.
( whimpers )
( harmonic vocals )
( applause )
- BRILLIANT.
-ELAINE!
- THERE SHE IS.
-THE PICTURE--
THE PICTURE.
IT'S A REVELATION.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WE ALL WORKED SO HARD.
- Man:
IT WAS YOU.
-Elaine:
NO, IT WAS ALL OF US.
Elaine:
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU ALL.
THANK YOU.
- WHOA!
- Man:
VIKTOR!
-Man:
IS SHE HERE?
- VIKTOR, IS SHE HERE?
OH, I'M FINE, HAL.
HOW ARE YOU?
SOMEBODY SAID SHE WAS HERE.
JESUS.
THAT'S HER GLASS.
( sniffs ) JACK DANIELS, STRAIGHT UP.
- MY KIND OF WOMAN.
- COME ON, WHERE IS SHE?
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S, UH...
IS THAT HER BY THE FOUNTAIN?
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
- SHE DOESN'T REALLY EXIST
- SIMONE!
-SIMONE!
- SIMONE'S HERE?
- WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY TELL ME?
- SHE'S HERE?
!
- SIMONE!
- I GOT YOUR GLASS!
-I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN!
- ( chattering )
Crowd:
SIMONE!
- SIMONE!
- SIMONE?
( screaming )
Man:
GET OUT!
NOT YOU TWO.
SHE GOES TO A MAJOR HOLLYWOOD A-LIST PARTY
AND WE DON'T GET AN INTERVIEW,
A COMMENT?
WE DON'T EVEN GET A PHOTOGRAPH?
!
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?
NOBODY GOT A PHOTOGRAPH.
NOBODY EVER GETS A PHOTOGRAPH.
- WE HAVE OUR BEST PEOPLE ON IT, MR. SAYER.
- GET BETTER PEOPLE!
WHAT ABOUT THE 24-HOUR TAIL ON TARANSKY?
THEY'RE CAMPED OUT EVERY PLACE HE GOES;
EVERY CONCIERGE,
EVERY MAITRE D', THEY'RE ALL ON THE TAKE.
BUT THIS SIMONE WOMAN IS GOOD.
OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS NOT HER REAL NAME.
SHE USES AN ASSUMED IDENTITY.
SHE TRAVELS UNDER A FALSE NAME.
SHE CHECKS INTO A HOTEL UNDER AN ALIAS.
NEVER STAYS IN THE SAME PLACE TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW.
WHAT ABOUT THE SATELLITE PHOTOS?
WHAT HAPPENED?
- NOTHIN'.
- NOTHING FROM SPACE?
!
WHAT ABOUT THE FINGERPRINTS?
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE DUSTED THAT WHOLE HOTEL SUITE?
WELL, WE HAVE SOME OF TARANSKY'S FINGERPRINTS,
A LOT OF YOURS...
AND NONE OF HERS.
NO ONE IS THAT PERFECT, THAT PURE.
YOU KNOW, I HAD SOMETHING ON MOTHER THERESA ONCE.
AND THEN SHE DIED
AND IT JUST WASN'T WORTH IT ANYMORE.
I KNOW HOW TO FLUSH OUT THIS SIMONE WOMAN.
A TELL-ALL STORY FROM HER CHILDHOOD.
YOU HAVE ONE?
I WILL WHEN YOU'RE FINISHE D WRITING IT.
Walter:
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS.
Elaine:
GUARD, OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW.
-MR.
TARANSKY GAVE ME SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS--
- NO!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
!
- MR. TARANSKY!
- WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
!
- WE HAVE TO TALK TO HER!
- WE KNOW SHE'S IN THERE.
- OKAY.
- WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
- WE'VE GOT THE TRACKING NUMBERS FOR "ETERNITY FOREVER."
- THEY'RE IN THE TOILET.
- SHE'S GOTTA GET OUT THERE AND SELL THE FILM.
WHAT DO YOU WANT HER TO DO, GO DOOR-TO-DOOR?
EVEN GARBO WOULD BE ON THE TALK SHOW CIRCUIT IF SHE WERE ALIVE!
IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T CRAVE THE LIMELIGHT
THAT PEOPLE LOVE HER!
- THIS IS BULLSHIT!
- SHE IS ABOUT THE WORK AND ONLY THE WORK!
THIS IS OVERSHADOWING THE WORK.
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE HER, I WILL.
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME.
SHE'S EMOTIONAL.
TODAY, HER MOTHER DIES.
SCENE 42 OF "GOOD FOR NOTHING."
- THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME.
- IT NEVER IS.
- STEP ASIDE!
- WE'RE GOING IN!
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
- NO!
NO!
- Viktor:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
!
- Man:
SIMONE!
I TRUSTED YOU.
- SIMONE?
- YOU CAN COME OUT, IT'S ELAINE!
- WE JUST WANT TO HAVE A MEETING.
- Elaine:
WE CAN TALK,
- GIRL-TO-GIRL.
JUST US.
- WHERE IS SHE?
- SHE'S GONE.
- WHERE ARE THE SETS?
- GOD, THAT IS SO LIKE HER
- WHERE ARE THE CAMERAS?
VIKTOR, WE'RE NOT PAYI NG FOR THIS ARE WE?
WHAT IS ALL THIS?
WHAT IS ALL THIS?
WELL...
I SUPPOSE
IT WAS GONNA COME OUT SOONER OR LATER.
I GUESS I'M ACTUALLY RELIEVED IN A WAY.
I CAN JUST SAY IT FINALLY.
SHE'S A COMPUTER--
ADDICT.
WHAT?
SHE'S A COMPUTER ADDICT!
SHE'S BURIED IN HERE.
DAY IN, DAY OUT.
Elaine:
OF COURSE.
I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED.
IT'S WHY SHE NEVER GOES ANYWHERE,
WHY SHE'S NEVER SE EN IN PUBLIC.
- NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT.
- PROBABLY SPENDS HER WHOLE LIFE IN CHATROOMS.
- THE ONE PLACE SHE CAN BE HERSELF.
- ANONYMOUS.
ONLY IT'S WORSE.
IT'S FAR WORSE.
SHE'S EXTREMELY AGORAPHOBIC.
SHE HAS A MORBID FEAR OF PEOPLE,
OF GERMS,
PLACES, HEIGHTS--
-NAME IT.
- THIS IS TERRIBLE.
HOW IS SHE GOING TO PLUG THE FILM?
-YES, INDEED.
-SHE HAS TO DO PUBLICITY.
MAYBE I COULD GET HER TO DO SOMETHING.
MAYBE A TELEVISION TALK SHOW OR SOMETHING.
( together ) YES!
- TAPED.
- MAKE IT LIVE, PLEASE.
- LIVE?
- PLEASE.
SHE'D NEVER GO THERE.
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOTE.
WE CAN WORK WITH THAT.
I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING.
- WE UNDERSTAND.
- THANK YOU, VIKTOR.
- THANK YOU, VIKTOR.
- DON'T GROVEL.
THANK YOU.
Man:
GIVE HER OUR BEST.
THAT AGORAPHOBIA-- IT'S LIKE A PLAGUE.
IT'S OUT OF CONTROL IN EUROPE.
IT'S SO GOOD OF YOU TO PROTECT HER LIKE THIS.
SHE WANTED YOU--
NO, NO.
DON'T TOUCH THAT.
GERMS.
SHE WANTED YOU TO HAVE THAT.
SHE WAS THERE.
SHE WAS RIGHT THERE.
Viktor:
YEAH.
OH, MY GOSH.
SHE DIDN'T, BY ANY CHANCE,
HAPPEN TO MENTION ME?
ACTUALLY, SHE DID.
SHE, UH...
SHE SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL.
- REALLY?
- YEAH.
WOULD YOU WANT TO GO
AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT, OR SOMETHING?
VIKTOR, I'D LOVE TO, REALLY.
BUT DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO TALK TO SIMONE?
IF I CAN FIND HER.
WELL.
Elaine:
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD.
- THANKS, VIKTOR.
- THANK YOU.
I'M GONNA-
- BYE.
Man:
Tonight, on Frank Brand Live-- since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset,"
no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone--
Until now.
I'm happy to say that she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
Simone:
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Frank:
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Simone:
Don't I know it.
But the only reason I'm here now, is to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screentime on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand, Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Frank:
Change of topic.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking, Fidel Castro, most recently, Viktor Taransky.
Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
( computer beeps )
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure.
Where would you like to start, Frank?
-How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
I KNOW THAT TREE.
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I KNOW THAT TREE.
- I KNOW WHERE THAT IS.
- What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in, is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
( computer beeping )
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But, before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simone.
( sighs )
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
ON MY HONEYMOON WITH MY EX-WIFE.
YEAH, LOOK.
IT'S THE EXACT SAME TREE.
AND LOOK IN THE DISTANCE.
THE MOUNTAIN.
Milton:
IT'S A HOTEL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
COULD THEY HAVE BUILT THAT HOTEL SINCE YESTERDAY?
GET IN THE CAR.
Crowd chanting:
SIMONE!
SIMONE!
( booing )
WE DON'T DO THE PHOTOS, YOU DON'T GET THE COVER.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
YES.
WRITTEN ANSWERS TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS.
DIDN'T WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE?
YEAH, WEB SITE INTERVIEWS, NO PROBLEM.
I think people are gonna love "Eternity Forever."
"Eternity Forever" is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of "Eternity Forever." He's a genius.
YOU WISH.
It's wonderful being a movie star.
But there's so many other ways I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too.
If you really want to make a difference.
( gasps )
Sayer:
NICE BOAT, TARANSKY!
IT'S NOT A BOAT,
IT'S A YACHT.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
I THINK YOU DO, 'CAUSE I KNOW IT'S A FAKE.
Milton:
IT'S BOGUS.
YOU USED AN OLD LIBRARY SHOT FOR THE BACKGROUND.
SHE NEVER WAS IN NEW MEXICO.
SHE NEVER EVEN LEFT THE STUDIO.
I'VE DONE MY HOMEWORK.
- I'VE STUDIED HER.
- I BET YOU HAVE.
I'VE LOOKED AT EVERY PIECE OF PUBLICITY SHE'S DONE.
AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THAT SHE HAS EVER LEFT THE STUDIO.
OH...
AND FOR SOME REASON,
THIS WOMAN LEAVES NO PAPER TRAIL?
NOW, I'VE OBTAINED A COPY OF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.
I KNOW YOU HAVE POWER OF ATTORNEY,
BUT SO FAR, YOU HAVE NOT TURNED OVER
A SINGLE SOLITARY CENT TO THIS WOMAN.
I KEEP IT IN THE TRUST.
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE,
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,
EMBEZZLEMENT IS A SERIOUS MATTER.
NOT TO MENTION ABDUCTION.
- ABDUCTION?
- YEAH.
OFF THE RECORD.
I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU'RE DOING IT.
IS IT DRUGS?
IS IT MIND CONTROL?
IS IT BLACKMAIL?
IS IT ALL THREE?
WHAT DO YOU DO?
DO YOU KEEP HER LOCKED IN A BOX SOMEWHERE?
WHAT IS IT EXACTLY
THAT YOU WANT?
I WANT TO SEE HER.
UNLESS YOU SHOW ME SIMONE LIVE AND IN PERSON,
I SHOW THESE PHOTOS TO THE AUTHORITIES.
YOU WANT TO SEE HER?
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT A DEAL.
YOU WANT TO SEE HER?
YOU'RE GONNA SEE HER!
GOOD!
Man:
MR. TARANSKY.
- HELLO, GENTLEMEN.
- WE'RE ALL READY.
THIS TIME TOMORROW NIGHT, SHE'LL BE STANDING RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF 100,000 PEOPLE.
WE COULD'VE SOLD THIS OUT 20 TIMES.
YEAH, THE SOUND CHECK WENT GREAT.
THE LASER SHOW IS GOOD TO GO.
I GOTTA ASK YOU, THOUGH,
YOU ORDERED AN AWFUL LOT OF SMOKE.
WELL, THAT'S THE WAY SHE WANTS IT.
AFTER YOU TOLD US ABOUT THE DEATH THREATS,
SECURITY GUARDS ARE UNDER STRICT INSTRUCTION
- NEVER TO TAKE THEIR EYES OFF THE CROWD
- EXCELLENT.
HERE, SIMONE WANTED YOU TO HAVE THESE.
- UNREAL.
-AND REMEMBER--
NO CAMERAS, NO BINOCULARS.
( crowd cheering )
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour.
LET'S GET YOU INTO HAIR AND MAKEUP.
NO.
- I didn't think you'd be here.
- I figured I'd stick around.
So you got it.
Just barely.
The cops we were trying to nail, they knew we were coming.
- You all got out OK?
- Yeah, but everybody's really spooked.
The S1W takes on police corruption.
You didn't think it was gonna be easy?
Just get Eyes Only to do the broadcast tonight.
I need something on record, otherwise the cops can make us out to be the bad guys.
- You got it.
- Thanks.
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Logan, I'm telling you something, somebody's onto us.
Officials hail Anselmo as a courageous individual who paid the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of higher justice.
Do not attempt to adjust your set.
This cable hack will last exactly 60 seconds.
It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped.
And it is the only free voice left in this city.
Activist group the S1Whas again been busy in defence of your freedom, securing indisputable physical evidence of wholesale corruption in the sector police force.
God!
How many times have you played this before?
Never.
You might wanna move.
Move!
Move!
Move!
Get down!
Everybody down!
Freeze!
Stop right there!
All right!
God, man, that bullet.
How'd you know?
He needs a doctor.
He needs a doctor!
That's all of 'em!
They designed her to be the perfect soldier, a human weapon.
Then she escaped.
In a future not far from now, in a broken world, she is haunted by her past.
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.
Last night here in Sector Four, an anonymous tip led police to this building, headquarters of dissident group S1W, and the arrest of at least six members.
You hearing this, people?
Anonymous tips.
That's how we get these outlaws off the street.
- They're not outlaws.
- Oh, yeah?
Says who?
They're just trying to expose corrupt sector cops.
Interesting theory, Miss Late As Usual.
How'd you get to be an expert on the S1W?
So what do you know about the S1W?
Why?
You thinking of phoning me in?
- So what's up with our little Maxie here?
- What do you mean?
Maybe we got ourselves an S1W type right underneath our noses.
- She fits the profile.
- Yeah, I heard.
What do I do?
Zero respect for authority, erratic behaviour, lots of unexplained absences...
OK, I'll go get it.
Plus I think she's got a lot of underlying hostility.
- What are you two looking at?
- Nothing.
I just got a delivery here for Alec.
What do you know?
It's right near where the S1W was arrested.
I'll take that.
What did I tell you?
Yo, Mikey!
Check me out, man.
I'm winning.
- What are you doing here?
- Right back at ya.
- I'm looking for something.
- Asha's address book?
Yeah.
Me, too.
Don't act like it's some big secret.
Asha's in the S1W.
They got arrested here.
- What's it got to do with you?
- My number's in it.
- You and the S1W, fighting the power.
- Who said anything about the S1W?
Asha asked for my number one night at Crash.
- She asked?
- Or maybe I offered it to her.
It was during that mermaid thing.
I was feeling lonely.
Consider your lonely ass saved.
Here's her backpack.
Have you ever pretended to write down a guy's phone number?
What's this?
Asha likes poetry?
It's none of your business.
Get a load of this. "Oh, love, let me raise you softer than moonbeams."
- Makes you wonder who she's writing to.
- Could be anyone.
It could be about anyone, but here's an interesting fact:
Logan's name is in her book.
- They work together.
- I'm sure they do.
- That's why I'm here.
- Because they work together?
- I don't want Logan's name in a police file.
- With Asha's.
- With the S1W.
- OK, right.
- Now, Logan used to be your thing.
- We weren't even like that.
So when Logan asks you to get his poetess friend Asha outta jail, you jump at the cha...
- We weren't designed to be chumps, Max.
- People were arrested here last night.
They risked their lives for something more important than themselves.
They were rounded up because some snitch turned them in.
One guy was wounded.
Forget the cheap shots.
Even if that were true, it wouldn't matter.
It's not about me.
- Max.
- What?
Or maybe it is about you.
Hey, neighbour.
I'm kind of expecting someone at 7.03.
So I'll be away two days at least.
So I was wondering, if it's not too much trouble, if maybe you could get my mail while I'm gone?
Huh, neighbour?
I'm sorry.
Did you say something?
You know, I can't actually remember what he looked like.
You kind of don't notice him.
- You don't notice him?
- It's hard to explain.
- He's got game.
- Yeah, and he was barely trying.
He was just...
I don't know.
- It's like he sees everything.
- What do you mean, "sees everything"?
This'll sound crazy, but it's like he knows what's gonna happen before it happens.
- Yeah, that sounds crazy.
- He knew that raid was coming.
And you see that bullet hole over there?
He ducked before the shot was fired.
Made me duck, too.
The bullet went right over our heads.
He saved my life.
Do you know how to find this guy?
- Max.
Is that Brian?
- Looks like Brain.
113, 125th Place.
Just like he said.
He said the hottest chick I'd ever seen would show up looking for him.
I guess that's you, huh?
Shut up.
Nature's miracle, that's what it is, white and hearty and true.
Not ostrich or emu or goose, it's straight from the chicken to you.
So if you wanna feel healthy, here's what you'll do:
Break an egg.
That means you.
Break an egg.
OK.
Keep your voice down.
Don't knock either.
- Why?
- You lose the element of surprise.
- What surprise?
He's expecting us.
- It could be a trap.
- I think we can handle him.
- "We"?
No one asked you to tag along.
That's right.
You were supposed to come alone.
OK, this is totally unnecessary.
- This is the guy who turned them in?
- Looks like.
He admits he knew the raid was going down.
Although, according to him, only to a 73% certainty.
Hello.
OK, these things are a little tight.
I don't know if I mentioned it but I bruise easily.
Look, I'm trying to help you, Max.
- Do you know him?
- I think he's got a little thing for Max.
We'll deal with him and his little thing later.
They're moving the S1W in an hour.
There's a chance to intercept on Highway 153.
That's a bad idea.
There's a railroad crossing in disrepair along the route.
It's a mile from the poultry farm.
If you're thinking about the train track, think again.
- What is this?
- It's 92% failure scenarios.
OK, I need you to shut up.
County roads in the area allow unacceptable delivery rates of backup sector personnel.
The probabilities of subsequent apprehension is like... 3157 Mercer Street?
Is this your idea of a secret meeting place, huh?
- "I will love you like the..."
- Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Eyes Only?
I just wanna read it.
The crossing'll be deserted.
The bus'll stop.
It'll be easy.
What's that?
- Nothing.
- Poetry.
It's nothing.
Stay with what's-his-name and we'll do the rest.
What is his name?
- Brain.
- Brian.
- Be careful.
- "Be careful." That cost him.
- I can do this alone.
- I'm on board.
The only way it'll work is if you break an egg!
You hear me, Max?
Break an egg!
Well, well.
- Max.
- Got your back.
- Max, it's a silent alarm.
- The keys.
Find the keys.
Alec?
Drive.
Drive!
- The fat kid may have been right.
- We'll make it.
I'm glad to hear that.
We're being followed.
- We're all clear ahead.
- Yeah, except for the police cruisers.
- Just find the key.
- Only 150 more to go.
- What did Brain say before we left?
- Bad plan.
- I mean, as we were leaving.
- Break a leg.
- No, he said egg.
He said break an egg.
- It doesn't matter what he said.
Hold on.
Everyone hold on!
No, Max, no!
No!
- He needs help.
- I'm OK.
- How'd it go, Max?
- Kind of weird, actually.
Hold on.
- How'd you know?
- Know what?
- Break an egg.
- The cops, the train.
- Did I get the schedule wrong?
- No.
- Then what are you mad about?
- Tell us how you knew.
How do you think I knew?
I'm an X-series, just like you.
Huh.
Yep.
- What are you?
- What am I?
- You don't exactly look like a soldier.
- Oh, and you two do?
I'm an IT Concentrate.
A battle processor.
I'm basically a general, his staff, two database groups, and five logistical support teams, all rolled into one stealth package.
- "Stealth." Yeah.
- People look away.
They don't remember me.
There, are you happy?
- That doesn't explain your psychic ability.
- Psychic?
Please.
I combine near-absolute data knowledge with fast neural nets for heuristics.
Heuristics?
Predictions using probability algorithms stored in my...
- Are you sure you wanna hear this?
- Whatever you call it, you can tell the future.
I can see our future.
Yours and mine.
That's why I'm here, Max.
Get the feeling he's got something else on his mind other than betraying the S1W?
But I didn't betray the S1W.
It was one of them.
Come on.
- I don't wanna get outta town.
- You don't have a choice.
They have photos of you now.
Fingerprints.
It's just a matter of time before they pick you up again.
- This yours?
- Thanks.
There's personal stuff in there you might wanna keep track of.
Address book, poems.
- Come on.
- What are you doing?
- S1W went down cos of him.
- Or not.
That's what I'm thinking.
Don't worry.
I'll keep him on a short leash.
It was nice seeing you again.
You're right about the S1W.
One of them's a police informant.
They free political prisoners, play Robin Hood, and the cops leave them alone.
Then they attack police corruption head-on and get nailed.
- Pay attention.
- I am.
What did I just say?
You were wondering what, if anything, is going on between blondie and you know who.
- Let's stick with who's the informant.
- I don't know who.
I pulled up the arrest reports from the police databases, so just do your thing.
OK, that's the guy that got shot, so we know it's not him.
Unless that's what we're supposed to think and it is him.
On this next one, could you be a little more, what was it, heuristic?
Ooh.
Yeah, she's gonna be a lot heavier than I am when she's 30.
- 93% certainty.
- Did she turn them in?
- No idea.
- OK, then.
This guy.
What about him?
I don't know who he is.
Max went to get your address book and came back with some crazy guy who knows a lot about the S1W.
- Not a lot.
Everything.
- Max seems to think he's OK.
Yeah, well, Max wasn't turned in, was she?
- What you're saying is none of 'em did it?
- Maybe all of them did it.
Or maybe not.
- Look, I'm not optimised for this.
- It's OK.
We're finally together and I'm letting you down.
You don't remember me at all, do you?
From back at Manticore?
That's all right.
I'm designed to be forgettable.
But I remember you, with your short hair and your cammies, and you could blur and everything.
I used to watch you and your friends running around just having a blast.
It was no blast, believe me.
When you broke out, leaving the rest of us behind,
I thought I was gonna die, I missed you so much.
Look, Brain... we didn't know each other.
I knew you.
They fed us data on all the X5s to predict battle behaviour.
And I stayed after every day, learning everything there was to know about you.
I knew you.
That data they fed you, it wasn't me.
I knew you'd come back to Manticore.
And you did.
I knew you'd get involved the second S1W got into trouble.
- That's why I'm here.
- What do you mean, that's why you're here?
I know you better than anyone, Max.
And I would do anything for you.
What I really need you to do is tell me who the informant is, OK?
- Aw.
- What?
There was a 0.05% chance that you were gonna lean over and kiss me right then.
I was just hoping.
- OK.
- Let's go.
If she's on our side, why's she protecting him?
- She's not protecting him.
- Then where is he?
Why don't we concentrate on getting you guys outta town?
Why don't you call me when you get there?
You've got my number.
- Who's he working for?
- He's not working for anyone.
- He saved your asses.
- Is that what he says?
That's what I say.
You're blaming the wrong guy.
I think sector police will approach in a scatter Y formation,
Alpha Team in the stairwell, Bravo in the elevator.
A third team will stake out the roof.
- What is he talking about?
- Shut up!
Egress through a fire stairwell, 54 steps to the second floor.
There's a fan behind a grate in the hallway.
Use it.
It's your only way out.
- When?
- Now!
Go!
Do what he says!
Get out of here!
You trust him, you lead the way.
I got one!
I think.
Ow.
- Yeah?
- We're at the pick-up point.
- How you doing?
- I'm off to the frozen north.
I don't know who to trust.
I'm not happy about this.
Well, I'm not happy about it either.
If you two aren't happy, I'm not happy.
Max, are you happy?
Shut up!
No, not you.
There should be a loading ramp by the garage.
OK.
A truck will back in at 4.05.
That's your ride to Canada.
The driver's a friend of Eyes Only.
He knows the entire situation.
Detective Sung said Brain's in lockdown at 12th precinct.
I'm gonna get him.
Hear that?
The big guy's in lockdown, so it's hard to figure him for a police informant.
So until we know who is... be careful.
- Keep your departure plans to yourself.
- Logan, don't hang up yet.
It's just...
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.
You're gonna be fine.
Good luck.
Just stay in touch.
What in the world do they see in you?
Oh, it's you.
Spare me.
You knew I'd be coming for you.
You must have been expecting someone.
Or did you think you could really slip through those bars?
- That's hurtful.
- Let's get going.
The guard I stole this uniform off of won't be out for ever.
What's with the ankle?
While the cops were storming the place and you guys were all getting away,
I had this thought.
Oh, left, left.
Maybe people don't see me because there's nothing to see.
Are you sure this is the fastest way out?
What's the point of knowing everything but doing nothing about it?
I'm not seeing an exit anywhere soon.
Anyways, that's why I turned myself in.
You what?
I'm dying because you turned yourself in on purpose?
I thought you were supposed to be strong.
I'm not Superwoman.
Here.
Hurry.
Right there.
They're coming.
Gently, gently.
OK.
- Do you know what the chance of this is?
- Of you turning yourself in?
No.
Of you and me, here together in this exact precinct, in this exact office, you wearing that uniform, me and my sprained ankle, in this exact moment in space and time?
Do you know what the chance is?
- Who knows?
One in a trillion?
- No.
It's 100%.
We're here, right?
- OK.
I see where all this is going now.
- Where?
Where's it going?
You mean where are you going?
Because you're running.
Running through a passageway, drawn onward by distant voices.
There's machinery.
Steam.
It's some kind of factory.
No, it's a sawmill.
Oh!
- What?
- You look so beautiful when you run.
What are the voices?
You said "drawn onward by distant voices."
- I said that? "Drawn onward"?
- That's what you said.
Well, OK, then.
You're drawn onward by distant voices.
Voices of the S1W being held captive by the traitor in their midst.
OK, you descend a staircase, into another passageway, headed for a door at the end.
There's a sign on the door.
It says...
What?
What does it say?
"Drawn onward." I really said that?
What's the sign say?
OK.
The sign.
It says..."danger".
But because you're you, you don't stop.
Instead, you kick the door open...
What?
What happened?
- I don't know.
Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
I mean, why did I take so long to find you?
I don't buy any of it.
Why am I supposed to believe you just happen to know all this?
How could anyone just happen to know all this?
Why do you think we're here?
- That's just like Asha's book.
- It's an old CIA trick.
- A poem?
- Not a poem.
A coded message, keyed to matching books.
That's how the informant's been communicating with the cops.
What are you saying?
Asha's a traitor?
Look at the bright side.
At least she's not writing love poems to Logan.
No, it doesn't make any sense.
Betraying the S1W would hurt Logan.
- She wouldn't do that.
- Good point.
It must have been someone else's book you found.
Whose?
Beats me.
- You took my book.
- No, it ended up in my backpack somehow.
Lucky for me.
I was afraid I'd lost it.
- What does it say?
- "Oh, love, softness swelling..."
I mean decoded!
The traitor's the group leader, the guy who got shot.
- He's dangerous, Max, so...
- I know - be careful.
I was gonna say let's turn around and forget the whole thing.
We could live happily ever after.
That's 97% certain.
- Brain?
- Yeah?
- Watch the hands!
- I'm just trying to hang on!
Hang on a little lower!
Not that low.
- It's 4.05.
Time to move.
- Where?
We've got a ride to Canada.
Let's go, then.
- Wish me luck.
- Max, wait.
The poem you found in Asha's backpack...
- You mean the coded message.
- Yeah.
Only you didn't know that at the time.
And you helped her anyway.
- How do I look?
- What do you mean?
How do I look?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Something that's gonna happen?
Well...
I never actually noticed before, but... kind of... magnificent.
- Fall back!
- Freeze!
Stay where you are!
- This way.
- Where are we going?
- This way.
- The gunfire's stopped.
- More's coming.
- How do you know?
Just go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Team two, take the far door!
Come on, let's go!
Move, move!
Hey, come on.
Let us out!
Because you're running.
Running through a passageway, drawn onward by distant voices.
Voices of the S1W being held captive by the traitor in their midst.
You descend a staircase into another passageway, headed for a door at the end.
There's a sign on the door.
It says danger.
Brain.
You'll be all right.
Egress through that door.
93 feet.
Turn right.
Hurry.
Let's go.
- You saw this, didn't you?
- I saw you.
You saved me.
What are the chances?
You, me?
100%.
Max...
I don't mind if no one else ever saw me.
I just wanted to be seen by you.
Clear that area!
Clear!
Brain.
Brain?
I got your message.
Is it true?
Yeah, it's true.
All the police files from the arrest are gone.
- Your record's clean.
- So I can stay?
- You all can.
- God, Logan, thanks.
Don't thank me.
Apparently, a candy bar melted on the precinct system server, ruined all the data.
- Wow.
What are the chances of that?
- According to Max, they're...
- What?
- Better than you'd think.
So you wanna come along?
Tell the group the good news?
I promised someone I'd do them a favour.
How about if I meet you guys there later?
Tell Max I'm sorry, OK?
About her friend.
OK.
Where shall I see you?
Where will you go?
I'll meet you at the manor after I've seen Frank.
- Take care of yourself, darling.
- I will.
It's bright and warm outside, thank goodness.
I'll be all right.

I don't know how he stood it.
All that noise, I mean.
All around us, a battle wages...
Why are you here?
Never a welcoming word with you, is there?
Well?
Maybe...
Maybe I wanted to make sure you're OK.
The courageous among us are called more often than others to sacrifice.
A great and fearless warrior in this battle died today...
- "Great and fearless warrior"?
- It doesn't matter what they say.
I just want people to see him.
Overlooked in his lifetime by all of us...
- Why are you here?
- Like I said...
You sold his TVs, didn't you?
Not all of them.
I'm gonna keep one for myself.
- You're moving in?
- It's not like he needs the place any more.
You know, I never really noticed, but he's actually kind of magnificent.
Yeah.
He was.
- I didn't think you'd be here.
- I figured I'd stick around.
- So you got it.
- Just barely.
Cops you're trying to nail - they knew we were coming.
- You all got out okay?
- Yeah, but everybody's real spooked.
Well, the S1W takes on police corruption.
You didn't think it was gonna be easy, did you?
Listen, just get Eyes Only to do the broadcast tonight, okay?
I really need something on record.
Otherwise the cops can say anything they want and they can make us out to be the bad guys.
- You got it.
- Thanks.
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
I -
Logan, I'm telling you something.
Somebody's on to us.

Freeze!
Stop right there!

Anonymous tips.
That's how we get these outlaws off the street.
- They're not outlaws.
- Oh yeah?
Says who?
They're just trying to expose corrupt sector cops.
Well, that's an interesting theory, Miss Late-as-Usual.
And how exactly did you get to be such an expert on the S1W?
- So how do you know about the S1W?
- Why?
Thinking of phoning me in?
- So what's up with our little Maxie here?
- What do you mean?
Maybe we got ourselves an S1W type right underneath our noses?
She fits the profile.
Yeah, I heard.
What do I do?
Zero respect for authority, erratic behavior, lots of unexplained absences...
Okay, I'll go get it.
Plus I think she's got a lot of underlying hostility.
- What are you two lookin' at?
- Nothing.
I just got a, uh, delivery here for Alec.
Oh, what do you know, it's right near where the S1W was arrested.
I'll take that.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, yo, Mikey - check me out, man, I'm winning.
- What are you doing here?
- Right back at ya.
- Looking for something.
- Asha's address book?
Yeah, me too.
Oh, what?
Like it's some big secret?
Asha's in the S1W.
And they got arrested here last night.
- Yeah, so what's that got to do with you?
- My number's in the book.
Oh, sure.
You and the S1W, fightin' the power.
Who said anything about the S1W?
Asha asked for my number one night at Crash.
- She asked?
- Or maybe I offered it to her.
I don't know - it was during that whole mermaid thing.
I was feelin' kinda lonely.
Consider your lonely ass saved.
Here's her backpack.
Okay, question - have you ever pretended to write down a guy's phone number?
What's this?
Asha likes poetry?
It's none of your business.
Hey, get a load of this. "Oh, love, let me raise you softer than moonbeams..."
Kinda makes you wonder who she's writing to.
Could be anyone.
You're right, it could be about anyone, but, uh, here's an interesting fact.
Logan's name is in her book.
- They work together.
- Yeah, I'm sure they do.
- They do, smartass.
That's why I'm here.
- Oh, because they work together?
No, because I don't want Logan's name to end up in some police file.
- With Asha's.
- With the S1W.
Oh, okay, right, right.
Now, Logan used to be your thing.
We weren't even like that.
So when Logan asks you to go get his poetess friend Asha out of jail, you jump at the cha...
We weren't designed to be chumps, Max.
People were arrested here last night.
Do you even get that?
People risking their lives for something more important than themselves.
They were rounded up because some snitch turned them in.
One guy was wounded.
- Max...
So forget the cheap shots, because even if that were true, it wouldn't matter, 'cause it's not about me.
- Max...
- What?
Or maybe it is about you.
Hey, neighbor.
Yeah, I'm kind of expecting someone at, oh, 7:03.
So I'll be away two days, at least.
So I was wondering, I mean, if it's not too much trouble, if maybe you could... get my mail while I'm gone?
Huh, neighbor?
I'm sorry, did you say something?
You know, I can't actually remember what he looked like.
You kind of don't notice him.
- Don't notice him?
- It's hard to explain.
- He's got game.
- Yeah, and he was barely trying.
He was just...
I don't know...
it's like he sees everything.
- What do you mean, sees everything?
- Okay, this is gonna sound crazy, but... it's like he knows what's gonna happen before it happens.
- Yeah, that sounds crazy.
- He knew that raid was coming.
You see that bullet hole over there?
He ducked before the shot was fired.
Made me duck too.
The bullet went right over our heads.
He saved my life.
You wouldn't by any chance know how to find this guy?
Max.
- What's that? "Brian"?
- Looks like "Brain".
One-thirteen 125th Place.
Just like he said.
Told me the hottest chick I'd ever seen was gonna show up looking for him.
I guess that's you, huh?
Shut up!
...it's nature's miracle.
That's what it is.
White, hearty, and true.
Not ostrich, or emu, or goose.
It's straight from the chicken to you.
So if you want to feel healthy, here's what you'll do.
Break an egg.
That means you.
"Break an egg".
Okay.
- Keep your voice down.
Don't knock, either.
- Why?
- 'Cause you lose the element of surprise.
- What surprise?
That kid said he's expecting us.
- Yeah, but it could be a trap.
- Please.
I think we can handle him.
- Whoa. "We"?
- Nobody asked you to tag along.
That's right.
You were supposed to come alone.
Okay, this is totally unnecessary.
- So this is the guy who turned them in?
- Looks like.
Says he admits he knew the raid was going down.
Although, according to him, only to a 73% certainty.
Hello?
Okay, these things are a little tight.
I don't know if I mentioned it, but I bruise easily.
Look, I'm trying to help you, Max!
- You know him?
- I think he's got a little thing for Max.
Well, we'll have to deal with him and his "little thing" later.
They're moving the S1W to a federal facility in about an hour, and there's an opportunity to intercept on Highway 153.
Oh, that's a bad idea.
There's a railroad grade crossing in serious disrepair along the route.
It's about a mile from the Somerset Poultry Farm.
If you're thinking about the train track, think again.
What is this?
- It's 92% failure scenarios.
- Okay, I need you to shut up.
County roads in the area allow unacceptable delivery rates of backup sector personnel.
I mean, the probability of subsequent apprehension is - is - is like... 3157 Mercer Street?
!
Is this your idea of a secret meeting place, huh?
- "I will love you like the..."
- Hey!
What are you doing?
- Eyes Only?
- Put it away!
- It's okay.
- Give it here!
It's just nice.
I just want to read it.
Crossing'll be deserted.
Bus'll come to a complete stop.
It should be easy in, easy out.
What's that?
- Nothing.
- Poetry.
It's nothing!
Stay with what's-his-name and we'll do the rest.
So what's his name?
- Brain.
- Brian.
- Be careful.
- "Be careful".
That cost him.
- I'll do this alone if I have to.
- I'm on board.
Look, the only way it'll work is if you break an egg!
You hear me, Max?
Break an egg!
Well, well.
- Max.
- Got your back.
Max.
It's a silent alarm.
The keys.
Find the keys!
Alec...
Drive.
Drive!
You know, I'm thinking the fat kid may have been right.
We'll make it.
I'm glad to hear that, because we're being followed.
- We're all clear ahead.
- Yeah, except for the police cruisers.
- Just find the key!
- Only a hundred and fifty more to go!
- What did Brain say before we left?
- "Bad plan"?
- I mean as we were leaving.
- "Break a leg."
- No, he said "egg".
He said "Break an egg".
- What's it matter what he said?
Hold on.
Everyone hold on!
Max, no...
- Let's go, lads.
He needs help.
- Don't worry, I'm okay.
- How'd it go, Max?
- Kinda weird, actually.
Hold on.
- How'd you know?
- Know what?
- "Break an egg."
- And the cops, and the train...
- Did I get the schedule wrong?
- No.
- Then what are you mad about?
- Just tell us how you knew.
How do you think I knew?
I'm an X-series, just like you.
- What are you?
- What am I?
Yeah, she means you don't exactly look like a soldier there, big guy.
Oh, and you two do?
I'm an I.T. concentrate.
A battle processor.
I'm basically a general, his staff, two database groups, and five logistical support teams, all rolled into one stealth package.
- Stealth.
Yeah.
- People look away.
They don't remember me.
There, are you happy?
Yeah, that still doesn't explain your psychic ability.
Psychic?
Please.
I combine near-absolute data knowledge with fast Fourier neural nets for heuristics.
- Heuristics?
- Predictions using probability algorithms that are stored in my...
Look, are you sure you want to hear this?
Whatever you call it, you can tell the future.
I can see our future.
Yours and mine.
That's why I'm here, Max.
You getting the feeling that, uh, Puffy here's got something else on his mind than betraying the S1W?
Oh, but I didn't betray the S1W.
It was one of them.
Come on.
- I don't want to get out of town.
- Well, you don't have a choice.
They have photos of you now.
Fingerprints.
It's just a matter of time before they pick you up again.
This yours?
- Thanks.
- There's some personal stuff in there you might want to keep track of.
Address book... poems and things...
Come on.
What are you doing, Max?
S1W went down 'cause of him.
Or not.
That's what I'm thinking.
Don't worry
- I'll keep him on a short leash.
- Oh, it was nice seeing you again.
You're right about the S1W.
One of them's gotta be a police informant.
I mean, they free political prisoners, play Robin Hood, even get fingered for taking down Manticore, and the cops leave 'em alone.
Then they attack police corruption head-on and get nailed.
- Would you pay attention?
- I am.
What did I just say?
You were wondering what, if anything, is going on between blondie and you-know-who.
- Let's stick with who's the informant.
- I don't know who.
Well, I pulled up the arrest report from the police database, so just... do your thing.
Okay.
Well, that's the guy that got shot, so we know it's not him, unless... that's what we're supposed to think, and it is him.
All right, on this next one, could you be a little more - what was it - heuristic?
Ooh.
Yeah, she is gonna be a lot heavier than I am when she's thirty.
93% certainty.
- Did she turn them in?
- No idea.
- Okay, then.
This guy.
What about him?
I don't know who he is.
Max went out to get your address book and came back with some crazy guy she found who knows a lot about the S1W.
- Not a lot.
Everything.
- Max seems to think he's okay.
Yeah, well, Max wasn't turned in, was she?
- So what you're saying is none of them did it?
- Maybe all of them did it.
Or maybe not.
Look, I'm not optimized for this!
- It's okay.
We're finally together, and I'm letting you down.
You don't remember me at all, do you?
From back at Manticore?
That's all right.
I'm designed to be forgettable.
But I remember you, with your short hair, and your cammies, and - and you could blur in everything.
I used to watch you and your friends running around, just having a blast.
It was no blast.
Believe me.
When you broke out, leaving the rest of us behind...
I thought I was gonna die, I missed you so much.
- Look, Brain, we didn't know each other.
- I knew you.
They fed us data on all the X5's to predict battle behavior, and I stayed after every day, learning everything there was to know about you.
I knew you.
That data they fed you - it wasn't me.
I knew you'd come back to Manticore, and you did.
I knew you'd get involved the second S1W got into trouble.
That's why I'm here.
- What do you mean, that's why you're here?
I know you better than anyone, Max.
And I would do anything for you.
What I really need you to do... is tell me who the informant is.
Okay?
What?
There was a .05% chance that you were... gonna lean over and kiss me right then.
I was just... hoping.
Okay.
- Let's go.
If she's supposed to be on our side, then why's she protecting him?
- She's not protecting him.
- Then where is he?
Why don't we just concentrate on getting you guys out of town?
And why don't you call me when you get there.
You've got my number, right?
Who's he working for?
That's what I wanna know.
He's not working for anyone.
He saved your asses, if you wanna know the truth.
- Yeah?
Is that what he says?
- That's what I say.
You're blaming the wrong guy.
I think
- I think
- I think
- I think sector police will approach in a scatter "Y" formation.
Alpha team in the stairwell, bravo in the elevator.
Chances are dead even a third team will stake out the roof.
- What is he talking about?
- He turned us in again!
Shut up!
Egress through a fire stairwell.
Fifty-four steps up to the second floor.
There's an exhaust fan behind a four-foot grate in the west hallway.
Use it.
It's your only way out.
- When?
When's this happening?
- Now.
- Go!
Do what he says!
Get out of here!
You trust him, you lead the way.
I got one!
I think.
- Yeah.
- We're at the pickup point.
How you doing?
I'm off to the frozen north.
I don't know who to trust.
I'm not happy about this, Logan.
- Well, I'm not happy about it, either.
Well, if she's not happy, and you're not happy, then I'm not happy.
Max, are you happy?
Shut up!
No, not you.
There should be a loading ramp by the garage.
- Okay.
- A truck will back in at 4:05.
That's your ride to Canada.
Driver's a friend of Eyes Only.
He knows the entire situation.
He found him!
Detective Sung said Brain's in lockdown at twelfth precinct.
I'm gonna get him.
Did you hear that?
Big guy's in lockdown, so it's kind of hard to figure him for our police informant.
So until we know who is be careful.
You might want to keep your departure plans to yourself.
Logan, don't hang up yet.
It's just... are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.
You're gonna be fine.
Good luck.
Just stay in touch.
What in the world do they see in you?
- Oh, it's you.
- Spare me.
You knew I'd be coming for you.
Well, you must have been expecting someone, or did you think you could really slip through those bars?
- That's hurtful.
- Come on.
Let's get going.
The guard I stole this uniform off of won't be out forever.
What's with the ankle?
You know, while the cops were storming the place and you guys were all getting away,
I had this thought.
Oh, left.
Left.
Maybe people don't see me because there's nothing to see.
Are you sure this is the fastest way out?
What's the point of knowing everything but doing nothing about it?
I'm not seeing an exit anywhere soon.
Anyways, that's why I turned myself in.
You what?
!
I'm dying because you turned yourself in on purpose?
!
Well, I thought you were supposed to be strong!
I'm not Superwoman!
Oh, here.
Hurry!
Ooh, right there.
Look, they're coming.
Gently - gently - okay - oh - oof!
- Do you have any idea what the chance of this is?
- Of what?
You turning yourself in?
No.
Of you and me here, together... in this exact precinct... in this exact office... you wearing that uniform...
me and my sprained ankle... in this exact moment in space and time.
- Do you know what the chance is?
- Who knows - one in a trillion?
No.
It's a hundred percent.
We're here, right?
- Okay, I see where all this is going now.
- Where?
Where's it going?
You mean where are you going.
Because you're running running through a passageway, drawn onward by distant voices.
There's machinery... steam...
it's some kind of factory.
No, it's a sawmill.
Oh...
- What?
- You look so beautiful when you run.
What are the voices?
You said "drawn onward by distant voices".
- I said that? "Drawn onward"?
- That's what you said.
Well, okay then, you're drawn onward by distant voices... voices of the S1W being held captive by the traitor in their midst.
Okay, you descend a staircase into another passageway, headed for a door at the end.
There's a sign on the door.
It says...
What?
What does it say?
- "Drawn onward"?
Look, I really said that?
- What's the sign say?
Okay.
The sign, it says...
"Danger".
But because you're you, you don't stop.
Instead, you kick the door open...
What?
What happened?
- I don't know.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
What do you mean, nothing?
I mean, why did I take so long to find you?
Well, I don't buy any of it, anyway.
I mean, why am I supposed to believe you just happen to know all this?
How could anyone just happen to know all this?
Why do you think we're here?
- It's just like Asha's book.
- It's an old CIA trick.
- A poem?
- Not a poem.
A coded message, keyed to matching books.
That's how the informant's been communicating with the cops.
- What are you saying?
Asha's the traitor?
- Look at the bright side - at least she's not writing love poems to Logan.
No, it doesn't make any sense.
Betraying the S1W would hurt Logan.
She wouldn't do that.
Good point.
Musta been someone else's book you found.
Whose?
Beats me.
- Oh, you took my book.
- No, it ended up in my backpack somehow.
Lucky for me.
I was afraid I'd lost it.
- What does it say?
- "Oh, love, softness swelling"...
I mean decoded.
The traitor's the group leader, the guy who got shot.
He's dangerous, Max, so...
- I know. "Be careful".
I was gonna say why don't turn around and forget the whole thing?
We can live happily ever after.
That's 97% certain.
- Brain...
- Yeah?
Watch the hands.
- I'm just tryin' to hang on here.
- Hang on a little lower.
Not that low.
It's 4:05.
Time to move.
- Where?
- We got a ride to Canada.
Well, let's go, then.
- Wish me luck.
- Max, wait.
The poem you found in Asha's backpack...
- You mean the coded message.
Yeah, only you didn't know that at the time.
And you helped her anyway.
- How do I look?
- What do you mean?
How do I look?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Something that's gonna happen?
Well...
I never actually noticed before, but... kind of magnificent.
- Fall back!
Fall back!
- Freeze!
Stay where you are!
- This way!
Come on!
- Where are we going?
- This way.
- The gunfire stopped.
- There's more coming.
- How do you know that?
Just go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go!
Move!
Move!
'Cause you're running... running through a passageway, drawn onward by distant voices... voices of the S1W being held captive by the traitor in their midst.
You descend a staircase into another passageway, headed for a door at the end.
There's a sign on the door.
It says... "Danger."
Brain.
Shh, you'll be all right.
Egress through that door...
ninety-three feet.
Turn right.
Hurry.
Let's go.
- You saw this, didn't you?
- I saw you.
You saved me.
What are the chances?
You... me...
One hundred percent.
Max, I don't mind if no one else ever saw me.
I just wanted to be seen by you.
Clear the area.
Clear!
Brain.
Brain?
I got your message.
Is it true?
Yeah, it's true.
All the police files from the arrest are gone.
Your record's clean.
- So I can stay.
- You all can.
God, Logan, thanks.
Don't thank me.
Apparently a candy bar melted on the precinct system server.
Ruined all the data.
- Wow, what are the chances of that?
- According to Max, they're, uh...
- What?
- Better than you'd think.
So you wanna come along?
Tell the group the good news?
I'd promised someone I'd do them a favor.
Um, how 'bout if I meet you guys there later?
Uh, tell Max I'm sorry, okay?
About her friend?
Okay.
Jim, when shall I see you?
Where will you go?
I'll meet you at the manor after I've seen Frank.
- Take care of yourself, darling.
- I will.
It's bright and warm outside, thank goodness.
I'll be all right.
Do not attempt to adjust your set.
This is a streaming freedom video bulletin.
The cable hack will last exactly sixty seconds.
It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped...
I don't know how he stood it.
All that noise, I mean.
All around us, the battle rages - a battle between...
Why are you here?
- Never a welcoming word with you, is there, Max?
- Well?
- The courageous among us do not give up...
- Maybe, uh... maybe I wanted to come by and make sure you were okay.
Did you ever think of that?
The courageous among us are called more often than others to sacrifice.
A great and fearless warrior in this battle died today...
- "Great and fearless warrior"?
- It doesn't matter what they say.
I just want people to see him.
- Overlooked in his lifetime by all of us...
Why are you here?
- Like I said.
- You sold his TV's, didn't you?
No, not all of them.
I'm gonna keep one for myself.
- You're moving in?
- Well, Max, it's not like he needs the place anymore.
You know, I never really noticed, but he's actually kind of magnificent.
Yeah.
He was.
I'm your destiny.
Stop it.
Please stop it.
- Yeah!
- Where are you?
- Are you Okay?
- Why, What happened?
Things have blown up about your underage sex scandal articles.
We've got calls threatening you if you don't stop writing them.
I've gotten them too.
We were ready for that.
Still, be careful.
For the next feature story.
Let's try some of that paranormal stuff you were talking about last year.
I told you this was the last article.
I'm changing my cell number and disappearing tomorrow.
Ji-Won!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The sacred look, so sexy.
Who is this?
You can't be that scared.
We've only just begun.
Who are you?
There's no rush.
We'll meet soon enough.
Hello.
Where are you off to so fast?
It won't help to run.
You bastard!
If you've got something to say come and face me.
Don't cover your voice and hide like a rat.
Why aren't you following, rat?
Is this Ji-Won's phone?
Oh, Ho Jung.
So?
Do you know who it is?
It's probably one of the guys... from the sex scandal articles.
The justice system will take care of them.
I'll just go away and finish writing that novel.
What if he really comes after you?
Have you decided where to go?
No, I'm still thinking.
You ought to go to Bang Bae.
Our new house is empty.
I bought it about a year ago.
It's too big.
We'll move in there when Young-Ju gets a little bigger.
It's well-furnished I think you will love it.
What do you think?
Thanks a lot.
Ho Jung, is that okay?
Honey, do you think.
It's okay to be alone there?
It's dangerous.
It's not dangerous.
I've had a security system installed.
But I'm still worried.
This is great.
I'm sorry.
I should stay with you but Young-Ju's asleep.
Will you be okay?
Aren't you scared?
I'm not a little kid.
Don't worry.
I'll be fine.
I'm just worried.
Which room should I use?
Use my bedroom.
It's the most comfortable.
It's so big.
I'm a little uneasy.
And it's for you and your husband.
I'll take the room at the end of the hall upstairs.
That room?
No, it's full of junk.
It's a storage room.
I'll clean it up.
You guys go and get some rest.
OK, I'll lock up.
I'll call you tomorrow.
He doesn't quit.
Now what is it?
Now what?
What's this?
That's weird.
That's never happened before.
What?
It only gives one number.
Hello?
You drive well.
I'm sorry.
You'll need to go to another branch?
I think it's fate.
Just give me that number.
The girl in the picture is Modigliani's daughter.
He painted it when his wife was pregnant.
He painted it after watching.
Thinking about their unborn daughter.
They must have been happy.
I want...
Young-Ju to grow up like that...
In a perfect family.
You ought to paint again.
You have the perfect family.
You're wasting your talent.
I don't think I could take care of the family and paint right now.
I'm satisfied just enjoying other's art.
Sorry about that.
Is it him again?
No.
Since I changed my cell number I shouldn't get any more those calls.
What's the number?
This is Renoir's Irene Cahen d'Anvers.
Young-Ju
Young-Ju
Give us the phone.
Give me the phone.
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
Give us the phone.
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
You're worried, aren't you?
Whatever she heard on the phone must have scared her.
I don't think it was the stalker but it's weird.
Anyway call me if you go to the doctor tomorrow.
Sure I will.
Stop it.
It hurts my ears.
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong.
Is she okay?
She's just stressed from whatever scared her.
Give her some time.
She'll be fine.
Since you changed your number you've had 2 calls.
Your friend Ho Jung and me.
That's not right.
I've had three strange calls since then.
There are two possibilities.
The phone company's records are messed up... or the stalker knows... how to block the calls from showing up.
Those sex scandal guys.
Will be on trial in a few days.
It's probably one of them.
But be careful.
Here's a present.
You really think this is going to help?
Hit them once and they're out.
The men involved in the underage sex scandal have been identified.
It's shocking that one of them.
Dr. Cha, is a psychiatrist.
A Miss Jung has testified that Dr. Cha... repeatedly demanded perverted sex.
Hello.
So, who the hell are you?
Hello?
What do you mean?
Slow down now.
What are you going to tell?
You're going to catch cold.
Studying is hard, isn't it?
A faint rose smell.
I love that faint flower fragrance.
Now, which way?
I love you more than anything.
If you're hurting then I hurt too.
So don't be hurting anymore, okay?
Hurting anymore, okay?
You're such a strong woman.
I thought you'd give up... when the doctor said you couldn't get pregnant.
But with that artificial program you did it.
When I think of that time.
I still feel faint.
Do you know how nervous I get... watching you go from crisis to crisis?
What would I do without you?
I couldn't have done it without you.
- Young-Ju
- Daddy.
I'm scared.
Ji-Won!
What do you think she heard?
I was so scared.
It started after... she answer my phone in the museum, didn't it?
I checked the phone records but there's nothing there.
Ji-Won.
How about changing your number again?
Then he can't call.
Hello?
Hey, Chang-Hoon!
What's up?
Yeah, just a minute.
It's Chang-Hoon.
Hi, honey.
You're getting big.
Young-Ju.
Do you remember what you heard on my phone?
No.
Aunt!
Do you know what love is?
Love?
Do you know love?
No, you wouldn't know... what real love is.
You're in love with somebody.
Who is it?
Daddy.
So, you said you love your Daddy.
What about your Mommy?
Do you love her?
Don't you love your mommy?
You're tired.
Go to sleep.
Aunt!
If...
That woman calls again tell her not to yell.
It scares me.
You don't look good.
Is it the phone calls?
Did you find anything?
There is no record of a call coming in on your cell at that time.
Even the department at a phone company tracking the calls has no idea.
Are we at a dead end?
This is what I've found.
People who've had that number.
Nothing strange in their background.
But you know... both people that had that number died.
One in a car wreck the other a heart attack.
It's not necessarily murder... but it is strange.
Finish eating and let's make Daddy a card.
I've got everything ready.
A Christmas card?
Yeah.
- Who is it?
- Flower Delivery.
What is it?
Daddy sent them.
Sorry for not helping out lately.
I love you!
Eat it.
I said eat it.
Eat it.
Young-Ju.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Young-Ju?
What's wrong with you?
He worked hard driving his taxi and... he talked about his dream of opening a restaurant.
Then his wife bought that cell phone.
I don't know if it was the phone that killed him.
The cell phone?
He said that after he got the cell phone he started getting weird calls.
Nobody talking!
Just a bone chilling sound!
It was like his soul was gone.
One day, he said he wouldn't do night duty.
I asked him why and he said something about a ghost.
What caused the wreck?
Here it is.
Bang Bae?
Ho Jung!
What's going on?
She has an unusually strong desire to be with her father.
The long hair represents her... as an adult thinking sexually of her father.
She gets jealous when you and your husband get intimate... and she doesn't want to leave her Dad.
Is she trying to push me away?
At her age it's just a temporary thing.
You mean there is anything else wrong with her?
No.
Developmentally and health-wise she's fine.
You have a very intelligent little girl.
Let's do it again.
Se-se-se...
Wouldn't it be great if I were on TV?
If I were on TV?
Anyway she lived alone.
For some reason she came home after midnight every night.
Before she died you should have seen her face.
You know it was ghostly white.
Was it suicide?
Who commits suicide in an elevator?
They said it was a heart attack caused by some mental fit.
She asked me to call when they got a trial date.
Is she already asleep?
What's this?
Hey?
Are you okay?
One winter day, a certain queen was sewing by the window.
Then the queen pricked her finger with her needle.
Three drops of blood fell into the snow.
The red on the white looked so beautiful, that she thought...
"If only I had a child as white as snow as red as blood..."
and as black as this frame ...and they lived happily ever after.
Yeah, right!
Shit!
We grow up with this crap that's why... we have little stupid princesses around.
What a stupid story!
Detective?
Get away he need surgery.
I told you not mess with me.
You started all this.
You're crazy.
How does it feel to be hanging by a thread?
Beg me to save you.
What's the matter?
Why's the fridge open?
You're going to make yourself sick.
Stop worrying.
The Doctor said she'd be fine.
Let's wait a while.
If she gets worse we can admit her.
I don't want her admitted.
I'm sorry.
My little princess is awake.
Give me a kiss.
Young-Ju.
Young-Ju?
Young-Ju.
What's wrong with you?
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju What's are you doing?
Hi!
You're good on the piano.
You are already on the Moonlight Sonata?
The Moonlight Sonata?
That song you play every night.
My Mom doesn't let me play at night.
That's strange!
My Mom say the music comes from your house.
Anybody home?
She had two cell numbers?
But there was only 1 phone.
I didn't know it until she was gone.
Her number was 9726-6644.
When we couldn't find her.
I cancelled the 9998-6644 number.
I kept her number to keep hope alive.
There were a lot of rumors when Jin-Hee disappeared.
She ran away with a boyfriend.
She worked at a bar "She was a stripteaser"
But one day... they said she got killed... and come back to haunt the school.
Where did that come from?
We heard piano music in an empty concert hall at night.
A teacher went in but nobody was there.
We could hear the piano off and on.
The Moonlight Sonata?
How did you know that?
She was practicing that song before she disappeared.
Sang Mi had some weird stuff happen, too.
She passed out on the bathroom floor with a cell phone next to her.
Everybody said it was Jin-Hee calling from the dead.
Now everybody's scared of cell phones.
Okay all phones on your desks.
Be quiet.
Sang Mi that does it.
Sang Mi.
Get up here.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Jin-Hee was the first to have my phone number.
And she gave it to somebody.
I'm sure.
It's a guy.
What proof do you have?
I heard stuff on my phone I didn't understand it all but... she was mad at some guy.
When she disappeared... her Mom cancelled the number.
The next two people who got that number died strange deaths.
I'm sure that guy has something to do with her disappearance... or maybe he...
Are you saying she was murdered?
And her spirit is in Young-Ju?
Dose that make sense to you?
But, Jin-Hee...
Ji-Won you're not helping out saying this crap.
Honey!
Sorry!
Your mother said she found a good child psychologist.
Let's get Young-Ju some treatment... and she'll be fine.
Ji-Won enough of this phone... and Jin-Hee talk, okay?
But Young-Ju could be in trouble.
- We've got to find out why.
- The doctor will find out.
Stay out of our business.
I'll pretend.
I didn't hear you.
Hey!
Hold still I'm trying.
Look how tiny she is.
Thank a lot!
If it weren't for you we wouldn't have Young-Ju.
If you hadn't provided the eggs...
No problem but...
I thought we weren't going to tell anyone.
When I asked you...
I was worried you'd refuse.
I think of her as my own.
Just raise her to be as beautiful as you, deal?
Let's do it.
The voice you heard on the phone was Jin-Hee's.
The voice of said disturbed Jin-Hee.
You're right.
Your number was hers.
She was excited she has two phones with the same last digits.
She said she was giving one to somebody she loved.
She looked... real happy.
If you asked who he was she'd say it's a secret.
She'd disappear after school.
She wanted to hang out with me so she could brag about him.
I don't know who he was but... she liked him a lot.
He liked the Moonlight Sonata... so she asked me to teach her.
She wasn't good but she practiced very hard.
What's wrong with me?
You have no feeling.
You're not going to get him like that.
Here watch me.
You try it.
One day he started avoiding her calls.
Let's go in.
Come on.
Let's go.
You go in.
You're going to be tardy.
I said you go in.
Love you please answer.
Does that make love last?
Of course just like that.
Tell us more.
Take the letters in your name and add them to the guy's name...
See it's 10.
Them, send him this message.
I'm your destiny at 10 minutes after the hour.
But if I send it he'll know my number.
I'm not through.
You punch in his number not yours.
I'll have to try it.
By the way who's this guy?
Leonardo DiCaprio.
Really?
How did you get his phone number?
Hey, would you shut up I can't sleep.
What the matter with her?
Stupid bitch!
You got dumped.
So, now you're writing?
He hasn't called for several days.
I sit by the phone all day long.
Forget what you saw... or I'll kill you.
I don't know how to get away from her.
But if you don't want to become... like the taxi driver or that girl... don't answer the phone... and don't look at the phone.
Sis!
You didn't come also, did you?
Jin-Hee...
Jin-Hee came with you didn't she?
LOVE
You're going to catch cold.
I like this music.
You don't like it, do you?
No!
It's good.
This phone's last 4 digits are the same as mine.
I'll cal you on it nobody else can answer it though.
And I'm the only one that can call it.
I'm sorry.
I told you not to carry this handkerchief.
How could you bring it when you're coming to see me?
I'm sorry, I forgot.
You forgot?
You take care of everything she gives you... and forget your promise to me?
What, she made it so you think it's wonderful?
What?
Does that upset you?
Jin-Hee.
We probably shouldn't meet.
For a while.
Is that up to you?
She came back from my in-laws.
You're making it worse.
I'm sorry.
You can keep the handkerchief.
I can wait for a few days.
Just don't say I can't see you.
I love you.
I couldn't live without you.
He wavered for a moment but... this will pass.
I believe in our love.
What went on with Jin-Hee?
If you don't come clean... what's going to happen to Young-Ju?
There's no time.
If you don't tell.
I'm going to.
It'll save Young-Ju.
Hi, Ho Jung.
Young-Ju's gone.
I don't know what to do.
What do you mean she's gone?
I gave her some medicine and put her to bed.
I fell asleep too and when I woke up she was gone.
Who is this?
Who is this?
That's enough.
What exactly do you want?
Chang-Hoon's the one who did you wrong.
Leave Young-Ju alone.
What do you hope to gain from this?
He wavered for a moment but this will pass
I believe in our love.
Where is Young-Ju?
- Be careful!
- Young-Ju!
I'm coming.
- Just stay there.
- Young-Ju!
Young-Ju.
Young-Ju.
I'm sick of that.
That make me real sick!
Which one of you would like to die for me?
Well, speak up.
Young-Ju!
No!
Young-Ju!
Dangerous!
Jin-Hee!
It's Daddy!
Where?
That's Daddy, isn't it?
Isn't that Daddy?
That's not him.
He's at the office now.
I'm at the park now I'll be here until you come.
No night school tonight.
I want to see you.
Why are you avoiding me?
I'm going to tell everything.
Don't you want to see me?
I really want to see you.
I am going to your office tomorrow.
I'm four weeks along.
I'm pregnant.
What's up?
I was in the area.
You're busy I'm probably just bothering you.
So, you're going to remodel the Bang Bae house by yourself?
Are you gonna be okay?
We're not moving for a while there's no hurry.
Yeah?
I need to go to Japan on business tomorrow.
I'll be gone about 4 days.
I know you haven't been back long I'm so sorry.
Are you?
That's okay.
Let's meet at the park now.
The phone is turned off so leave your message at the voice mall.
You will be charged after the beep.
At your age you could fall for a kind, older man... but he's not as simple as you.
Men and girls are different.
Don't mistake me for a child.
You'll find somebody better than him.
I don't need anybody else.
He'll come back to his family.
You hope.
Let's get real.
Abort the baby.
How can you be responsible for a baby in High School?
Nobody will take care of that baby.
I'm not asking you to.
I'm having the baby.
It's my baby made with the one I love.
You wouldn't understand because you borrowed an egg.
You share nothing with him.
You're in fantasyland.
If he really loved you why won't he take your calls?
Don't you get it?
No.
He loves me.
Do you want me to tell you how much we've loved?
We make love here everyday while you were gone.
He said
He's the happiest person to be with me.
You only look good on the outside.
Do you how much you smother him?
You think you can create love.
Do you know how sick he is of you?
I'm not like you.
His love... his baby...
I can take everything.
That's enough.
Please leave him.
Then I'll give you anything you want.
Anything I want?
Divorce him.
Do you think he loves you?
Get real!
You're the one in fantasyland.
The woman he loves is me.
You want me to prove he loves me?
You're dead.
Ji-Won!
You remember...
When I found out I couldn't get pregnant and...
I just wanted to die?
When I'd see children on the street...
I wanted to grab one and run away.
If I even saw a pregnant woman...
I would cry... until my eyes felt like falling out.
When I'd open my eyes in the morning.
The world would be like shattered glass.
It was you that gave me strength.
But do you know... how jealous I get when you look into Young-Ju's eyes?
Like...
She's going to see you as her mother.
She's mine.
I carried her for 9 months I suffered having her, she's mine.
I would do anything for her to be happy, anything.
I...
I will do everything.
If she is happy.
No, I can do everything.
I can...
You're so wrong.
Jin-Hee didn't deserve to die.
You killed her for revenge.
Let's say you cover everything up.
What about Young-Ju?
You think Young-Ju will be happy?
Like before?
Shut up!
She's mine and I'll raise her so she'll never know.
If you just keep your mouth shut.
That's enough.
Look at her.
Don't you understand?
Not only Young-Ju.
But you're in danger, too.
Let's see he kills you... when he finds out Jin-Hee is dead.
Then he feels bad about it and kills himself!
I'm your destiny
Stop it!
Please stop it!
- Yeah!
- Where are you?
- Are you okay?
- Why, what happened?
Things have blown up about your underage sex scandal articles
We've got calls threatening you if you don't stop writing them
I've gotten them too We were ready for that
Still, be careful
For the next feature story let's try some of that paranormal stuff you were talking about last year
I told you this was the last article
I'm changing my cell number and disappearing tomorrow
Ji-Won!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The scared look, so sexy
Who is this?
You can't be that scared
We've only just begun
Who are you?
There's no rush.
We'll meet soon enough.
Hello.
Where are you off to so fast?
It won't help to run.
You bastard!
If you've got something to say come and face me.
Don't cover your voice and hide like a rat.
Why aren't you following, rat?
Is this Ji-Won's phone?
Oh, Ho Jung.
So?
Do you know who it is?
It's probably one of the guys... from the sex scandal articles
The justice system will take care of them
I'll just go away and finish writing that novel
What if he really comes after you?
Have you decided where to go?
No, I'm still thinking.
You ought to go to Bang Bae.
Our new house is empty.
I bought it about a year ago.
It's too big.
We'll move in there when Young-Ju gets a little bigger.
It's well-furnished, I think you will love it
What do you think?
Thanks a lot.
Ho Jung, is that okay?
Honey, do you think it's okay to be alone there?
It's dangerous.
It's not dangerous.
I've had a security system installed.
But I'm still worried.
This is great.
I'm sorry.
I should stay with you but Young-Ju's asleep.
Will you be okay?
Aren't you scared?
I'm not a little kid.
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm just worried.
Which room should I use?
Use my bedroom.
It's the most comfortable.
It's so big.
I'm a little uneasy.
And it's for you and your husband.
I'll take the room at the end of the hall upstairs.
That room?
No, it's full of junk.
It's a storage room.
I'll clean it up.
You guys go and get some rest.
Ok, I'll lock up.
I'll call you tomorrow.
He doesn't quit.
Now what is it?
Now what?
What's this?
That's weird.
That's never happened before.
What?
It only gives one number.
Hello?
You drive well.
I'm sorry.
You'll need to go to another branch.
I think it's fate.
Just give me that number.
The girl in the picture is Modigliani's daughter.
He painted it when his wife was pregnant.
He painted it after watching.
Thinking about their unborn daughter.
They must have been happy.
I want...
Young-Ju to grow up like that... in a perfect family.
You ought to paint again.
You have the perfect family.
You're wasting your talent.
I don't think I could take care of the family and paint right now.
I'm satisfied just enjoying other's art.
Sorry about that.
Is it him again?
No.
Since I changed my cell number I shouldn't get any more those calls.
What's the number?
This is Renoir's Irene Cahen d'Anvers.
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju.
Give us the phone.
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
Give us the phone.
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
You're worried, aren't you?
Whatever she heard on the phone must have scared her.
I don't think it was the stalker, but it's weird.
Anyway call me if you go to the doctor tomorrow.
Sure I will...
Stop it.
It hurts my ears.
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong.
Is she okay?
She's just stressed from whatever scared her.
Give her some time.
She'll be fine.
Since you changed your number you've had two calls.
Your friend Ho Jung and me.
That's not right.
I've had three strange calls since then.
There are two possibilities:
the phone company's records are messed up... or the stalker knows... how to block the calls from showing up
Those sex scandal guys.
will be on trial in a few days.
It's probably one of them.
But be careful.
Here's a present.
You really think this is going to help?
Hit them once and they're out.
The men involved in the underage sex scandal have been identified.
It's shocking that one of them
Dr. Cha, is a psychiatrist.
A Miss Jung has testified that Dr. Cha... repeatedly demanded perverted sex.
Hello.
So, who the hell are you?
Hello?
What do you mean?
Slow down now.
What are you going to tell?
You're going to catch a cold.
Studying is hard, isn't it?
A faint rose smell.
I love that faint flower fragrance.
Now, which way?
I love you more than anything.
If you're hurting then I hurt too.
So don't be hurting anymore, okay? You're such a strong woman
I thought you'd give up... when the doctor said you couldn't get pregnant.
But with that artificial insemination program you did it.
When I think of that time
I still feel faint.
Do you know how nervous I get... watching you go from crisis to crisis?
What would I do without you?
I couldn't have done it without you.
- Young-Ju!
- Daddy, I'm scared
Ji-Won!
What do you think she heard?
I was so scared.
It started after... she answered my phone in the museum, didn't it?
I checked the phone records but there's nothing there
Ji-Won
How about changing your number again?
Then he can't call
Hello?
Hey, Chang-Hoon!
What's up?
Yeah, just a minute.
It's Chang-Hoon
Hi, honey.
You're getting big.
Young-Ju, do you remember what you heard on my phone?
No.
Aunt!
Do you know what love is?
Love?
Do you know love?
No, you wouldn't know... what real love is.
You're in love with somebody...
Who is it?
Daddy
So, you said you love your Daddy
What about your Mommy?
Do you love her?
Don't you love your mommy?
You're tired.
Go to sleep.
Aunt!
If... that woman calls again tell her not to yell,
it scares me.
You don't look good.
Is it the phone calls?
Did you find anything?
There is no record of a call coming in on your cell at that time
Even the department at a phone company tracking the calls has no idea.
Are we at a dead end?
This is what I've found.
People who've had that number.
Nothing strange in their background.
But you know... both people that had that number died.
One in a car wreck, the other had a heart attack.
It's not necessarily murder... but it is strange.
Finish eating and let's make Daddy a card.
I've got everything ready.
A Christmas card?
Yeah.
- Who is it?
- Flower Delivery.
What is it?
Daddy sent them.
Sorry for not helping out lately.
I love you!
Eat it.
I said eat it!
Eat it.
Young-Ju, what's the matter?
Nothing.
Young-Ju?
What's wrong with you?
He worked hard driving his taxi and... he talked about his dream of opening a restaurant.
Then his wife bought that cell phone.
I don't know if it was the phone that killed him
The cell phone?
He said that after he got the cell phone he started getting weird calls.
Nobody talking!
Just a bone chilling sound!
It was like his soul was gone.
One day, he said he wouldn't do night duty.
I asked him why and he said something about a ghost.
What caused the wreck?
Here it is.
Bang Bae?
Ho Jung!
What's going on?
She has an unusually strong desire to be with her father.
The long hair represents her... as an adult thinking sexually of her father.
She gets jealous when you and your husband get intimate... and she doesn't want to leave her Dad.
Is she trying to push me away?
At her age it's just a temporary thing
You mean there is anything else wrong with her?
No
Developmentally and health-wise she's fine.
You have a very intelligent little girl.
Let's do it again.
Se-se-se...
Wouldn't it be great if I was on TV, if I was on TV?
Anyway she lived alone.
For some reason she came ho.me after midnight every night
Before she died you should have seen her face.
You know, it was ghostly white.
Was it suicide?
Who commits suicide in an elevator?
They said it was a heart attack caused by some mental fit.
She asked me to call when they got a trial date.
Is she already asleep?
What's this?
Hey?
Are you okay?
One winter day, a certain queen was sewing by the window.
Then the queen pricked her finger with her needle.
Three drops of blood fell into the snow.
The red on the white looked so beautiful, that she thought...
"If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood..."
and as black as this frame and they lived happily ever after
Yeah, right!
Shit!
We grow up with this crap that's why... we have little stupid princesses around.
What a stupid story!
Detective?
Get away, he needs surgery!
I told you not to mess with me.
You started all this.
You're crazy.
How does it feel to be hanging by a thread?
Beg me to save you.
What's the matter?
Why's the fridge open?
You're going to make yourself sick.
Stop worrying.
The doctor said she'd be fine.
Let's wait a while.
If she gets worse we can admit her.
I don't want her admitted.
I'm sorry.
My little princess is awake.
Give me a kiss.
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju?
Young-Ju What's wrong with you?
Young-Ju?
Young-Ju What are you doing?
Hi!
You're good on the piano.
You are already on the Moonlight Sonata?
The Moonlight sonata?
That song you play every night.
My Mom doesn't let me play at night.
That's strange!
My Mom says the music comes from your house.

What?
Does that upset you?
Jin-Hee.
We probably shouldn't meet for a while.
Is that up to you?

You're making it worse.

- Just stay there.
- Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
I'm sick of that.
That makes me real sick!
Which one of you would like to die for me?
Well, speak up.
Young-Ju!
No!
Young-Ju!
Dangerous!
Jin-Hee!
It's daddy!
Where?
That's daddy, isn't it?
Isn't that daddy?
That's not him.
He's at the office now.
I'm at the park now.
I'll be here until you come.
No night school tonight.
I want to see you.
Why are you avoiding me?
I'm going to tell everything.
Don't you want to see me?
I really want to see you.
I am going to your office tomorrow.
I'm four weeks along.
I'm pregnant.
What's up?
I was in the area.
You're busy.
I'm probably just bothering you.
So, you're going to remodel the Bang Bae house by yourself?
Are you gonna be okay?
We're not moving for a while, there's no hurry.
Yeah?
I need to go to Japan on business tomorrow.
I'll be gone about 4 days.
I know you haven't been back long.
I'm so sorry.
Are you?
That's okay.
Let's meet at the park now.
The phone is turned off so leave your message at the voice mail.
You will be charged after the beep.
At your age you could fall for a kind, older man... but he's not as simple as you.
Men and girls are different.
Don't mistake me for a child.
You'll find somebody better than him.
I don't need anybody else.
He'll come back to his family.
You hope.
Let's get real, abort the baby.
How can you be responsible for a baby in High School?
Nobody will take care of that baby.
I'm not asking you to.
I'm having the baby.
It's my baby, made with the one I love.
You wouldn't understand, because you borrowed an egg.
You share nothing with him.
You're in fantasyland.
If he really loved you why won't he take your calls?
Don't you get it?
No.
He loves me.
Do you want me to tell you how much we've loved?
We made love here everyday while you were gone.
He said he's the happiest person to be with me.
You only look good on the outside.
Do you how much you smother him?
You think you can create love.
Do you know how sick he is of you?
I'm not like you.
His love... his baby...
I can take everything.
That's enough.
Please leave him.
Then I'll give you anything you want.
Anything I want?
Divorce him.
Do you think he loves you?
Get real!
You're the one in fantasyland.
The woman he loves is me.
You want me to prove he loves me?
You're dead.
Ji-Won!
You remember... when I found out I couldn't get pregnant and...
I just wanted to die?
When I'd see children on the street...
I wanted to grab one and run away.
If I even saw a pregnant woman...
I would cry... until my eyes felt like falling out.
When I'd open my eyes in the morning
The world would be like shattered glass.
It was you that gave me strength.
But do you know... how jealous I get when you look into Young-Ju's eyes?
Like... she's going to see you as her mother.
She's mine.
I carried her for 9 months.
I suffered having her, she's mine.
I would do anything for her to be happy, anything.
I...
I will do everything if she is happy.
No, I can do everything.
I can...
You're so wrong.
Jin-Hee didn't deserve to die.
You killed her for revenge.
Let's say you cover everything up.
What about Young-Ju?
You think Young-Ju will be happy?
Like before?
Shut up!
She's mine.
and I'll raise her, so she'll never know
if you just keep your mouth shut.
That's enough!
Look at her.
Don't you understand?
Not only Young-Ju, but you're in danger, too.
Let's see...he kills you... when he finds out Jin-Hee is dead.
Then he feels bad about it, and kills himself!
I'm your destiny
Stop it!
Please stop it!
- Yeah!
- Where are you?
- Are you okay?
- Why, what happened?
Things have blown up about your underage sex scandal articles
We've got calls threatening you if you don't stop writing them
I've gotten them too We were ready for that
Still, be careful
For the next feature story let's try some of that paranormal stuff you were talking about last year
I told you this was the last article
I'm changing my cell number and disappearing tomorrow
Ji-Won!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The scared look, so sexy
Who is this?
You can't be that scared
We've only just begun
Who are you?
There's no rush We'll meet soon enough
Hello
Where are you off to so fast?
It won't help to run
You bastard!
If you've got something to say come and face me
Don't cover your voice and hide like a rat
Why aren't you following, rat?
Is this Ji-Won's phone?
Oh, Ho Jung
So?
Do you know who it is?
It's probably one of the guys... from the sex scandal articles
The justice system will take care of them
I'll just go away and finish writing that novel
What if he really comes after you?
Have you decided where to go?
No, I'm still thinking
You ought to go to Bang Bae
Our new house is empty
I bought it about a year ago.
It's too big
We'll move in there when Young-Ju gets a little bigger
It's well-furnished I think you will love it
What do you think?
Thanks a lot
Ho Jung, is that okay?
Honey, do you think it's okay to be alone there?
It's dangerous
It's not dangerous
I've had a security system installed
But I'm still worried
This is great
I'm sorry
I should stay with you but Young-Ju's asleep
Will you be okay?
Aren't you scared?
I'm not a little kid
Don't worry I'll be fine
I'm just worried
Which room should I use?
Use my bedroom It's the most comfortable
It's so big I'm a little uneasy
And it's for you and your husband
I'll take the room at the end of the hall upstairs
That room?
No, it's full of junk
It's a storage room
I'll clean it up
You guys go and get some rest Ok, I'll lock up
I'll call you tomorrow
He doesn't quit
Now what is it?
Now what?
What's this?
That's weird
That's never happened before
What?
It only gives one number
Hello?
You drive well
I'm sorry
You'll need to go to another branch
I think it's fate
Just give me that number
The girl in the picture is Modigliani's daughter
He painted it when his wife was pregnant
He painted it after watching
Thinking about their unborn daughter they must have been happy
I want...
Young-Ju to grow up like that... in a perfect family
You ought to paint again
You have the perfect family
You're wasting your talent
I don't think I could take care of the family and paint right now
I'm satisfied just enjoying other's art
Sorry about that
Is it him again?
No
Since I changed my cell number I shouldn't get any more those calls
What's the number?
This is Renoir's Irene Cahen d'Anvers
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju
Give us the phone
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
Give us the phone.
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
You're worried, aren't you?
Whatever she heard on the phone must have scared her
I don't think it was the stalker but it's weird
Anyway call me if you go to the doctor tomorrow
Sure I will...
Stop it
It hurts my ears
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong
Is she okay?
She's just stressed from whatever scared her
Give her some time
She'll be fine
Since you changed your number you've had 2 calls
Your friend Ho Jung and me
That's not right
I've had three strange calls since then
There are two possibilities
The phone company's records are messed up... or the stalker knows... how to block the calls from showing up
Those sex scandal guys will be on trial in a few days
It's probably one of them
But be careful
Here's a present
You really think this is going to help?
Hit them once and they're out
The men involved in the underage sex scandal have been identified
It's shocking that one of them
Dr. Cha, is a psychiatrist
A Miss Jung has testified that Dr. Cha... repeatedly demanded perverted sex
Hello
So, who the hell are you?
Hello?
What do you mean?
Slow down now
What are you going to tell?
You're going to catch cold
Studying is hard, isn't it?
A faint rose smell
I love that faint flower fragrance
Now, which way?
I love you more than anything
If you're hurting then I hurt too
So don't be hurting anymore, okay?
hurting anymore, okay?
You're such a strong woman
I thought you'd give up... when the doctor said you couldn't get pregnant
But with that artificial program you did it
When I think of that time
I still feel faint
Do you know how nervous I get... watching you go from crisis to crisis?
What would I do without you?
I couldn't have done it without you
- Young-Ju!
- Daddy, I'm scared
Ji-Won!
What do you think she heard?
I was so scared
It started after... she answered my phone in the museum, didn't it?
I checked the phone records but there's nothing there
Ji-Won
How about changing your number again?
Then he can't call
Hello?
Hey, Chang-Hoon!
What's up?
Yeah, just a minute
It's Chang-Hoon
Hi, honey
You're getting big
Young-Ju
Do you remember what you heard on my phone?
No
Aunt!
Do you know what love is?
Love?
Do you know love?
No, you wouldn't know... what real love is
You're in love with somebody
Who is it?
Daddy
So, you said you love your Daddy
What about your Mommy?
Do you love her?
Don't you love your mommy?
You're tired
Go to sleep
Aunt!
If... that woman calls again tell her not to yell
It scares me
You don't look good
Is it the phone calls?
Did you find anything?
There is no record of a call coming in on your cell at that time
Even the department at a phone company tracking the calls has no idea
Are we at a dead end?
This is what I've found
People who've had that number
Nothing strange in their background
But you know... both people that had that number died
One in a car wreck the other a heart attack
It's not necessarily murder... but it is strange
Finish eating and let's make Daddy a card
I've got everything ready
A Christmas card?
Yeah
- Who is it?
- Flower Delivery
What is it?
Daddy sent them
Sorry for not helping out lately I love you!
Eat it
I said eat it!
Eat it
Young-Ju what's the matter?
Nothing
Young-Ju?
What's wrong with you?
He worked hard driving his taxi and... he talked about his dream of opening a restaurant
Then his wife bought that cell phone
I don't know if it was the phone that killed him
The cell phone?
He said that after he got the cell phone he started getting weird calls
Nobody talking!
Just a bone chilling sound!
It was like his soul was gone
One day, he said he wouldn't do night duty
I asked him why and he said something about a ghost
What caused the wreck?
Here it is
Bang Bae?
Ho Jung!
What's going on?
She has an unusually strong desire to be with her father
The long hair represents her... as an adult thinking sexually of her father
She gets jealous when you and your husband get intimate... and she doesn't want to leave her Dad
Is she trying to push me away?
At her age it's just a temporary thing
You mean there is anything else wrong with her?
No
Developmentally and health-wise she's fine
You have a very intelligent little girl
Let's do it again
Se-se-se...
Wouldn't it be great if I were on TV if I were on TV?
Anyway she lived alone
For some reason she came home after midnight every night
Before she died you should have seen her face
You know it was ghostly white
Was it suicide?
Who commits suicide in an elevator?
They said it was a heart attack caused by some mental fit
She asked me to call when they got a trial date
Is she already asleep?
What's this?
Hey?
Are you okay?
One winter day, a certain queen was sewing by the window
Then the queen pricked her finger with her needle
Three drops of blood fell into the snow
The red on the white looked so beautiful, that she thought...
"If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood..."
and as black as this frame ...and they lived happily ever after
Yeah, right!
Shit!
We grow up with this crap that's why... we have little stupid princesses around
What a stupid story!
Detective?
Get away he needs surgery
I told you not to mess with me
You started all this
You're crazy
How does it feel to be hanging by a thread?
Beg me to save you
What's the matter?
Why's the fridge open?
You're going to make yourself sick
Stop worrying The doctor said she'd be fine
Let's wait a while
If she gets worse we can admit her
I don't want her admitted
I'm sorry
My little princess is awake
Give me a kiss
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju?
Young-Ju What's wrong with you?
Young-Ju?
Young-Ju What's are you doing?
Hi!
You're good on the piano You are already on the Moonlight Sonata?
The Moonlight sonata?
That song you play every night
My Mom doesn't let me play at night
That's strange!
My Mom says the music comes from your house
Anybody home?
She had two cell numbers?
But there was only 1 phone
I didn't know it until she was gone
Her number was 9726-6644
When we couldn't find her
I cancelled the 9998-6644 number
I kept her number to keep hope alive
There were a lot of rumors when Jin-Hee disappeared
She ran away with a boyfriend
She worked at a bar "She was a stripteaser."
But one day... they said she got killed... and came back to haunt the school
Where did that come from?
We heard piano music in an empty concert hall at night
A teacher went in but nobody was there
We could hear the piano off and on
The Moonlight Sonata?
How'd you know that?
She was practicing that song before she disappeared
Sang Mi had some weird stuff happen, too
She passed out on the bathroom floor with a cell phone next to her
Everybody said it was Jin-Hee calling from the dead
Now everybody's scared of cell phones
Okay all phones on your desks
Be quiet
Sang Mi that does it
Sang Mi Get up here
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Jin-Hee was the first to have my phone number
And she gave it to somebody
I'm sure it's a guy
What proof do you have?
I heard stuff on my phone I didn't understand it all but... she was mad at some guy
When she disappeared... her Mom cancelled the number
The next two people who got that number died strange deaths
I'm sure that guy has something to do with her disappearance... or maybe he...
Are you saying she was murdered?
And her spirit is in Young-Ju?
Does that make sense to you?
But, Jin-Hee...
Ji-Won you're not helping out saying this crap
Honey!
Sorry!
Your mother said she found a good child psychologist
Let's get Young-Ju some treatment... and she'll be fine
Ji-Won enough of this phone... and Jin-Hee talk, okay?
But Young-Ju could be in trouble
- We've got to find out why
- The doctor will find out
Stay out of our business
I'll pretend
I didn't hear you
Hey!
Hold still I'm trying
Look how tiny she is
Thanks a lot!
If it weren't for you we wouldn't have Young-Ju
If you hadn't provided the eggs...
No problem but...
I thought we weren't going to tell anyone
When I asked you...
I was worried you'd refuse
I think of her as my own
Just raise her to be as beautiful as you, deal?
Let's do it
The voice you heard on the phone was Jin-Hee's
The voice of sad disturbed Jin-Hee!
You're right Your number was hers
She was excited she had two phones with the same last digits
She said she was giving one to somebody she loved
She looked... real happy
If you asked who he was she'd say it's a secret
She'd disappear after school
She wanted to hang out with me so she could brag about him
I don't know who he was but... she liked him a lot
He liked the Moonlight Sonata... so she asked me to teach her
She wasn't good but she practiced very hard
What's wrong with me?
You have no feeling
You're not going to get him like that
Here watch me
You try it
One day he started avoiding her calls
Let's go in
Come on Let's go
You go in
You're going to be tardy
I said you go in
Love you please answer
Does that make love last?
Of course just like that
Tell us more
Take the letters in your name and add them to the guy's name...
See it's 10
Then, send him this message
I'm your destiny at 10 minutes after the hour
But if I send it he'll know my number
I'm not through
You punch in his number not yours
I'll have to try it
By the way who's this guy?
Leonardo DiCaprio
Really?
How did you get his phone number?
Hey, would you shut up I can't sleep
What's the matter with her?
Stupid bitch!
You got dumped So, now you're writing?
He hasn't called for several days
I sit by the phone all day long
Forget what you saw... or I'll kill you
I don't know how to get away from her
But if you don't want to become... like the taxi driver or that girl... don't answer the phone... and don't look at the phone
Sis!
You didn't come alone, did you?
Jin-Hee...
Jin-Hee came with you didn't she?
LOVE
You're going to catch cold
I like this music
You don't like it, do you?
No!
It's good
This phone's last 4 digits are the same as mine
I'll call you on it nobody else can answer it though
And I'm the only one that can call it
I'm sorry
I told you not to carry this handkerchief
How could you bring it when you're coming to see me?
I'm sorry, I forgot
You forgot?
You take care of everything she gives you... and forget your promise to me?
What, she made it so you think it's wonderful?
What?
Does that upset you?
Jin-Hee
We probably shouldn't meet
For a while
Is that up to you?
She came back from my in-laws
You're making it worse
I'm sorry
You can keep the handkerchief
I can wait for a few days
Just don't say I can't see you
I love you
I couldn't live without you
He wavered for a moment but... this will pass
I believe in our love
What went on with Jin-Hee?
If you don't come clean... what's going to happen to Young-Ju?
There's no time
If you don't tell
I'm going to
It'll save Young-Ju
Hi, Ho Jung
Young-Ju's gone
I don't know what to do
What do you mean she's gone?
I gave her some medicine and put her to bed
I fell asleep too and when I woke up she was gone
Who is this?
Who is this?
That's enough
What exactly do you want?
Chang-Hoon's the one who did you wrong
Leave Young-Ju alone
What do you hope to gain from this?
He wavered for a moment but this will pass
I believe in our love
Where is Young-Ju?
- Be careful!
- Young-Ju!
I'm coming
- Just stay there
- Young-Ju!
Young-Ju Young-Ju
I'm sick of that
That makes me real sick!
Which one of you would like to die for me?
Well, speak up
Young-Ju!
No!
Young-Ju!
Dangerous!
Jin-Hee!
It's Daddy!
Where?
That's Daddy, isn't it?
Isn't that Daddy?
That's not him He's at the office now
I'm at the park now I'll be here until you come
No night school tonight
I want to see you
Why are you avoiding me?
I'm going to tell everything
Don't you want to see me?
I really want to see you
I am going to your office tomorrow
I'm four weeks along
I'm pregnant
What's up?
I was in the area
You're busy I'm probably just bothering you
So, you're going to remodel the Bang Bae house by yourself?
Are you gonna be okay?
We're not moving for a while there's no hurry
Yeah?
I need to go to Japan on business tomorrow
I'll be gone about 4 days
I know you haven't been back long I'm so sorry
Are you?
That's okay
Let's meet at the park now
The phone is turned off so leave your message at the voice mail
You will be charged after the beep
At your age you could fall for a kind, older man... but he's not as simple as you
Men and girls are different
Don't mistake me for a child
You'll find somebody better than him
I don't need anybody else
He'll come back to his family
You hope
Let's get real
Abort the baby
How can you be responsible for a baby in High School?
Nobody will take care of that baby
I'm not asking you to
I'm having the baby
It's my baby made with the one I love
You wouldn't understand because you borrowed an egg
You share nothing with him
You're in fantasyland
If he really loved you why won't he take your calls?
Don't you get it?
No
He loves me
Do you want me to tell you how much we've loved?
We made love here everyday while you were gone
He said he's the happiest person to be with me
You only look good on the outside
Do you how much you smother him?
You think you can create love
Do you know how sick he is of you?
I'm not like you
His love... his baby...
I can take everything
That's enough
Please leave him
Then I'll give you anything you want
Anything I want?
Divorce him
Do you think he loves you?
Get real!
You're the one in fantasyland
The woman he loves is me
You want me to prove he loves me?
You're dead
Ji-Won!
You remember... when I found out I couldn't get pregnant and...
I just wanted to die?
When I'd see children on the street...
I wanted to grab one and run away
If I even saw a pregnant woman...
I would cry... until my eyes felt like falling out
When I'd open my eyes in the morning
The world would be like shattered glass
It was you that gave me strength
But do you know... how jealous I get when you look into Young-Ju's eyes?
Like... she's going to see you as her mother
She's mine
I carried her for 9 months I suffered having her, she's mine
I would do anything for her to be happy, anything
I...
I will do everything if she is happy
No, I can do everything
I can...
You're so wrong
Jin-Hee didn't deserve to die
You killed her for revenge
Let's say you cover everything up
What about Young-Ju?
You think Young-Ju will be happy?
Like before?
Shut up!
She's mine and I'll raise her so she'll never know
If you just keep your mouth shut
That's enough
Look at her
Don't you understand?
Not only Young-Ju
But you're in danger, too
Let's see he kills you... when he finds out Jin-Hee is dead
Then he feels bad about it and kills himself!

Yu-mi Kim Woo-jae Choi
Ji-yeon Choi
- Seo-woo Eun Jong-Soo Yi
- Jeong-yun Choi
- Yes.
- Where are you?
- Are you OK?
- Why, what happened?
Your articles on underage sex scandals caused hell here.
We've had calls threatening you if you don't stop writing them.
I've had them too.
We were ready for that.
Still, be careful.
For the next feature story, let's try that paranormal stuff you talked about last year.
I told you this was the last article.
I'm changing my mobile number and disappearing tomorrow.
Ji-won!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The scared look, so sexy.
Who is this?
You can't be that scared.
We've only just begun.
Who are you?
There's no rush.
We'll meet soon enough.
Hello.
Where are you off to so fast?
It won't help to run.
You bastard!
Why don't you say it to my face?
Don't give me that "deep voice", rat.
Why aren't you following me, rat?
Is this Ji-won's phone?
Oh, Ho-jung.
So?
Do you know who it is?
Some guys abused schoolgirls.
They were humiliated by my sex scandal articles.
It's probably one of them.
The justice system will take care of them.
I'll just go away and finish writing that novel.
What if he really comes after you?
Have you decided where to go?
No, I'm still thinking.
But I can't think of anywhere.
Then, go to Bangbae.
Our new house is empty.
I bought it about a year ago.
It's too big.
We'll move in when Young-ju grows up.
It's well-furnished.
I think you will love it.
What do you think?
Thanks a lot.
Is that OK?
Do you think it's OK to be alone there?
It's dangerous.
It's not dangerous.
I had a security system installed.
But I'm still worried.
Hello, it's clear.
NATIONAL PAINTING CONTEST
This is great.
I'm sorry.
I should stay with you but Young-ju's asleep.
Will you be OK?
Are you scared?
I'm not a little kid.
Don't worry.
I'll be fine.
I'm just worried.
Use my bedroom.
It's the most comfortable.
It's so big.
I'm a little uneasy.
And it's for you and your husband.
I'll take the room upstairs.
The room at the end of the hall?
No, it's full of junk.
I'll clean it up.
You guys go and get some rest.
OK, I'll lock up.
I'll call you tomorrow.
He doesn't quit.
Now what is it?
Now what?
That's weird.
This has never happened before.
- What?
- It only gives one number.
Hello?
You drive well.
I'm sorry.
Please try another branch.
I think it's fate.
Just give me that number.
The girl in the picture is Modigliani's daughter.
He painted it when his wife was pregnant.
He imagined her after observing the neighbours.
Thinking about their unborn daughter, they must have been happy.
I want Young-ju to grow up like that.
In a perfect family.
You have the perfect family.
You ought to paint again.
You're wasting your talent.
I can't take care of the family and paint as well.
I'm satisfied just enjoying the art of others.
Sorry about that.
Is it him again?
No.
I changed my number.
I shouldn't get any more of those calls.
- What's the number?
- 011-9998...
This is Renoir's Irene Cahen d'Anvers.
Young-ju!
Young-ju.
Give us the phone.
Give us the phone!
Good girl.
Young-ju!
Give us the phone.
Give us the phone.
Young-ju!
Young-ju!
Young-ju!
It's OK, Young-ju.
You're worried, aren't you?
Whatever she heard on the phone must have scared her.
I don't think it was the stalker, but it's weird.
Anyway, call me if you go to the doctor tomorrow.
Sure.
Stop it.
It hurts my ears.
Nothing's wrong.
Is she OK?
She's just stressed from whatever scared her.
Give her some time.
She'll be fine.
Since you changed your number you've had two calls.
Your friend Ho-jung and me.
That's impossible.
I've had three strange calls since then.
There are two possibilities.
The phone company's records are messed up or the stalker knows how to block the calls from showing up.
Those sex scandal guys will be on trial in a few days.
It's probably one of them.
But be careful.
Here's a present.
You really think this is going to help?
Zap them once and they're out.
The men involved in the underage sex scandal have been identified.
It's shocking that one of them, Dr Cha, is a psychiatrist.
A Miss Jung has testified that Dr Cha repeatedly demanded perverted sex.
Hello.
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
What's that?
Slow down now.
Tell what?
You're going to catch a cold.
Studying is hard, isn't it?
That's rose.
I love that faint flower fragrance.
Now, which way?
I love you more than anything.
If you hurt, then I hurt too.
So don't be hurting any more, OK?
You're such a strong woman.
I thought you'd give up when the doctor said you couldn't get pregnant.
But with artificial insemination, you did it.
I was really worried.
You get through everything.
Do you know how nervous I get watching you go from crisis to crisis?
I couldn't have done it without you.
- Young-ju!
- Daddy, I'm scared.
Ji-won!
What do you think she heard?
I was so scared.
It started after she answered my phone in the gallery, didn't it?
I checked the phone records, but there's nothing there.
Ji-won.
How about changing your number again?
Then he can't call.
Hello?
Hey, Chang-hoon!
How are you?
Yeah, just a minute.
It's Chang-hoon.
Hi, honey.
You're getting big.
Young-ju.
Do you remember what you heard on my phone?
No.
Aunt!
Do you know what love is?
Love?
Do you know love?
No, you wouldn't know what real love is.
You're in love with somebody.
Who is it?
Daddy.
So, you said you love your daddy.
What about your mummy?
Do you love her?
You're tired.
Go to sleep.
- Aunt!
- Yes?
If that woman calls again, tell her not to yell.
It scares me.
You don't look good.
Is it the phone calls?
Did you find anything?
There is no record of a call at that time.
Even the department at the phone company tracking the calls has no idea.
Are we at a dead end?
I've found this.
People who have had that number.
Nothing strange in their background.
But both people who had that number died.
One in a car crash, the other a heart attack.
It's not necessarily murder, but it is strange.
Finish eating and let's make Daddy a card.
I've got everything ready.
A Christmas card?
Yes.
Who is it?
Flower delivery.
What is it?
Daddy sent them.
Eat!
I said eat!
Eat!
Young-ju, what's the matter?
Nothing.
Young-ju?
What's wrong with you?
He worked hard driving his taxi.
He talked about his dream of opening a restaurant.
Then his wife bought that mobile phone.
Maybe the phone killed him.
The mobile phone?
After he got the phone, he started getting weird calls.
Nobody talked.
Just a bone-chilling sound!
It was like his soul was gone.
He said he wouldn't do night duty.
I asked him why, and he said something about a ghost.
What caused the crash?
Here it is.
Bangbae?
Ho-jung!
What's going on?
She has a strong desire to be with her father.
The long hair represents her as an adult thinking sexually of her father.
She gets jealous, when you and your husband get intimate.
She doesn't want to leave her dad.
Is she trying to push me away?
At her age, it's just a temporary thing.
You mean there's nothing else wrong with her?
No.
She's healthy and intelligent.
You have a very intelligent little girl.
Let's do it again.
Wouldn't it be great if I were on TV, if I were on TV?
Anyway, she lived alone.
For some reason she came home after midnight every night.
Before she died, you should have seen her face.
You know, it was ghostly white.
Was it suicide?
Who commits suicide in a lift?
They said it was a heart attack caused by a fit.
She asked me to call when the trial date was set.
Is she asleep?
What's this?
Hey?
Are you OK?
"One winter day, a queen was sewing by the window.
"Then the queen pricked her finger with her needle.
"Three drops of blood fell into the snow.
"The red on the white looked so beautiful.
"'Lf only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood
"and as black as this frame.'
"...
And the prince and Snow White lived happily ever after."
Yeah, right!
Shit!
We grow up with this crap.
That's why we have little stupid princesses around.
What a stupid story!
Detective?
Get back, he needs surgery.
You made a gross mistake.
You started all this.
You're crazy.
How does it feel to be hanging there?
Beg for your life.
What's the matter?
Why's the fridge open?
You're going to get sick.
Stop worrying.
The doctor said she's fine.
Let's wait a while.
- If she gets worse we can admit her.
- I don't want her admitted.
I'm sorry.
My little princess is awake.
Give me a kiss.
Young-ju!
Young-ju?
Young-ju!
What are you doing?
- Young-ju?
- Young-ju.
What's wrong?
Hi!
You're good on the piano.
You play Moonlight Sonata.
Moonlight Sonata?
You play it every night.
My mum doesn't let me play at night.
My mum says the music comes from your house.
Anybody home?
She had two mobile numbers?
I didn't know it until she was gone.
There was only one phone.
Her number was 9726-6644.
When we couldn't find her, I cancelled the 9998-6644 number.
I kept her number to keep hope alive.
There were a lot of rumours when Jin-hee disappeared.
She ran away with a boyfriend.
She became the most famous prostitute in downtown.
Then they said she got killed and came back to haunt the school.
Why do you say that?
We heard piano music in an empty concert hall at night.
A teacher went in but nobody was there.
We could hear the piano off and on.
The Moonlight Sonata?
How did you know that?
She was practising that song before she disappeared.
Some weird stuff happened to Sang-mi afterwards.
She passed out on the bathroom floor with a mobile phone next to her.
Everybody said it was Jin-hee calling from the dead.
Now everybody's scared of mobile phones.
All phones on your desks.
That does it.
Sang-mi.
Get up here.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Jin-hee was the first to have my phone number.
And she gave it to somebody.
I'm sure it was a man.
What proof do you have?
I couldn't understand everything over the phone.
But she was mad at some guy.
When she disappeared, her mum cancelled the number.
The next two people who got that number died strange deaths.
I'm sure that guy has something to do with her disappearance or maybe he...
Are you saying she was murdered?
And her spirit is in Young-ju?
Does that make sense to you?
But Jin-hee...
Ji-won, you're not helping out by saying this crap.
Honey!
Sorry.
Your mother said she found a good child psychologist.
Let's get Young-ju some treatment and she'll be fine.
Ji-won, enough of this phone and Jin-hee, OK?
But Young-ju could be in trouble.
We should find out why.
The doctor will find out.
Stay out of our business.
I'll pretend I didn't hear you tonight.
Hold still.
I'm trying.
Look how tiny she is.
Thank you.
If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have Young-ju.
If you hadn't provided the eggs.
Forget about it.
We weren't going to tell anyone.
When I asked you,
I was worried you'd refuse.
I think of her as my own.
Just raise her to be as beautiful as you, deal?
Let's do it.
The voice you heard on the phone was Jin-hee's.
The voice of sad and vengeful Jin-hee!
You're right.
Your number was hers.
She was excited she had two phones with the same last digits.
She was going to give one to somebody she loved.
She looked really happy.
If you asked who he was, she'd say it was a secret.
She'd disappear after school.
She wanted to hang out with me so she could brag about him.
I don't know who he was, but she liked him a lot.
He liked the Moonlight Sonata, so she asked me to teach her.
She wasn't good, but she practised very hard.
What's wrong with me?
You have no feeling.
He won't fall in love with that.
Here, watch me.
Try it.
One day he started avoiding her calls.
Let's go in.
- Come on, let's go.
- You go in.
You're going to be late.
I said, you go in.
LOVE YOU.
PLEASE ANSWER...
Does that make love last?
Of course, just like that.
Tell us more.
Take the letters in your name, and add them to the guy's name.
See, it's 10.
Then, send him this message.
"I'm your destiny."
At 10 minutes past the hour.
But if I send it, he'll know my number.
I'm not through.
You punch in his number, not yours.
I'll have to try it.
By the way, who's this guy?
Leonardo DiCaprio.
Really?
How did you get his phone number?
Hey, would you shut up?
I can't sleep.
What's the matter with her?
You got dumped.
So, now you're writing?
Forget what you saw.
Or I'll kill you.
I don't know how to get away from her.
But if you don't want to end up dead there's only one solution.
Don't answer the phone.
Don't look at the phone.
You didn't come alone?
Jin-hee.
Jin-hee came with you?
LOVE
You're going to catch a cold.
I like this.
I suppose it's not your style.
Actually it's good.
The last digits are the same.
Nobody else can answer it.
I'm the only one that can call it.
I'm sorry.
Don't carry this handkerchief.
How could you bring it?
I'm sorry, I forgot.
You forgot?
You take care of everything she gives you.
Did you forget your promise to me?
What's so great about this?
What?
Does that upset you?
Jin-hee.
We probably shouldn't meet.
For a while.
Is that up to you?
She came back from my in-laws.
You're making it worse.
I'm sorry.
You can keep the handkerchief.
I can wait for a few days.
Just don't say I can't see you.
I love you.
I couldn't live without you.
The phone is off.
Do you want to leave a message?
The call will be charged.
He wavered for a moment.
But this will pass.
I believe in our love.
A HAPPY FAMILY LEADS TO SUCCESS
CEO OF DAEHAN BONDS CHANG-HOON LEE
What happened to Jin-hee?
If you don't come clean, what will happen to Young-ju?
There's no time.
If you don't tell, I'm going to.
It will save Young-ju.
- Hi, Ho-jung.
- Young-ju's gone.
What should I do?
What do you mean, she's gone?
I gave her some medicine and put her to bed.
I fell asleep too.
When I woke up, she was gone.
Who is this?
Who is this?
That's enough.
What exactly do you want?
Chang-hoon's the one who did you wrong.
Leave Young-ju alone.
What do you gain from this?
He wavered for a moment.
But this will pass.
I believe in our love.
Where is Young-ju?
Young-ju!
Be careful!
I'm coming, just stay there.
"Young-ju, Young-ju."
I'm sick of that.
Which one of you would like to die for me?
Well, speak up.
Jin-hee!
It's Daddy.
Where?
That's Daddy, isn't it?
Isn't that Daddy?
That's not him.
He's at the office now.
I'M WAITING AT THE PARK NOW.
- First message.
- No night school tonight.
Let's meet.
Why are you avoiding me?
I'm going to tell everything.
Don't you want to see me?
I really want to see you.
I am coming to your office tomorrow.
I'm four weeks along.
I'm pregnant.
What's up?
I was in the area.
You're busy.
I'm bothering you.
So, you're going to remodel the Bangbae house by yourself?
It's hard work.
We're not moving yet.
There's no hurry.
OK!
I need to go to Japan on business tomorrow.
It'll take three days.
I know you haven't been back long.
I'm so sorry.
Are you?
That's OK.
The phone is off.
Please leave a message...
At your age, you could fall for a kind, older man.
But he's not as simple as you.
Men and girls are different.
Don't mistake me for a child.
You'll find somebody better than him.
I don't need anybody else.
He'll come back to his family.
You hope.
Let's get real.
Abort the baby.
How can you be responsible for a baby when you're in school?
Nobody will take care of that baby.
I'm not asking you to.
I'm having the baby.
My lover and I made this baby.
You wouldn't understand, because you borrowed an egg.
You share nothing with him.
You're in a fantasy land.
If he really loved you, why won't he take your calls?
Don't you get it?
No, he loves me.
Do you want me to tell you how much we've loved?
We made love here every day while you were gone.
He said he'd never been happier.
You only look good on the outside.
Do you know how much you smother him?
You think you can create love.
He's really sick of you.
I'm not like you.
His love, his baby.
I can take everything.
That's enough!
Please leave him.
Then I'll give you anything you want.
Anything I want?
Divorce him.
Do you think he loves you?
Get real!
You're the one in a fantasy land.
He loves me!
You want proof?
You're dead!
Ji-won, do you remember?
When I found out I was sterile I just wanted to die.
When I saw children on the street I wanted to run away with one.
When I saw a pregnant woman I would cry.
When I'd open my eyes in the morning the world would be like shattered glass.
It was you that gave me strength.
But do you know how jealous I get when you look into Young-ju's eyes?
Maybe she would see you as her mother.
She's mine.
I carried her for 10 months.
I suffered having her.
She's mine.
I would do anything for her to be happy.
Yes, I can do everything.
I can.
You don't understand.
Jin-hee didn't deserve to die.
She became a vengeful ghost.
Let's say you cover everything up.
What about Young-ju?
You think Young-ju will be happy?
Like before?
Shut up!
She's mine and I'll raise her.
She'll never know if you just keep your mouth shut.
Stop it.
Look at her.
Don't you understand?
It's not just Young-ju.
You're in danger too.
When he found out Jin-hee was dead, he killed you.
Then he felt bad about it and killed himself.
I'm your destiny
Stop it!
Please stop it!
- Yeah!
- Where are you?
- Are you okay?
- Why, what happened?
Things have blown up about your underage sex scandal articles
We've got calls threatening you if you don't stop writing them
I've gotten them too We were ready for that
Still, be careful
For the next feature story let's try some of that paranormal stuff you were talking about last year
I told you this was the last article
I'm changing my cell number and disappearing tomorrow
Ji-Won!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The scared look, so sexy
Who is this?
You can't be that scared
We've only just begun
Who are you?
There's no rush We'll meet soon enough
Hello
Where are you off to so fast?
It won't help to run
You bastard!
If you've got something to say come and face me
Don't cover your voice and hide like a rat
Why aren't you following, rat?
Is this Ji-Won's phone?
Oh, Ho Jung
So?
Do you know who it is?
It's probably one of the guys... from the sex scandal articles
The justice system will take care of them
I'll just go away and finish writing that novel
What if he really comes after you?
Have you decided where to go?
No, I'm still thinking
You ought to go to Bang Bae
Our new house is empty
I bought it about a year ago.
It's too big
We'll move in there when Young-Ju gets a little bigger
It's well-furnished I think you will love it
What do you think?
Thanks a lot
Ho Jung, is that okay?
Honey, do you think it's okay to be alone there?
It's dangerous
It's not dangerous
I've had a security system installed
But I'm still worried
This is great
I'm sorry
I should stay with you but Young-Ju's asleep
Will you be okay?
Aren't you scared?
I'm not a little kid
Don't worry I'll be fine
I'm just worried
Which room should I use?
Use my bedroom It's the most comfortable
It's so big I'm a little uneasy
And it's for you and your husband
I'll take the room at the end of the hall upstairs
That room?
No, it's full of junk
It's a storage room
I'll clean it up
You guys go and get some rest Ok, I'll lock up
I'll call you tomorrow
He doesn't quit
Now what is it?
Now what?
What's this?
That's weird
That's never happened before
What?
It only gives one number
Hello?
You drive well
I'm sorry
You'll need to go to another branch
I think it's fate
Just give me that number
The girl in the picture is Modigliani's daughter
He painted it when his wife was pregnant
He painted it after watching
Thinking about their unborn daughter they must have been happy
I want...
Young-Ju to grow up like that... in a perfect family
You ought to paint again
You have the perfect family
You're wasting your talent
I don't think I could take care of the family and paint right now
I'm satisfied just enjoying other's art
Sorry about that
Is it him again?
No
Since I changed my cell number I shouldn't get any more those calls
What's the number?
This is Renoir's Irene Cahen d'Anvers
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju
Give us the phone
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
Give us the phone.
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
Give me the phone!
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju!
You're worried, aren't you?
Whatever she heard on the phone must have scared her
I don't think it was the stalker but it's weird
Anyway call me if you go to the doctor tomorrow
Sure I will...
Stop it
It hurts my ears
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong
Is she okay?
She's just stressed from whatever scared her
Give her some time
She'll be fine
Since you changed your number you've had 2 calls
Your friend Ho Jung and me
That's not right
I've had three strange calls since then
There are two possibilities
The phone company's records are messed up... or the stalker knows... how to block the calls from showing up
Those sex scandal guys will be on trial in a few days
It's probably one of them
But be careful
Here's a present
You really think this is going to help?
Hit them once and they're out
The men involved in the underage sex scandal have been identified
It's shocking that one of them
Dr. Cha, is a psychiatrist
A Miss Jung has testified that Dr. Cha... repeatedly demanded perverted sex
Hello
So, who the hell are you?
Hello?
What do you mean?
Slow down now
What are you going to tell?
You're going to catch cold
Studying is hard, isn't it?
A faint rose smell
I love that faint flower fragrance
Now, which way?
I love you more than anything
If you're hurting then I hurt too
So don't be hurting anymore, okay?
hurting anymore, okay?
You're such a strong woman
I thought you'd give up... when the doctor said you couldn't get pregnant
But with that artificial program you did it
When I think of that time
I still feel faint
Do you know how nervous I get... watching you go from crisis to crisis?
What would I do without you?
I couldn't have done it without you
- Young-Ju!
- Daddy, I'm scared
Ji-Won!
What do you think she heard?
I was so scared
It started after... she answered my phone in the museum, didn't it?
I checked the phone records but there's nothing there
Ji-Won
How about changing your number again?
Then he can't call
Hello?
Hey, Chang-Hoon!
What's up?
Yeah, just a minute
It's Chang-Hoon
Hi, honey
You're getting big
Young-Ju
Do you remember what you heard on my phone?
No
Aunt!
Do you know what love is?
Love?
Do you know love?
No, you wouldn't know... what real love is
You're in love with somebody
Who is it?
Daddy
So, you said you love your Daddy
What about your Mommy?
Do you love her?
Don't you love your mommy?
You're tired
Go to sleep
Aunt!
If... that woman calls again tell her not to yell
It scares me
You don't look good
Is it the phone calls?
Did you find anything?
There is no record of a call coming in on your cell at that time
Even the department at a phone company tracking the calls has no idea
Are we at a dead end?
This is what I've found
People who've had that number
Nothing strange in their background
But you know... both people that had that number died
One in a car wreck the other a heart attack
It's not necessarily murder... but it is strange
Finish eating and let's make Daddy a card
I've got everything ready
A Christmas card?
Yeah
- Who is it?
- Flower Delivery
What is it?
Daddy sent them
Sorry for not helping out lately I love you!
Eat it
I said eat it!
Eat it
Young-Ju what's the matter?
Nothing
Young-Ju?
What's wrong with you?
He worked hard driving his taxi and... he talked about his dream of opening a restaurant
Then his wife bought that cell phone
I don't know if it was the phone that killed him
The cell phone?
He said that after he got the cell phone he started getting weird calls
Nobody talking!
Just a bone chilling sound!
It was like his soul was gone
One day, he said he wouldn't do night duty
I asked him why and he said something about a ghost
What caused the wreck?
Here it is
Bang Bae?
Ho Jung!
What's going on?
She has an unusually strong desire to be with her father
The long hair represents her... as an adult thinking sexually of her father
She gets jealous when you and your husband get intimate... and she doesn't want to leave her Dad
Is she trying to push me away?
At her age it's just a temporary thing
You mean there is anything else wrong with her?
No
Developmentally and health-wise she's fine
You have a very intelligent little girl
Let's do it again
Se-se-se...
Wouldn't it be great if I were on TV if I were on TV?
Anyway she lived alone
For some reason she came home after midnight every night
Before she died you should have seen her face
You know it was ghostly white
Was it suicide?
Who commits suicide in an elevator?
They said it was a heart attack caused by some mental fit
She asked me to call when they got a trial date
Is she already asleep?
What's this?
Hey?
Are you okay?
One winter day, a certain queen was sewing by the window
Then the queen pricked her finger with her needle
Three drops of blood fell into the snow
The red on the white looked so beautiful, that she thought...
"If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood..."
and as black as this frame ...and they lived happily ever after
Yeah, right!
Shit!
We grow up with this crap that's why... we have little stupid princesses around
What a stupid story!
Detective?
Get away he needs surgery
I told you not to mess with me
You started all this
You're crazy
How does it feel to be hanging by a thread?
Beg me to save you
What's the matter?
Why's the fridge open?
You're going to make yourself sick
Stop worrying The doctor said she'd be fine
Let's wait a while
If she gets worse we can admit her
I don't want her admitted
I'm sorry
My little princess is awake
Give me a kiss
Young-Ju!
Young-Ju?
Young-Ju What's wrong with you?
Young-Ju?
Young-Ju What's are you doing?
Hi!
You're good on the piano You are already on the Moonlight Sonata?
The Moonlight sonata?
That song you play every night
My Mom doesn't let me play at night
That's strange!
My Mom says the music comes from your house
Anybody home?
She had two cell numbers?
But there was only 1 phone
I didn't know it until she was gone
Her number was 9726-6644
When we couldn't find her
I cancelled the 9998-6644 number
I kept her number to keep hope alive
There were a lot of rumors when Jin-Hee disappeared
She ran away with a boyfriend
She worked at a bar "She was a stripteaser."
But one day... they said she got killed... and came back to haunt the school
Where did that come from?
We heard piano music in an empty concert hall at night
A teacher went in but nobody was there
We could hear the piano off and on
The Moonlight Sonata?
How'd you know that?
She was practicing that song before she disappeared
Sang Mi had some weird stuff happen, too
She passed out on the bathroom floor with a cell phone next to her
Everybody said it was Jin-Hee calling from the dead
Now everybody's scared of cell phones
Okay all phones on your desks
Be quiet
Sang Mi that does it
Sang Mi Get up here
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Jin-Hee was the first to have my phone number
And she gave it to somebody
I'm sure it's a guy
What proof do you have?
I heard stuff on my phone I didn't understand it all but... she was mad at some guy
When she disappeared... her Mom cancelled the number
The next two people who got that number died strange deaths
I'm sure that guy has something to do with her disappearance... or maybe he...
Are you saying she was murdered?
And her spirit is in Young-Ju?
Does that make sense to you?
But, Jin-Hee...
Ji-Won you're not helping out saying this crap
Honey!
Sorry!
Your mother said she found a good child psychologist
Let's get Young-Ju some treatment... and she'll be fine
Ji-Won enough of this phone... and Jin-Hee talk, okay?
But Young-Ju could be in trouble
- We've got to find out why
- The doctor will find out
Stay out of our business
I'll pretend
I didn't hear you
Hey!
Hold still I'm trying
Look how tiny she is
Thanks a lot!
If it weren't for you we wouldn't have Young-Ju
If you hadn't provided the eggs...
No problem but...
I thought we weren't going to tell anyone
When I asked you...
I was worried you'd refuse
I think of her as my own
Just raise her to be as beautiful as you, deal?
Let's do it
The voice you heard on the phone was Jin-Hee's
The voice of sad disturbed Jin-Hee!
You're right Your number was hers
She was excited she had two phones with the same last digits
She said she was giving one to somebody she loved
She looked... real happy
If you asked who he was she'd say it's a secret
She'd disappear after school
She wanted to hang out with me so she could brag about him
I don't know who he was but... she liked him a lot
He liked the Moonlight Sonata... so she asked me to teach her
She wasn't good but she practiced very hard
What's wrong with me?
You have no feeling
You're not going to get him like that
Here watch me

One day he started avoiding her calls
Let's go in

You go in
You're going to be tardy
I said you go in
Love you please answer
Does that make love last?
Of course just like that
Tell us more
Take the letters in your name and add them to the guy's name...
See it's 10
Then, send him this message
I'm your destiny at 10 minutes after the hour
But if I send it he'll know my number
I'm not through
You punch in his number not yours
I'll have to try it
By the way who's this guy?
Leonardo DiCaprio
Really?
How did you get his phone number?
Hey, would you shut up I can't sleep
What's the matter with her?
Stupid bitch!
You got dumped So, now you're writing?
He hasn't called for several days
I sit by the phone all day long
Forget what you saw... or I'll kill you
I don't know how to get away from her
But if you don't want to become... like the taxi driver or that girl... don't answer the phone... and don't look at the phone
Sis!
You didn't come alone, did you?
Jin-Hee...
Jin-Hee came with you didn't she?
LOVE
You're going to catch cold
I like this music
You don't like it, do you?
No!
It's good
This phone's last 4 digits are the same as mine
I'll call you on it nobody else can answer it though
And I'm the only one that can call it
I'm sorry
I told you not to carry this handkerchief
How could you bring it when you're coming to see me?
I'm sorry, I forgot
You forgot?
You take care of everything she gives you... and forget your promise to me?
What, she made it so you think it's wonderful?
What?
Does that upset you?
Jin-Hee
We probably shouldn't meet
For a while
Is that up to you?
She came back from my in-laws
You're making it worse
I'm sorry
You can keep the handkerchief
I can wait for a few days
Just don't say I can't see you
I love you
I couldn't live without you
He wavered for a moment but... this will pass
I believe in our love
What went on with Jin-Hee?
If you don't come clean... what's going to happen to Young-Ju?
There's no time
If you don't tell
I'm going to
It'll save Young-Ju
Hi, Ho Jung
Young-Ju's gone
I don't know what to do
What do you mean she's gone?
I gave her some medicine and put her to bed
I fell asleep too and when I woke up she was gone
Who is this?
Who is this?
That's enough
What exactly do you want?
Chang-Hoon's the one who did you wrong
Leave Young-Ju alone
What do you hope to gain from this?
He wavered for a moment but this will pass
I believe in our love
Where is Young-Ju?
- Be careful!
- Young-Ju!
I'm coming
- Just stay there
- Young-Ju!
Young-Ju Young-Ju
I'm sick of that
That makes me real sick!
Which one of you would like to die for me?
Well, speak up
Young-Ju!
No!
Young-Ju!
Dangerous!
Jin-Hee!
It's Daddy!
Where?
That's Daddy, isn't it?
Isn't that Daddy?
That's not him He's at the office now
I'm at the park now I'll be here until you come
No night school tonight
I want to see you
Why are you avoiding me?
I'm going to tell everything
I really want to see you
I am going to your office tomorrow
I'm four weeks along
I'm pregnant
What's up?
I was in the area
You're busy I'm probably just bothering you
So, you're going to remodel the Bang Bae house by yourself?
Are you gonna be okay?
We're not moving for a while there's no hurry
Yeah?
I'll be gone about 4 days
I know you haven't been back long I'm so sorry
Are you?
That's okay
Don't you want to see me?
Let's meet at the park now
The phone is turned off so leave your message at the voice mail
You will be charged after the beep
At your age you could fall for a kind, older man... but he's not as simple as you
Men and girls are different
Don't mistake me for a child
You'll find somebody better than him
I don't need anybody else
He'll come back to his family
You hope
Let's get real
Abort the baby
How can you be responsible for a baby in High School?
Nobody will take care of that baby
I'm not asking you to
I'm having the baby
It's my baby made with the one I love
You wouldn't understand
because you borrowed an egg
You share nothing with him
You're in fantasyland
If he really loved you why won't he take your calls?
Don't you get it?
No
He loves me
Do you want me to tell you how much we've loved?
We made love here everyday while you were gone
He said he's the happiest person to be with me
You only look good on the outside
Do you how much you smother him?
You think you can create love
Do you know how sick he is of you?
I'm not like you
His love... his baby...
I can take everything
That's enough
Please leave him
Then I'll give you anything you want
Anything I want?
Divorce him
Do you think he loves you?
Get real!
You're the one in fantasyland
The woman he loves is me
You want me to prove he loves me?
You're dead
Ji-Won!
You remember... when I found out I couldn't get pregnant and...
I just wanted to die?
When I'd see children on the street...
I wanted to grab one and run away
If I even saw a pregnant woman...
I would cry... until my eyes felt like falling out
When I'd open my eyes in the morning
The world would be like shattered glass
It was you that gave me strength
But do you know... how jealous I get when you look into Young-Ju's eyes?
Like... she's going to see you as her mother
She's mine
I carried her for 9 months I suffered having her, she's mine
I would do anything for her to be happy, anything
I...
I will do everything if she is happy
No, I can do everything
I can...
You're so wrong
Jin-Hee didn't deserve to die
You killed her for revenge
Let's say you cover everything up
What about Young-Ju?
You think Young-Ju will be happy?
Like before?
Shut up!
She's mine and I'll raise her so she'll never know
If you just keep your mouth shut
That's enough
Look at her
Don't you understand?
Not only Young-Ju
But you're in danger, too
Let's see he kills you... when he finds out Jin-Hee is dead
Then he feels bad about it and kills himself!
I need to go to Japan on business tomorrow
Previously on The West Wing:
Andy's pregnant.
It's twins and, of course, I'm the father.
You know I'm gonna get sued.
- I work for Senator Hoynes.
- Yeah.
I wonder if I'd listened to you two years ago, would I be president right now?
- You did it for the widow?
- And for a guy named Will Bailey who ran the campaign and worked his ass off.
You might be asked tomorrow if you're endorsing me.
- Am I?
Toby, is the president endorsing Sam?
We think you should run.
- What do you think?
- I think you should win.
How do you interpret the margin of victory?
The votes have been counted and the people have spoken and it's clear that their will is for me to do and have anything I want.
Mr. President, Arnold White, Associated Press what's the first legislative priority?
- There's a new guy from AP?
- Yeah, what's your priority?
The president of Turkmenistan just officially extended the date of adolescence to 25.
So things like that.
I think he also renamed the month of January after himself.
That's greedy.
Real power is knowing when to leave something on the table.
- Sir, what legislative...?
- Patients' Bill of Rights, drugs keeping the economy growing, find a surplus again keep the surplus growing, use the surplus to build schools worthy of defending the military that Fitz and Hutchinson are gonna build to fight urban wars, then pay the teachers.
I asked for a legislative priority, you gave me nine.
It's a big country, Arnold.
Debbie, where the hell are you?
And where are my...?
You left your glasses in the mansion and the Ipswich clams in Chesapeake Bay can hear you bellowing right now.
Ipswich clams don't come from Chesapeake Bay.
They come from Ipswich.
- Not anymore.
- Have her beheaded for my birthday.
They'll ask you how you feel about housing starts going down.
I don't care as long as I'm keeping this one.
- GDP growth is strong.
- You bet your ass it is which, by the way, I can pad anytime I want now.
The voters have spoken.
Lowest inflation in 20 years.
Housing starts are cyclical, which is the thing.
What do you got?
- Flooding in Missouri.
- FEMA's on the ground?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I've got the Swiss ambassador in my office.
I don't know why.
You and I enjoy your funny jokes, but Idaho, not so much.
- Take it easy in there?
- I know my people.
Sometimes it's hard to believe I'm one of them.
Good luck.
Thank you.
- Ambassador Von Rutte.
- Okay.
- Thank you for seeing me.
- What's going on?
A communication from Tehran.
You understand our mission's the only one.
The president appreciates it.
The ayatollah's son has a congenital heart condition Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
His best chance is a simultaneous heart and lung transplant.
- They asked Japan?
- Procedures differ, they want yours.
- What's wrong with Japan's?
- Well, I don't know how to...
No one...
- It hasn't been successful?
- No.
Okay, then ours is better.
Anybody else do this?
- Just the U.S. and Japan.
- No, Japan doesn't do it yet.
Coming close doesn't matter on this, it's not the Gemini missions.
I'm gonna talk to the president, but if it means bumping an American off...
Iran has a donor.
- A donor or a dissenter?
- This is from Doctors Without Borders.
It wasn't from the ayatollah?
They were approached by the ayatollah's brother-in-law.
This is coming through you, through an NGO, through the brother-in-law.
Guy will put his son's life in the infidels' hands, but he'll keep his distance?
The hard-liners control the Majlis.
Things are difficult for him with the Shehab missile tests.
He cannot have a problem with his right flank.
Yeah, much better we should have a problem with ours.
- I'll talk to him.
- The president?
Don 't get me wrong, Mark, I think January's a good month.
Yeah, the president, generalissimo, whatever he comes back as.
- Messages.
- Goodwin at AP.
- What else?
- Judy Vanderbass wife of our ambassador to Vietnam, you've been to her house.
Yeah, I'm sure I ate a springer spaniel.
Why is AP on my phone sheet?
Triplehorn told him you're the reason there's no deal on prescription drugs.
- I'm the reason?
-"With Lyman negotiating..." Yeah.
- I feel ill-will toward the minority leader.
- I've had it up to here with the Welsh.
I'm not kidding.
He was campaigning with us a half-hour ago.
School's back.
Go see him.
Let's call that Plan A. Plan B is you see him.
- Karen Kroft.
- And National Parks screw me up again.
Yeah.
I'm gonna head to the leader's office.
Get me the first free minute he has.
And Judy Vanderbass?
Let's do this.
Find out what her problem is solve it, and then do something else.
- You're the reason there are term limits.
- Yeah?
You're the reason...
Nothing.
Nothing's happening.
Nothing's there.
- You seem fine.
- I am.
- You really seem fine.
- I really am.
Good.
The view from the canvas, it's educational, you know.
Yeah, I've had extensive education.
What was the final margin?
One hundred and twenty-seven votes.
- A hundred and twenty-seven.
- That's about 12 lawn signs.
- Wasn't your last election also...?
- Eighty-two votes.
The president says all you need is one, the rest is for ego.
- How many did the president win by?
- About three and a half million.
- Yeah.
- He's got a pretty healthy ego, though.
I don't know, maybe the job wasn't for me.
I like land.
I like dirt.
I like things that live on land and dirt.
I like hotels.
I like a good concierge.
Could you be a little more sympathetic?
I'm a loser.
Not a big one.
Okay.
The president thinks there's a place for you.
That's nice of you guys.
It really is.
But I was thinking about...
I was thinking about maybe trying for a job with the National Park Service.
- We were thinking the same thing.
- A job with the National Park Service?
As what?
The director of the National Park Service.
- Are you kidding me?
- No.
- You're not kidding?
- No.
- Is this just because...?
- Do you want it?
Yes.
Yes.
Then get yourself a big hat, and Leo's gonna call you in a couple hours.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy are the first three for tea.
- All's well that ends well.
- Karen Kroft.
National Parks chairman.
- Nice.
- She's very happy.
Andy's about to get sued for election fraud.
- Andy was trying to get sued for fraud.
- Really?
Yeah.
She's a pistol.
Everyone, please take your seats.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy are the first three for tea with the president at 3 p.m. in the Map Room.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy.
Next week it's Mark, Leslie and Eric.
- Who's running Sam's campaign?
- Sam's putting his team together.
I'm referring those questions to the campaign's press office.
John, Katie.
Will the president attend...?
Mr. Seaborn, how does it feel to have the nomination?
There is no nomination, there is a primary and if someone gets 50 percent of the vote, there is no general.
There are no other Democrats running.
They're endorsing you.
- Wouldn't you say you're the nominee?
- I suppose.
- Have you staffed the key positions yet?
- I'm gonna let Will Bailey answer.
Campaign manager is Scott Holcomb.
Finance director is Betsy Wadkins.
Communications director is Mark Stearns.
Excuse me for a second.
Can I talk to you?
Political director is Tom Baker.
The volunteer coordinator is Paula Montgomery.
- Over here, please.
- Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Scott's campaign manager?
What's your title?
- Citizen Bailey.
- I'm not kidding.
- I'm the chancellor of Germany.
- Will...
- What the hell's going on?
- Your team's in the field.
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, Will.
You and I had this conversation for two hours.
What are you doing?
- I don't think you should go.
- You made that clear.
- I'm doing this now.
- Listen, there are too many chiefs here.
- I'll get rid of some.
- No, you want them.
Scott Holcomb and Betsy, these guys are the best.
We just went from 435 House races to one.
You get the all-star team.
He doesn't want the best, he wants you.
Yes, but the Republicans are starting their starters, so you gotta match up.
We match up fine.
You got me into this.
Well, you got you into this but I owe you the best chance to win.
I owe that to Mr. Wilde.
Tell him that's ridiculous.
I took the race to show the DNC that no district should be ignored.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll stick around for a week and help and then I'm gonna take a vacation.
- Where?
- I don't know.
France, Italy, Wales.
Maybe EPCOT.
All right.
I've gotta head to Washington.
I'll see you day after tomorrow.
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you.
- Have a good flight, Sam.
- Thank you.
- EPCOT?
- I was kidding.
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.
- Sir?
- Yeah.
It's called penmanship, Watson.
Something your generation wouldn't know about because of the computers.
- How many of these things am I doing?
- Sixty.
- How many have I done?
- Three.
- Three?
- Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.
- Your system's slowing me down.
- I don't have a system.
- You're kidding?
- You ready?
Hey, can't we have color codings and stickers, priority lists?
- Can I get a little bureaucracy going?
- What are you doing?
I'm doing basically what the president does.
Ask people for things and then thank them for things.
Let's go.
Take the calls to the mansion.
I'll meet you there after this.
We had a couple of cats when the kids were kids named Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilburforce or something, I can't remember.
You know, I've never really liked human names for animals.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, I can't believe my kids didn't think to ask you what to name the cats.
But they used to bring mice into the house and show them to me.
This is how I'm starting to feel about the Swiss.
Yeah.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
Tell me about the boy.
He and a guardian have crossed into Kandahar.
A UN plane is on the ground.
It's gonna leave at 11:45 Zulu if you say okay.
- Eleven forty-five?
- Yes, sir.
- That's 11 minutes from now.
- Yes, sir.
This meeting's premature.
- We should wait 10 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
This meeting doesn't go in the Sit Room anymore, okay?
I don't know why it's here.
This isn't a military operation.
- It's a secure room.
- My office is a secure room too, isn't it?
Please, somebody tell me it is, or I gotta go pack some stuff.
- You see my point?
- What about the organs?
- The organs are in Zurich.
- I'm sorry, that sounded funny to me.
I'm the kid in bio who laughed all the time.
- Then on to Paris on Swiss Air.
- Coach?
- I don't...
- Then New York?
- Yes, sir.
- The heart and lungs get here first.
They can last about 40 hours, the flight from Tehran's 15.
What's left is to line up a doctor and get the funding.
- Go around the room.
- If it leaks, you got clerics.
It sends a message to the reformists.
At a time when they're breaking 70 percent in local elections.
If you're looking for ways to temper support to the Shiites, I don't...
- A benevolent power must...
- This isn't the time.
Don't forget the Shehab program and the transport corridors along the Silk Route.
How old is he?
- I'm sorry?
- How old is he?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.
The Shiites, Manny that's what you want me to take back to my thoracic surgeon wife?
Get this boy in preop.
Tell the Swiss to stop standing in the door with a mouse in their mouth.
- If they're coming in, come in.
- You won't regret it, sir.
It won't leak.
No, because we're in a secure room, except for the ayatollah's staff a Swiss Air pilot and 400 other people.
- Laney, is this gonna leak?
- Well...
I feel better already.
Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilburforce.
There's nothing wrong with my memory.
Though those are stupid names.
There's something wrong with my kids.
Come on, Josh.
The Senate's out of session you ought to think about putting a Ping-Pong table out here.
- I don't think that would be a good idea.
- Quick rounds between motions...
- Now just because the Senate's not...
- I'm kidding.
- You'd be surprised what people think.
- Read the AP wire.
- You know what that's about.
- Yeah, you're running for president.
We hold elections in this country, not coronations.
- I'm not saying any different.
- Then why is every...?
I must've...
I've talked to two dozen of your precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
- Nearly every one of them's locked up.
- They're locked...
You're recruiting precinct captains 48 months before the next election?
John Hoynes is using the White House to lock up the Democratic primaries.
If you're saying there's a nomination fight...
Hoynes doesn't inherit this.
I'm not gonna see the party dragged to the middle.
Nothing's being dragged anywhere.
You were with us just days ago.
- This is about the future of the party.
- Yeah, how about we enjoy the present?
You agree with Hoynes on guns?
On trade?
On school choice?
Look, Hoynes is...
Did I fall asleep for three and a half years?
You think a minority leader's irrelevant?
You think I can't affect the president's agenda?
- I know you can.
- I'd like you to be for me, Josh.
Not because you're good at what you do, because of your beliefs.
Okay, I'm not for anyone.
I barely unpacked from the last campaign.
Well, Hoynes is gonna have to release those precinct captains or we're...
It keeps getting earlier, doesn't it?
Yes.
And they're asking for you in the HHS meeting, and the 5: 15's new.
- The CEA?
- Ways to fight a possible recession.
- What did we say?
-"Don't say 'recession' in this building."
- You just did it again!
- What do I call the meeting?
The robust economy meeting.
- Josh is patching it up with Triplehorn.
- Good.
- And Karen Kroft wants National Parks.
- She can't have it.
- What are you talking about?
- She can't.
- We talked about it.
- The president signed the Parks Bill.
- The job just became Senate-confirmable.
- Yeah, that was for next fiscal year.
It turns out it's retroactive.
I just saw the final language.
Thanks.
- Whose idea...?
How did we miss this?
- There are 90 amendments in the bill.
- Maybe we put her up anyway.
- No.
- We asked her to do it.
- She led the charge for a higher gas tax.
- We asked her to do it.
- The Senate isn't gonna understand.
Plus, the minority leader is already pissed at us.
Okay, thanks.
Ginger.
Don't.
I need a list of sub-cabinet vacancies that aren't Senate-confirmable.
- Mine's not.
- A little less sub-cabinet than that one.
You wanna crash a space probe into Neptune, that's fine with me.
I think we've crashed into most of the other planets, but 2.5 billion, okay?
- Yes, sir.
- If we fail, I wanna do it on budget.
Thank you, Mr. President.
More thank-you notes?
Why don't you tell Debbie we're gonna do some calls.
- Calls?
- Yes, calls.
Calls.
Mr. Sarcasm with your dry"calls."
I was this close to renaming one of the oceans after you, but no way.
Maybe, maybe, one of the species of fish.
Like trout.
Trout is now Charlie.
Went to the lake, pulled out a Charlie for dinner.
Look at the size of that Charlie you've got on your wall.
Thank you, sir.
- What do you got?
- Yeah, we've got a situation.
- Yeah?
- Reuters has the ayatollah's son just left Afghanistan on a C-130.
Is he coming here for a heart transplant?
- Heart and lung.
- I'm assuming we knew about this.
- Knew about it?
We did it.
- The ayatollah's issued a statement.
- What kind?
- Bitterly denouncing it, sir.
"Our nation can take care of its own.
Interference from the West is an affront to Islam."
What's the room saying?
They think we're hiding Leo's meeting with the Swiss.
- So you know, the press coffee...
- Can't do it now.
Yes.
You're right.
- I need you to step out just a moment.
- Sure.
Thank you.
- We're not gonna not do it.
- I'm with you.
Hi.
Before you say anything, here's my idea.
The kid needs lungs and a heart.
Let's use the ayatollah's.
- What are you smiling at?
- I'm sorry, it's...
I'm sorry, sir.
It's the little note Margaret just passed me.
"The Iranians, they've taken to the streets." Perfect.
- That goes to the Margaret Museum.
- Please don't forget all politics are local.
- Bite me.
- He's gotta say something to...
He's got to say something to his hard-liners.
He didn't wanna try"My son is dying, and these guys maybe can fix him.
And maybe if our citizens didn't spend so much energy denouncing infidels they'd have time to build a damn medical school!"
The Swiss talked to the NGO, who talked to the brother-in-law who speaks for the ayatollah.
Just tell me that they weren't using cellular technology because I don't care what anybody says, it doesn't work yet.
Think about linking it to the missile tests.
- What do you mean?
- Send a communiqué through the Swiss.
The ayatollah's gotta honor Bahrain.
Stop all tests of the Shehab-3.
He's gonna say no.
That's when you tell him you're gonna turn the plane around.
- No.
- I said, you threaten...
No.
Come on.
That's a 15-year-old non-combatant on his way to a hospital.
Pretend that plane's got a big red cross on it.
- They perfect medium-range missiles.
- I understand.
- What's that do for hearts and lungs?
- Send a communiqué.
There's a Bahrain agreement that says...
Send it.
Don't even come close.
I don't even want a scent of linkage to...
A big damn red cross right on that plane.
Thanks for your help.
I'll let you know.
- I got this problem to put in perspective.
- What's the problem?
Triplehorn thinks I'm a secret operative for Hoynes.
- Are you?
- I don't believe I am.
- This ought to help.
- What?
- Vanderbass didn't invite you to dinner.
- Thank merciful God.
Turns out Trish Rackley, wife of your protégé she had a problem on the CODEL to Southeast Asia.
The rice?
No, really, the whole continent loves the stereotype.
- They eat a lot of rice, Donna.
- Mrs. Rackley borrowed $ 1500 from Judy Vanderbass to buy a teak bed for 2000, which is a good price.
- And?
- Mrs. Rackley's check bounced.
- Making it a great price.
- The Rackleys are stiffing her, Josh.
- What do you mean,"Josh"?
- You put him on the delegation.
I told State to look after him.
I didn't want him in trouble.
Phil Rackley's office won't return her calls.
Well, see if they'll return yours.
- Toby, Triplehorn's on fire.
- He needs to build a case against...
Hoynes is lining up precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
This is 10 minutes after the polls close in California.
And Winnick just called.
It's probably the same thing.
Half the Senate's gonna run.
If it looks like we're giving Hoynes...
Yeah.
You gotta back him off.
Okay, devil's advocate.
- Isn't Hoynes entitled?
- Yeah, but not yet.
It's just we got him on the ticket by convincing him it wasn't his turn.
We kept him out, because it wasn't his turn, and now...
There aren't any turns.
So these two people rob a Starbucks near Seattle.
Half an hour they serve coffee to make more money.
- Know when they make their getaway?
- When business slows down.
Beat that?
- When's Josh meeting with Hoynes?
- Soon.
What do you need?
Alternate federal co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission.
- What about it?
- It's Senate-confirmable.
- Really?
- So is commissioner of Hopi Relocation.
Let me tell you something about this job, you need a deep bench.
Inspector general of the Railroad Retirement Board director of the Institute of Museum Studies...
- My job's not.
- Ginger beat you to that joke.
- Karen lost her seat because of us.
- What do you want me to do?
Get used to the fact that we won in a landslide.
We can fight on this.
Ernest went down for the gun ban, Janice for taxes...
This is different.
We asked her to introduce the bill.
She knew that.
It's called a trial balloon.
Yeah, but it's also called a recorded vote.
She did that kind of thing for us.
She was our gal on the back bench.
She poured lighter fluid on the Republican leadership.
They're not gonna confirm her.
They're gonna make us look bad doing it.
And we still got half a new cabinet to confirm.
- They're starting.
- Thanks.
The Hopi Relocation guy?
Yeah.
Laney says the plane's still six hours out.
With a headwind that could buy us another hour.
The problem is...
- We don't have a doctor.
- What are you talking about?
There are only three who can do this.
Jorrey's in the middle of a heart valve replacement, Weingarten...
- Where's he?
- Rappelling the north face of K2.
- Rappelling up or rappelling down?
- It's in Pakistan.
What does it matter?
- It's not in Pakistan, you only think it is.
- Okay.
If I need a life-saving procedure, make sure the surgeon's suffering from massive oxygen deprivation.
- Who's the third?
- Dr. Ehsan Mohebi at Smith-Lansing.
- Oh, don't tell me.
- Yeah.
He fled Iran in '80 after fundamentalists tortured and killed his father.
The one guy who could save his son, and he tortured his father.
- That's just bad staff work.
Charlie!
- Are we sure about Japan?
One of these days they're gonna find the fairway.
Would you pull the first lady out of whatever she's in right now.
- She's with the Women's Caucus.
- Put on a helmet and get in there.
Make sure Mohebi's sitting by a phone.
He takes an elevator, we know the number.
- That's it.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
The National Committee's got a list of conventions where we asked the vice president to take our slot.
And the DPC sent me this list of his budget roll-outs and it's for last year.
I need all four.
Okay.
- What?
- The deadbeat Rackleys.
- I can't...
- Come on!
You called them deadbeats.
- For the sake of humor.
- Good one, Gracie.
- Who hasn't bounced a check?
- Me.
Yes, Mr. I-Balance-My-Checkbook-Every- Month-and-Don't-Ever-Bounce-Checks.
Everything you just said was a good thing and by saying it like Ethel Mertz...
Do you know what a congressman makes?
A buck and a half, 161,200 for the leadership.
To maintain two residences, fly your kids back and forth...
I know you like to hit with me, but go sit in the back of class because you just suggested that making only 150,000 a year was reasonable justification for committing a felony which is what it is, Lulu.
- What the hell is Lulu?
- It's To Sir With Love.
Thank you.
- I just need the lists.
- I have the lists.
That's why I'm asking you for them.
- Do you want them?
- Yes.
- We're talking about the lists?
- And you have them, and I want them.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, Terry.
- Bobby, sir.
- Yeah.
You pulled me out of the Women's Caucus.
No need to thank me.
Whatever happened to Mrs. Wilburforce?
She moved to Miami and took up massage.
- Really?
- Last I heard.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You asked me.
- Wasn't Mrs. Wilburforce our cat?
- She was our housekeeper.
Really?
All right, Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
It's a cyanotic heart condition.
There's something called ventricular septal defect...
The ayatollah's son has it.
Am I dreaming, or are you talking to me about foreign policy?
Worried the sky's gonna fall?
No, but I'm concerned about spousal abuse.
What's the problem?
There's a problem with State...?
- The only doctor available won't do it.
- He's Jewish?
- Persian.
- He doesn't have a choice.
- Abbey...
- He doesn't.
Doctors aren't instruments of state and aren't allowed to choose patients.
- I can't order him to do it.
- Yes, you can.
Through the power vested in me by you?
Samuel Mudd set Booth's leg after he shot Lincoln.
Doctors are liable if they don't treat the patient.
This is why we don't talk about foreign policy which we do, and you don't think we do it enough.
- Why?
- Because Samuel Mudd was tried and convicted of treason for that.
- So?
- What"so"?
So that's the way it goes, you set the leg.
- The patient right in front of them?
- Yes.
All right, go back to the sewing thing.
It's the Women's...
Never mind.
I couldn't tell you the last time I took a week away.
- You ought to take a vacation yourself.
- Yeah, I don't get Hawaii.
Great weather, great beaches, universal health care.
I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
You remember Neil Spencer, the rep from Honolulu who helped on the ag bill?
Spent all his time tanning on the Capitol balcony.
- If he went home without a tan...
- They'd know he'd gone Washington.
- We gotta talk politics.
- I'd like to.
I'm glad we had that little talk on Air Force Two.
From time to time...
We need you to stop shopping for precinct captains.
- Excuse me?
- We're days after an election.
- It's too early...
- Is that what this is about?
Triplehorn alone can tie us in knots.
Good for Triplehorn.
I've got an obligation to myself.
You've got a constitutional obligation.
Last time I checked, my constitutional obligation was to have a pulse.
We need these two years.
- It's our last chance to govern, John.
- Mr. Vice President.
- There are gonna be lots of ways...
- No zealot like a convert, Josh.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you'd have been great at Leo's job.
Half this town's gonna be running.
I do the president's politics.
He can't govern if I'm seen as...
Being for me?
I don't think there's much risk of that.
You were wrong.
I never went to Hawaii.
- What?
- We skipped Hawaii.
We went rafting on the Flathead River instead.
Don't touch that.
Or that.
"The boy's on the plane.
He's experiencing pulmonary hypertension."
That's elevated pressure in the lungs, I think.
That could lead to what?
- Doctor, that could lead to what?
- I'm sorry...
That could lead to what?
- Heart failure.
- That's what it says.
Follow me.
His right ventricular pressure has risen to 102 millimeters mercury.
Low-oxygen blood's beginning to bypass the lungs.
That's right.
He has something called"in situ thrombi."
His arteries have lost their anticoagulant properties, and I resent this.
Doctor Mohebi, I don't care.
Why aren't you scrubbing up?
People are taken from their homes in the dead of night and jailed and tortured for months.
- I know.
- Public executions...
- Doctor...
- Political opponents dragged outside...
- I know this.
Don't you think I know?
- I won't aid the enemy.
I'll let you know who the enemy is.
That's my job.
It's not a 15-year-old boy.
How do I know the organs were donated voluntarily?
- Doctors Without Borders.
- You don't know these people.
I do know these people.
You're crazy if you don't think I do.
I don't need to be told who the enemy is.
- Doctor...
- It's not your family that's still there.
My family's there.
- If the procedure isn't successful...
- Nothing will happen to them.
- Sir...
- Nothing will happen to them.
Who's making that guarantee?
Well, the Swiss, I guess.
Look, I'll use every power of the office to protect you and your family.
But can I just say that this is how things change for the better.
A world-class surgeon or a school teacher in Afjah who questions the ayatollah's divine power.
Do me a favor, go to Smith-Lansing and look at the kid because I think when you do, you're gonna scrub up.
If you don't, I respect that, and the man made his own bed.
Okay?
Yeah.
What was your father's name?
- Raji.
- What'd he teach?
- Science.
- Thank you.
Get him to Baltimore.
- You think his cell phone?
- Not white-water rafting.
And staff can't make those calls.
They're top-tier Iowa people and New Hampshire.
Forty, 50 calls from the Flathead River?
That really doesn't seem possible.
- Unless...
- That's what I'm saying.
All right, I'll take it.
C.E.Q.
- What do I tell Triplehorn?
- Tell him it's done.
- You're sure?
- Thank you, no, I...
They're playing the Eagles.
We're talking 50-yard line.
Toby?
You can't have the job.
Okay.
The Parks Bill, we made it Senate-confirmable.
- That's the first I've heard...
- They added it in conference.
- Well, we'll find something.
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
Can't be Museum Studies.
God forbid the Senate falls out of the mix on that.
I've made a lot of enemies on the Hill.
You don't owe me.
We asked you to fight a losing...
Yes, we owe you.
- This is when the president calls a play...
- I called the play.
I called it.
Raising the gas tax?
It was a loser, and I pushed to have you introduce it anyway.
That doesn't make any difference.
- Look, look, let's just...
- I came out for a gas tax because someone from Michigan had to.
Gas prices are too low.
It's why the air's polluted.
It's why no one wants alternative fuels.
And clearly that argument took the nation by storm.
In my religion, the whole symbol of the religion ended in crucifixion and condemnation.
That wasn't a measure of the experience.
It's just the way it ended.
Yeah, but I'm the Romans.
It's in the living.
It's in the campaigning that you make your mark.
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
You have until the end of the day on those tickets, by the way.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
- And congratulations.
- Okay.
- Do you know if the president's still in?
- He is.
Thanks.
- Mr. President, can you see Sam?
- Sure.
- Good evening, sir.
- You're the nominee.
There's no nominee.
Everyone's on the ballot.
- Is there another Democrat?
- No.
You're the nominee.
- Yeah.
- And I know how you feel.
- You like Scott Holcomb?
- I don't know him well.
He's terrific.
There's a good guy out there named Will Bailey if he should come across your radar.
You gonna campaign on prescription drugs?
Our drug bill, yes, sir.
And our Medicare reforms and the Bartlet Energy Plan.
- Sam?
- Yes, sir?
It's okay to run away from me when you need to.
I would never, Mr. President.
I simply would never do that.
- That's not how I get votes.
- I appreciate that but that's not what I'm talking about.
You disagreed with me on Medicare, I remember the meeting right here and then you wrote a five-page memo.
Run towards yourself.
I'm wrong about that.
Walk.
- You're not used to your surroundings.
- Yes, sir.
If you lose, you lose, but if you waste this, I'll just kill you, Sam.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Good evening, Mr. President.
- Hey.
- Thank-you notes?
- Yeah.
I'm going to bed.
You don't really like making thank-you calls, do you?
Spill it.
How many precinct captains did you line up for Hoynes?
- I didn't line up...
- Forty-seven.
Charlie showed me the call sheets.
I said thanks on behalf of the ticket.
I can't help it if...
Yeah.
They'll think what they want.
They think you're freezing the race for Hoynes.
I'm freezing it for us.
We just won four more years.
- This is not time for a free-for-all.
- This shouldn't be what you do anymore.
- Do I call them all back?
- We'll take care of it.
All right.
Tehran's gonna accelerate medium-range missile tests by two weeks.
We'll gather the NSC principals in the morning.
All right.
Anything else?
Salman Afkham was wheeled into surgery 15 minutes ago.
Mohebi's day just started.
Well, I suppose there are worse ways for ours to end.
Yeah, that's right.
Previously on The West Wing:
Andy's pregnant.
It's twins and, of course, I'm the father.
You know I'm gonna get sued.
- I work for Senator Hoynes.
- Yeah.
I wonder if I'd listened to you two years ago, would I be president right now?
- You did it for the widow?
- And for a guy named Will Bailey who ran the campaign and worked his ass off.
You might be asked tomorrow if you're endorsing me.
- Am I?
Toby, is the president endorsing Sam?
We think you should run.
- What do you think?
- I think you should win.
How do you interpret the margin of victory?
The votes have been counted and the people have spoken and it's clear that their will is for me to do and have anything I want.
Mr. President, Arnold White, Associated Press what's the first legislative priority?
- There's a new guy from AP?
- Yeah, what's your priority?
The president of Turkmenistan just officially extended the date of adolescence to 25.
So things like that.
I think he also renamed the month of January after himself.
That's greedy.
Real power is knowing when to leave something on the table.
- Sir, what legislative...?
- Patients' Bill of Rights, drugs keeping the economy growing, find a surplus again keep the surplus growing, use the surplus to build schools worthy of defending the military that Fitz and Hutchinson are gonna build to fight urban wars, then pay the teachers.
I asked for a legislative priority, you gave me nine.
It's a big country, Arnold.
Debbie, where the hell are you?
And where are my...?
You left your glasses in the mansion and the Ipswich clams in Chesapeake Bay can hear you bellowing right now.
Ipswich clams don't come from Chesapeake Bay.
They come from Ipswich.
- Not anymore.
- Have her beheaded for my birthday.
They'll ask you how you feel about housing starts going down.
I don't care as long as I'm keeping this one.
- GDP growth is strong.
- You bet your ass it is which, by the way, I can pad anytime I want now.
The voters have spoken.
Lowest inflation in 20 years.
Housing starts are cyclical, which is the thing.
What do you got?
- Flooding in Missouri.
- FEMA's on the ground?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I've got the Swiss ambassador in my office.
I don't know why.
You and I enjoy your funny jokes, but Idaho, not so much.
- Take it easy in there?
- I know my people.
Sometimes it's hard to believe I'm one of them.
Good luck.
Thank you.
- Ambassador Von Rutte.
- Okay.
- Thank you for seeing me.
- What's going on?
A communication from Tehran.
You understand our mission's the only one.
The president appreciates it.
The ayatollah's son has a congenital heart condition Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
His best chance is a simultaneous heart and lung transplant.
- They asked Japan?
- Procedures differ, they want yours.
- What's wrong with Japan's?
- Well, I don't know how to...
No one...
- It hasn't been successful?
- No.
Okay, then ours is better.
Anybody else do this?
- Just the U.S. and Japan.
- No, Japan doesn't do it yet.
Coming close doesn't matter on this, it's not the Gemini missions.
I'm gonna talk to the president, but if it means bumping an American off...
Iran has a donor.
- A donor or a dissenter?
- This is from Doctors Without Borders.
It wasn't from the ayatollah?
They were approached by the ayatollah's brother-in-law.
This is coming through you, through an NGO, through the brother-in-law.
Guy will put his son's life in the infidels' hands, but he'll keep his distance?
The hard-liners control the Majlis.
Things are difficult for him with the Shehab missile tests.
He cannot have a problem with his right flank.
Yeah, much better we should have a problem with ours.
- I'll talk to him.
- The president?
Don 't get me wrong, Mark, I think January's a good month.
Yeah, the president, generalissimo, whatever he comes back as.
- Messages.
- Goodwin at AP.
- What else?
- Judy Vanderbass wife of our ambassador to Vietnam, you've been to her house.
Yeah, I'm sure I ate a springer spaniel.
Why is AP on my phone sheet?
Triplehorn told him you're the reason there's no deal on prescription drugs.
- I'm the reason?
-"With Lyman negotiating..." Yeah.
- I feel ill-will toward the minority leader.
- I've had it up to here with the Welsh.
I'm not kidding.
He was campaigning with us a half-hour ago.
School's back.
Go see him.
Let's call that Plan A. Plan B is you see him.
- Karen Kroft.
- And National Parks screw me up again.
Yeah.
I'm gonna head to the leader's office.
Get me the first free minute he has.
And Judy Vanderbass?
Let's do this.
Find out what her problem is solve it, and then do something else.
- You're the reason there are term limits.
- Yeah?
You're the reason...
Nothing.
Nothing's happening.
Nothing's there.
- You seem fine.
- I am.
- You really seem fine.
- I really am.
Good.
The view from the canvas, it's educational, you know.
Yeah, I've had extensive education.
What was the final margin?
One hundred and twenty-seven votes.
- A hundred and twenty-seven.
- That's about 12 lawn signs.
- Wasn't your last election also...?
- Eighty-two votes.
The president says all you need is one, the rest is for ego.
- How many did the president win by?
- About three and a half million.
- Yeah.
- He's got a pretty healthy ego, though.
I don't know, maybe the job wasn't for me.
I like land.
I like dirt.
I like things that live on land and dirt.
I like hotels.
I like a good concierge.
Could you be a little more sympathetic?
I'm a loser.
Not a big one.
Okay.
The president thinks there's a place for you.
That's nice of you guys.
It really is.
But I was thinking about...
I was thinking about maybe trying for a job with the National Park Service.
- We were thinking the same thing.
- A job with the National Park Service?
As what?
The director of the National Park Service.
- Are you kidding me?
- No.
- You're not kidding?
- No.
- Is this just because...?
- Do you want it?
Yes.
Yes.
Then get yourself a big hat, and Leo's gonna call you in a couple hours.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy are the first three for tea.
- All's well that ends well.
- Karen Kroft.
National Parks chairman.
- Nice.
- She's very happy.
Andy's about to get sued for election fraud.
- Andy was trying to get sued for fraud.
- Really?
Yeah.
She's a pistol.
Everyone, please take your seats.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy are the first three for tea with the president at 3 p.m. in the Map Room.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy.
Next week it's Mark, Leslie and Eric.
- Who's running Sam's campaign?
- Sam's putting his team together.
I'm referring those questions to the campaign's press office.
John, Katie.
Will the president attend...?
Mr. Seaborn, how does it feel to have the nomination?
There is no nomination, there is a primary and if someone gets 50 percent of the vote, there is no general.
There are no other Democrats running.
They're endorsing you.
- Wouldn't you say you're the nominee?
- I suppose.
- Have you staffed the key positions yet?
- I'm gonna let Will Bailey answer.
Campaign manager is Scott Holcomb.
Finance director is Betsy Wadkins.
Communications director is Mark Stearns.
Excuse me for a second.
Can I talk to you?
Political director is Tom Baker.
The volunteer coordinator is Paula Montgomery.
- Over here, please.
- Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Scott's campaign manager?
What's your title?
- Citizen Bailey.
- I'm not kidding.
- I'm the chancellor of Germany.
- Will...
- What the hell's going on?
- Your team's in the field.
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, Will.
You and I had this conversation for two hours.
What are you doing?
- I don't think you should go.
- You made that clear.
- I'm doing this now.
- Listen, there are too many chiefs here.
- I'll get rid of some.
- No, you want them.
Scott Holcomb and Betsy, these guys are the best.
We just went from 435 House races to one.
You get the all-star team.
He doesn't want the best, he wants you.
Yes, but the Republicans are starting their starters, so you gotta match up.
We match up fine.
You got me into this.
Well, you got you into this but I owe you the best chance to win.
I owe that to Mr. Wilde.
Tell him that's ridiculous.
I took the race to show the DNC that no district should be ignored.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll stick around for a week and help and then I'm gonna take a vacation.
- Where?
- I don't know.
France, Italy, Wales.
Maybe EPCOT.
All right.
I've gotta head to Washington.
I'll see you day after tomorrow.
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you.
- Have a good flight, Sam.
- Thank you.
- EPCOT?
- I was kidding.
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.
- Sir?
- Yeah.
It's called penmanship, Watson.
Something your generation wouldn't know about because of the computers.
- How many of these things am I doing?
- Sixty.
- How many have I done?
- Three.
- Three?
- Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.
- Your system's slowing me down.
- I don't have a system.
- You're kidding?
- You ready?
Hey, can't we have color codings and stickers, priority lists?
- Can I get a little bureaucracy going?
- What are you doing?
I'm doing basically what the president does.
Ask people for things and then thank them for things.
Let's go.
Take the calls to the mansion.
I'll meet you there after this.
We had a couple of cats when the kids were kids named Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilburforce or something, I can't remember.
You know, I've never really liked human names for animals.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, I can't believe my kids didn't think to ask you what to name the cats.
But they used to bring mice into the house and show them to me.
This is how I'm starting to feel about the Swiss.
Yeah.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
Tell me about the boy.
He and a guardian have crossed into Kandahar.
A UN plane is on the ground.
It's gonna leave at 11:45 Zulu if you say okay.
- Eleven forty-five?
- Yes, sir.
- That's 11 minutes from now.
- Yes, sir.
This meeting's premature.
- We should wait 10 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
This meeting doesn't go in the Sit Room anymore, okay?
I don't know why it's here.
This isn't a military operation.
- It's a secure room.
- My office is a secure room too, isn't it?
Please, somebody tell me it is, or I gotta go pack some stuff.
- You see my point?
- What about the organs?
- The organs are in Zurich.
- I'm sorry, that sounded funny to me.
I'm the kid in bio who laughed all the time.
- Then on to Paris on Swiss Air.
- Coach?
- I don't...
- Then New York?
- Yes, sir.
- The heart and lungs get here first.
They can last about 40 hours, the flight from Tehran's 15.
What's left is to line up a doctor and get the funding.
- Go around the room.
- If it leaks, you got clerics.
It sends a message to the reformists.
At a time when they're breaking 70 percent in local elections.
If you're looking for ways to temper support to the Shiites, I don't...
- A benevolent power must...
- This isn't the time.
Don't forget the Shehab program and the transport corridors along the Silk Route.
How old is he?
- I'm sorry?
- How old is he?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.
The Shiites, Manny that's what you want me to take back to my thoracic surgeon wife?
Get this boy in preop.
Tell the Swiss to stop standing in the door with a mouse in their mouth.
- If they're coming in, come in.
- You won't regret it, sir.
It won't leak.
No, because we're in a secure room, except for the ayatollah's staff a Swiss Air pilot and 400 other people.
- Laney, is this gonna leak?
- Well...
I feel better already.
Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilburforce.
There's nothing wrong with my memory.
Though those are stupid names.
There's something wrong with my kids.
Come on, Josh.
The Senate's out of session you ought to think about putting a Ping-Pong table out here.
- I don't think that would be a good idea.
- Quick rounds between motions...
- Now just because the Senate's not...
- I'm kidding.
- You'd be surprised what people think.
- Read the AP wire.
- You know what that's about.
- Yeah, you're running for president.
We hold elections in this country, not coronations.
- I'm not saying any different.
- Then why is every...?
I must've...
I've talked to two dozen of your precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
- Nearly every one of them's locked up.
- They're locked...
You're recruiting precinct captains 48 months before the next election?
John Hoynes is using the White House to lock up the Democratic primaries.
If you're saying there's a nomination fight...
Hoynes doesn't inherit this.
I'm not gonna see the party dragged to the middle.
Nothing's being dragged anywhere.
You were with us just days ago.
- This is about the future of the party.
- Yeah, how about we enjoy the present?
You agree with Hoynes on guns?
On trade?
On school choice?
Look, Hoynes is...
Did I fall asleep for three and a half years?
You think a minority leader's irrelevant?
You think I can't affect the president's agenda?
- I know you can.
- I'd like you to be for me, Josh.
Not because you're good at what you do, because of your beliefs.
Okay, I'm not for anyone.
I barely unpacked from the last campaign.
Well, Hoynes is gonna have to release those precinct captains or we're...
It keeps getting earlier, doesn't it?
Yes.
And they're asking for you in the HHS meeting, and the 5: 15's new.
- The CEA?
- Ways to fight a possible recession.
- What did we say?
-"Don't say 'recession' in this building."
- You just did it again!
- What do I call the meeting?
The robust economy meeting.
- Josh is patching it up with Triplehorn.
- Good.
- And Karen Kroft wants National Parks.
- She can't have it.
- What are you talking about?
- She can't.
- We talked about it.
- The president signed the Parks Bill.
- The job just became Senate-confirmable.
- Yeah, that was for next fiscal year.
It turns out it's retroactive.
I just saw the final language.
Thanks.
- Whose idea...?
How did we miss this?
- There are 90 amendments in the bill.
- Maybe we put her up anyway.
- No.
- We asked her to do it.
- She led the charge for a higher gas tax.
- We asked her to do it.
- The Senate isn't gonna understand.
Plus, the minority leader is already pissed at us.
Okay, thanks.
Ginger.
Don't.
I need a list of sub-cabinet vacancies that aren't Senate-confirmable.
- Mine's not.
- A little less sub-cabinet than that one.
You wanna crash a space probe into Neptune, that's fine with me.
I think we've crashed into most of the other planets, but 2.5 billion, okay?
- Yes, sir.
- If we fail, I wanna do it on budget.
Thank you, Mr. President.
More thank-you notes?
Why don't you tell Debbie we're gonna do some calls.
- Calls?
- Yes, calls.
Calls.
Mr. Sarcasm with your dry"calls."
I was this close to renaming one of the oceans after you, but no way.
Maybe, maybe, one of the species of fish.
Like trout.
Trout is now Charlie.
Went to the lake, pulled out a Charlie for dinner.
Look at the size of that Charlie you've got on your wall.
Thank you, sir.
- What do you got?
- Yeah, we've got a situation.
- Yeah?
- Reuters has the ayatollah's son just left Afghanistan on a C-130.
Is he coming here for a heart transplant?
- Heart and lung.
- I'm assuming we knew about this.
- Knew about it?
We did it.
- The ayatollah's issued a statement.
- What kind?
- Bitterly denouncing it, sir.
"Our nation can take care of its own.
Interference from the West is an affront to Islam."
What's the room saying?
They think we're hiding Leo's meeting with the Swiss.
- So you know, the press coffee...
- Can't do it now.
Yes.
You're right.
- I need you to step out just a moment.
- Sure.
Thank you.
- We're not gonna not do it.
- I'm with you.
Hi.
Before you say anything, here's my idea.
The kid needs lungs and a heart.
Let's use the ayatollah's.
- What are you smiling at?
- I'm sorry, it's...
I'm sorry, sir.
It's the little note Margaret just passed me.
"The Iranians, they've taken to the streets." Perfect.
- That goes to the Margaret Museum.
- Please don't forget all politics are local.
- Bite me.
- He's gotta say something to...
He's got to say something to his hard-liners.
He didn't wanna try"My son is dying, and these guys maybe can fix him.
And maybe if our citizens didn't spend so much energy denouncing infidels they'd have time to build a damn medical school!"
The Swiss talked to the NGO, who talked to the brother-in-law who speaks for the ayatollah.
Just tell me that they weren't using cellular technology because I don't care what anybody says, it doesn't work yet.
Think about linking it to the missile tests.
- What do you mean?
- Send a communiqué through the Swiss.
The ayatollah's gotta honor Bahrain.
Stop all tests of the Shehab-3.
He's gonna say no.
That's when you tell him you're gonna turn the plane around.
- No.
- I said, you threaten...
No.
Come on.
That's a 15-year-old non-combatant on his way to a hospital.
Pretend that plane's got a big red cross on it.
- They perfect medium-range missiles.
- I understand.
- What's that do for hearts and lungs?
- Send a communiqué.
There's a Bahrain agreement that says...
Send it.
Don't even come close.
I don't even want a scent of linkage to...
A big damn red cross right on that plane.
Thanks for your help.
I'll let you know.
- I got this problem to put in perspective.
- What's the problem?
Triplehorn thinks I'm a secret operative for Hoynes.
- Are you?
- I don't believe I am.
- This ought to help.
- What?
- Vanderbass didn't invite you to dinner.
- Thank merciful God.
Turns out Trish Rackley, wife of your protégé she had a problem on the CODEL to Southeast Asia.
The rice?
No, really, the whole continent loves the stereotype.
- They eat a lot of rice, Donna.
- Mrs. Rackley borrowed $ 1500 from Judy Vanderbass to buy a teak bed for 2000, which is a good price.
- And?
- Mrs. Rackley's check bounced.
- Making it a great price.
- The Rackleys are stiffing her, Josh.
- What do you mean,"Josh"?
- You put him on the delegation.
I told State to look after him.
I didn't want him in trouble.
Phil Rackley's office won't return her calls.
Well, see if they'll return yours.
- Toby, Triplehorn's on fire.
- He needs to build a case against...
Hoynes is lining up precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
This is 10 minutes after the polls close in California.
And Winnick just called.
It's probably the same thing.
Half the Senate's gonna run.
If it looks like we're giving Hoynes...
Yeah.
You gotta back him off.
Okay, devil's advocate.
- Isn't Hoynes entitled?
- Yeah, but not yet.
It's just we got him on the ticket by convincing him it wasn't his turn.
We kept him out, because it wasn't his turn, and now...
There aren't any turns.
So these two people rob a Starbucks near Seattle.
Half an hour they serve coffee to make more money.
- Know when they make their getaway?
- When business slows down.
Beat that?
- When's Josh meeting with Hoynes?
- Soon.
What do you need?
Alternate federal co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission.
- What about it?
- It's Senate-confirmable.
- Really?
- So is commissioner of Hopi Relocation.
Let me tell you something about this job, you need a deep bench.
Inspector general of the Railroad Retirement Board director of the Institute of Museum Studies...
- My job's not.
- Ginger beat you to that joke.
- Karen lost her seat because of us.
- What do you want me to do?
Get used to the fact that we won in a landslide.
We can fight on this.
Ernest went down for the gun ban, Janice for taxes...
This is different.
We asked her to introduce the bill.
She knew that.
It's called a trial balloon.
Yeah, but it's also called a recorded vote.
She did that kind of thing for us.
She was our gal on the back bench.
She poured lighter fluid on the Republican leadership.
They're not gonna confirm her.
They're gonna make us look bad doing it.
And we still got half a new cabinet to confirm.
- They're starting.
- Thanks.
The Hopi Relocation guy?
Yeah.
Laney says the plane's still six hours out.
With a headwind that could buy us another hour.
The problem is...
- We don't have a doctor.
- What are you talking about?
There are only three who can do this.
Jorrey's in the middle of a heart valve replacement, Weingarten...
- Where's he?
- Rappelling the north face of K2.
- Rappelling up or rappelling down?
- It's in Pakistan.
What does it matter?
- It's not in Pakistan, you only think it is.
- Okay.
If I need a life-saving procedure, make sure the surgeon's suffering from massive oxygen deprivation.
- Who's the third?
- Dr. Ehsan Mohebi at Smith-Lansing.
- Oh, don't tell me.
- Yeah.
He fled Iran in '80 after fundamentalists tortured and killed his father.
The one guy who could save his son, and he tortured his father.
- That's just bad staff work.
Charlie!
- Are we sure about Japan?
One of these days they're gonna find the fairway.
Would you pull the first lady out of whatever she's in right now.
- She's with the Women's Caucus.
- Put on a helmet and get in there.
Make sure Mohebi's sitting by a phone.
He takes an elevator, we know the number.
- That's it.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
The National Committee's got a list of conventions where we asked the vice president to take our slot.
And the DPC sent me this list of his budget roll-outs and it's for last year.
I need all four.
Okay.
- What?
- The deadbeat Rackleys.
- I can't...
- Come on!
You called them deadbeats.
- For the sake of humor.
- Good one, Gracie.
- Who hasn't bounced a check?
- Me.
Yes, Mr. I-Balance-My-Checkbook-Every- Month-and-Don't-Ever-Bounce-Checks.
Everything you just said was a good thing and by saying it like Ethel Mertz...
Do you know what a congressman makes?
A buck and a half, 161,200 for the leadership.
To maintain two residences, fly your kids back and forth...
I know you like to hit with me, but go sit in the back of class because you just suggested that making only 150,000 a year was reasonable justification for committing a felony which is what it is, Lulu.
- What the hell is Lulu?
- It's To Sir With Love.
Thank you.
- I just need the lists.
- I have the lists.
That's why I'm asking you for them.
- Do you want them?
- Yes.
- We're talking about the lists?
- And you have them, and I want them.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, Terry.
- Bobby, sir.
- Yeah.
You pulled me out of the Women's Caucus.
No need to thank me.
Whatever happened to Mrs. Wilburforce?
She moved to Miami and took up massage.
- Really?
- Last I heard.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You asked me.
- Wasn't Mrs. Wilburforce our cat?
- She was our housekeeper.
Really?
All right, Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
It's a cyanotic heart condition.
There's something called ventricular septal defect...
The ayatollah's son has it.
Am I dreaming, or are you talking to me about foreign policy?
Worried the sky's gonna fall?
No, but I'm concerned about spousal abuse.
What's the problem?
There's a problem with State...?
- The only doctor available won't do it.
- He's Jewish?
- Persian.
- He doesn't have a choice.
- Abbey...
- He doesn't.
Doctors aren't instruments of state and aren't allowed to choose patients.
- I can't order him to do it.
- Yes, you can.
Through the power vested in me by you?
Samuel Mudd set Booth's leg after he shot Lincoln.
Doctors are liable if they don't treat the patient.
This is why we don't talk about foreign policy which we do, and you don't think we do it enough.
- Why?
- Because Samuel Mudd was tried and convicted of treason for that.
- So?
- What"so"?
So that's the way it goes, you set the leg.
- The patient right in front of them?
- Yes.
All right, go back to the sewing thing.
It's the Women's...
Never mind.
I couldn't tell you the last time I took a week away.
- You ought to take a vacation yourself.
- Yeah, I don't get Hawaii.
Great weather, great beaches, universal health care.
I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
You remember Neil Spencer, the rep from Honolulu who helped on the ag bill?
Spent all his time tanning on the Capitol balcony.
- If he went home without a tan...
- They'd know he'd gone Washington.
- We gotta talk politics.
- I'd like to.
I'm glad we had that little talk on Air Force Two.
From time to time...
We need you to stop shopping for precinct captains.
- Excuse me?
- We're days after an election.
- It's too early...
- Is that what this is about?
Triplehorn alone can tie us in knots.
Good for Triplehorn.
I've got an obligation to myself.
You've got a constitutional obligation.
Last time I checked, my constitutional obligation was to have a pulse.
We need these two years.
- It's our last chance to govern, John.
- Mr. Vice President.
- There are gonna be lots of ways...
- No zealot like a convert, Josh.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you'd have been great at Leo's job.
Half this town's gonna be running.
I do the president's politics.
He can't govern if I'm seen as...
Being for me?
I don't think there's much risk of that.
You were wrong.
I never went to Hawaii.
- What?
- We skipped Hawaii.
We went rafting on the Flathead River instead.
Don't touch that.
Or that.
"The boy's on the plane.
He's experiencing pulmonary hypertension."
That's elevated pressure in the lungs, I think.
That could lead to what?
- Doctor, that could lead to what?
- I'm sorry...
That could lead to what?
- Heart failure.
- That's what it says.
Follow me.
His right ventricular pressure has risen to 102 millimeters mercury.
Low-oxygen blood's beginning to bypass the lungs.
That's right.
He has something called"in situ thrombi."
His arteries have lost their anticoagulant properties, and I resent this.
Doctor Mohebi, I don't care.
Why aren't you scrubbing up?
People are taken from their homes in the dead of night and jailed and tortured for months.
- I know.
- Public executions...
- Doctor...
- Political opponents dragged outside...
- I know this.
Don't you think I know?
- I won't aid the enemy.
I'll let you know who the enemy is.
That's my job.
It's not a 15-year-old boy.
How do I know the organs were donated voluntarily?
- Doctors Without Borders.
- You don't know these people.
I do know these people.
You're crazy if you don't think I do.
I don't need to be told who the enemy is.
- Doctor...
- It's not your family that's still there.
My family's there.
- If the procedure isn't successful...
- Nothing will happen to them.
- Sir...
- Nothing will happen to them.
Who's making that guarantee?
Well, the Swiss, I guess.
Look, I'll use every power of the office to protect you and your family.
But can I just say that this is how things change for the better.
A world-class surgeon or a school teacher in Afjah who questions the ayatollah's divine power.
Do me a favor, go to Smith-Lansing and look at the kid because I think when you do, you're gonna scrub up.
If you don't, I respect that, and the man made his own bed.
Okay?
Yeah.
What was your father's name?
- Raji.
- What'd he teach?
- Science.
- Thank you.
Get him to Baltimore.
- You think his cell phone?
- Not white-water rafting.
And staff can't make those calls.
They're top-tier Iowa people and New Hampshire.
Forty, 50 calls from the Flathead River?
That really doesn't seem possible.
- Unless...
- That's what I'm saying.
All right, I'll take it.
C.E.Q.
- What do I tell Triplehorn?
- Tell him it's done.
- You're sure?
- Thank you, no, I...
They're playing the Eagles.
We're talking 50-yard line.
Toby?
You can't have the job.
Okay.
The Parks Bill, we made it Senate-confirmable.
- That's the first I've heard...
- They added it in conference.
- Well, we'll find something.
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
Can't be Museum Studies.
God forbid the Senate falls out of the mix on that.
I've made a lot of enemies on the Hill.
You don't owe me.
We asked you to fight a losing...
Yes, we owe you.
- This is when the president calls a play...
- I called the play.
I called it.
Raising the gas tax?
It was a loser, and I pushed to have you introduce it anyway.
That doesn't make any difference.
- Look, look, let's just...
- I came out for a gas tax because someone from Michigan had to.
Gas prices are too low.
It's why the air's polluted.
It's why no one wants alternative fuels.
And clearly that argument took the nation by storm.
In my religion, the whole symbol of the religion ended in crucifixion and condemnation.
That wasn't a measure of the experience.
It's just the way it ended.
Yeah, but I'm the Romans.
It's in the living.
It's in the campaigning that you make your mark.
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
You have until the end of the day on those tickets, by the way.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
- And congratulations.
- Okay.
- Do you know if the president's still in?
- He is.
Thanks.
- Mr. President, can you see Sam?
- Sure.
- Good evening, sir.
- You're the nominee.
There's no nominee.
Everyone's on the ballot.
- Is there another Democrat?
- No.
You're the nominee.
- Yeah.
- And I know how you feel.
- You like Scott Holcomb?
- I don't know him well.
He's terrific.
There's a good guy out there named Will Bailey if he should come across your radar.
You gonna campaign on prescription drugs?
Our drug bill, yes, sir.
And our Medicare reforms and the Bartlet Energy Plan.
- Sam?
- Yes, sir?
It's okay to run away from me when you need to.
I would never, Mr. President.
I simply would never do that.
- That's not how I get votes.
- I appreciate that but that's not what I'm talking about.
You disagreed with me on Medicare, I remember the meeting right here and then you wrote a five-page memo.
Run towards yourself.
I'm wrong about that.
Walk.
- You're not used to your surroundings.
- Yes, sir.
If you lose, you lose, but if you waste this, I'll just kill you, Sam.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Good evening, Mr. President.
- Hey.
- Thank-you notes?
- Yeah.
I'm going to bed.
You don't really like making thank-you calls, do you?
Spill it.
How many precinct captains did you line up for Hoynes?
- I didn't line up...
- Forty-seven.
Charlie showed me the call sheets.
I said thanks on behalf of the ticket.
I can't help it if...
Yeah.
They'll think what they want.
They think you're freezing the race for Hoynes.
I'm freezing it for us.
We just won four more years.
- This is not time for a free-for-all.
- This shouldn't be what you do anymore.
- Do I call them all back?
- We'll take care of it.
All right.
Tehran's gonna accelerate medium-range missile tests by two weeks.
We'll gather the NSC principals in the morning.
All right.
Anything else?
Salman Afkham was wheeled into surgery 15 minutes ago.
Mohebi's day just started.
Well, I suppose there are worse ways for ours to end.
Yeah, that's right.
Previously on The West Wing:
Andy's pregnant.
It's twins and, of course, I'm the father.
You know I'm gonna get sued.
- I work for Senator Hoynes.
- Yeah.
I wonder if I'd listened to you two years ago, would I be president right now?
- You did it for the widow?
- And for a guy named Will Bailey who ran the campaign and worked his ass off.
You might be asked tomorrow if you're endorsing me.
- Am I?
Toby, is the president endorsing Sam?
We think you should run.
- What do you think?
- I think you should win.
How do you interpret the margin of victory?
The votes have been counted and the people have spoken and it's clear that their will is for me to do and have anything I want.
Mr. President, Arnold White, Associated Press what's the first legislative priority?
- There's a new guy from AP?
- Yeah, what's your priority?
The president of Turkmenistan just officially extended the date of adolescence to 25.
So things like that.
I think he also renamed the month of January after himself.
That's greedy.
Real power is knowing when to leave something on the table.
- Sir, what legislative...?
- Patients' Bill of Rights, drugs keeping the economy growing, find a surplus again keep the surplus growing, use the surplus to build schools worthy of defending the military that Fitz and Hutchinson are gonna build to fight urban wars, then pay the teachers.
I asked for a legislative priority, you gave me nine.
It's a big country, Arnold.
Debbie, where the hell are you?
And where are my...?
You left your glasses in the mansion and the Ipswich clams in Chesapeake Bay can hear you bellowing right now.
Ipswich clams don't come from Chesapeake Bay.
They come from Ipswich.
- Not anymore.
- Have her beheaded for my birthday.
They'll ask you how you feel about housing starts going down.
I don't care as long as I'm keeping this one.
- GDP growth is strong.
- You bet your ass it is which, by the way, I can pad anytime I want now.
The voters have spoken.
Lowest inflation in 20 years.
Housing starts are cyclical, which is the thing.
What do you got?
- Flooding in Missouri.
- FEMA's on the ground?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I've got the Swiss ambassador in my office.
I don't know why.
You and I enjoy your funny jokes, but Idaho, not so much.
- Take it easy in there?
- I know my people.
Sometimes it's hard to believe I'm one of them.
Good luck.
Thank you.
- Ambassador Von Rutte.
- Okay.
- Thank you for seeing me.
- What's going on?
A communication from Tehran.
You understand our mission's the only one.
The president appreciates it.
The ayatollah's son has a congenital heart condition Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
His best chance is a simultaneous heart and lung transplant.
- They asked Japan?
- Procedures differ, they want yours.
- What's wrong with Japan's?
- Well, I don't know how to...
No one...
- It hasn't been successful?
- No.
Okay, then ours is better.
Anybody else do this?
- Just the U.S. and Japan.
- No, Japan doesn't do it yet.
Coming close doesn't matter on this, it's not the Gemini missions.
I'm gonna talk to the president, but if it means bumping an American off...
Iran has a donor.
- A donor or a dissenter?
- This is from Doctors Without Borders.
It wasn't from the ayatollah?
They were approached by the ayatollah's brother-in-law.
This is coming through you, through an NGO, through the brother-in-law.
Guy will put his son's life in the infidels' hands, but he'll keep his distance?
The hard-liners control the Majlis.
Things are difficult for him with the Shehab missile tests.
He cannot have a problem with his right flank.
Yeah, much better we should have a problem with ours.
- I'll talk to him.
- The president?
Don 't get me wrong, Mark, I think January's a good month.
Yeah, the president, generalissimo, whatever he comes back as.
- Messages.
- Goodwin at AP.
- What else?
- Judy Vanderbass wife of our ambassador to Vietnam, you've been to her house.
Yeah, I'm sure I ate a springer spaniel.
Why is AP on my phone sheet?
Triplehorn told him you're the reason there's no deal on prescription drugs.
- I'm the reason?
-"With Lyman negotiating..." Yeah.
- I feel ill-will toward the minority leader.
- I've had it up to here with the Welsh.
I'm not kidding.
He was campaigning with us a half-hour ago.
School's back.
Go see him.
Let's call that Plan A. Plan B is you see him.
- Karen Kroft.
- And National Parks screw me up again.
Yeah.
I'm gonna head to the leader's office.
Get me the first free minute he has.
And Judy Vanderbass?
Let's do this.
Find out what her problem is solve it, and then do something else.
- You're the reason there are term limits.
- Yeah?
You're the reason...
Nothing.
Nothing's happening.
Nothing's there.
- You seem fine.
- I am.
- You really seem fine.
- I really am.
Good.
The view from the canvas, it's educational, you know.
Yeah, I've had extensive education.
What was the final margin?
One hundred and twenty-seven votes.
- A hundred and twenty-seven.
- That's about 12 lawn signs.
- Wasn't your last election also...?
- Eighty-two votes.
The president says all you need is one, the rest is for ego.
- How many did the president win by?
- About three and a half million.
- Yeah.
- He's got a pretty healthy ego, though.
I don't know, maybe the job wasn't for me.
I like land.
I like dirt.
I like things that live on land and dirt.
I like hotels.
I like a good concierge.
Could you be a little more sympathetic?
I'm a loser.
Not a big one.
Okay.
The president thinks there's a place for you.
That's nice of you guys.
It really is.
But I was thinking about...
I was thinking about maybe trying for a job with the National Park Service.
- We were thinking the same thing.
- A job with the National Park Service?
As what?
The director of the National Park Service.
- Are you kidding me?
- No.
- You're not kidding?
- No.
- Is this just because...?
- Do you want it?
Yes.
Yes.
Then get yourself a big hat, and Leo's gonna call you in a couple hours.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy are the first three for tea.
- All's well that ends well.
- Karen Kroft.
National Parks chairman.
- Nice.
- She's very happy.
Andy's about to get sued for election fraud.
- Andy was trying to get sued for fraud.
- Really?
Yeah.
She's a pistol.
Everyone, please take your seats.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy are the first three for tea with the president at 3 p.m. in the Map Room.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy.
Next week it's Mark, Leslie and Eric.
- Who's running Sam's campaign?
- Sam's putting his team together.
I'm referring those questions to the campaign's press office.
John, Katie.
Will the president attend...?
Mr. Seaborn, how does it feel to have the nomination?
There is no nomination, there is a primary and if someone gets 50 percent of the vote, there is no general.
There are no other Democrats running.
They're endorsing you.
- Wouldn't you say you're the nominee?
- I suppose.
- Have you staffed the key positions yet?
- I'm gonna let Will Bailey answer.
Campaign manager is Scott Holcomb.
Finance director is Betsy Wadkins.
Communications director is Mark Stearns.
Excuse me for a second.
Can I talk to you?
Political director is Tom Baker.
The volunteer coordinator is Paula Montgomery.
- Over here, please.
- Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Scott's campaign manager?
What's your title?
- Citizen Bailey.
- I'm not kidding.
- I'm the chancellor of Germany.
- Will...
- What the hell's going on?
- Your team's in the field.
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, Will.
You and I had this conversation for two hours.
What are you doing?
- I don't think you should go.
- You made that clear.
- I'm doing this now.
- Listen, there are too many chiefs here.
- I'll get rid of some.
- No, you want them.
Scott Holcomb and Betsy, these guys are the best.
We just went from 435 House races to one.
You get the all-star team.
He doesn't want the best, he wants you.
Yes, but the Republicans are starting their starters, so you gotta match up.
We match up fine.
You got me into this.
Well, you got you into this but I owe you the best chance to win.
I owe that to Mr. Wilde.
Tell him that's ridiculous.
I took the race to show the DNC that no district should be ignored.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll stick around for a week and help and then I'm gonna take a vacation.
- Where?
- I don't know.
France, Italy, Wales.
Maybe EPCOT.
All right.
I've gotta head to Washington.
I'll see you day after tomorrow.
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you.
- Have a good flight, Sam.
- Thank you.
- EPCOT?
- I was kidding.
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.
- Sir?
- Yeah.
It's called penmanship, Watson.
Something your generation wouldn't know about because of the computers.
- How many of these things am I doing?
- Sixty.
- How many have I done?
- Three.
- Three?
- Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.
- Your system's slowing me down.
- I don't have a system.
- You're kidding?
- You ready?
Hey, can't we have color codings and stickers, priority lists?
- Can I get a little bureaucracy going?
- What are you doing?
I'm doing basically what the president does.
Ask people for things and then thank them for things.
Let's go.
Take the calls to the mansion.
I'll meet you there after this.
We had a couple of cats when the kids were kids named Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilburforce or something, I can't remember.
You know, I've never really liked human names for animals.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, I can't believe my kids didn't think to ask you what to name the cats.
But they used to bring mice into the house and show them to me.
This is how I'm starting to feel about the Swiss.
Yeah.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
Tell me about the boy.
He and a guardian have crossed into Kandahar.
A UN plane is on the ground.
It's gonna leave at 11:45 Zulu if you say okay.
- Eleven forty-five?
- Yes, sir.
- That's 11 minutes from now.
- Yes, sir.
This meeting's premature.
- We should wait 10 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
This meeting doesn't go in the Sit Room anymore, okay?
I don't know why it's here.
This isn't a military operation.
- It's a secure room.
- My office is a secure room too, isn't it?
Please, somebody tell me it is, or I gotta go pack some stuff.
- You see my point?
- What about the organs?
- The organs are in Zurich.
- I'm sorry, that sounded funny to me.
I'm the kid in bio who laughed all the time.
- Then on to Paris on Swiss Air.
- Coach?
- I don't...
- Then New York?
- Yes, sir.
- The heart and lungs get here first.
They can last about 40 hours, the flight from Tehran's 15.
What's left is to line up a doctor and get the funding.
- Go around the room.
- If it leaks, you got clerics.
It sends a message to the reformists.
At a time when they're breaking 70 percent in local elections.
If you're looking for ways to temper support to the Shiites, I don't...
- A benevolent power must...
- This isn't the time.
Don't forget the Shehab program and the transport corridors along the Silk Route.
How old is he?
- I'm sorry?
- How old is he?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.
The Shiites, Manny that's what you want me to take back to my thoracic surgeon wife?
Get this boy in preop.
Tell the Swiss to stop standing in the door with a mouse in their mouth.
- If they're coming in, come in.
- You won't regret it, sir.
It won't leak.
No, because we're in a secure room, except for the ayatollah's staff a Swiss Air pilot and 400 other people.
- Laney, is this gonna leak?
- Well...
I feel better already.
Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilburforce.
There's nothing wrong with my memory.
Though those are stupid names.
There's something wrong with my kids.
Come on, Josh.
The Senate's out of session you ought to think about putting a Ping-Pong table out here.
- I don't think that would be a good idea.
- Quick rounds between motions...
- Now just because the Senate's not...
- I'm kidding.
- You'd be surprised what people think.
- Read the AP wire.
- You know what that's about.
- Yeah, you're running for president.
We hold elections in this country, not coronations.
- I'm not saying any different.
- Then why is every...?
I must've...
I've talked to two dozen of your precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
- Nearly every one of them's locked up.
- They're locked...
You're recruiting precinct captains 48 months before the next election?
John Hoynes is using the White House to lock up the Democratic primaries.
If you're saying there's a nomination fight...
Hoynes doesn't inherit this.
I'm not gonna see the party dragged to the middle.
Nothing's being dragged anywhere.
You were with us just days ago.
- This is about the future of the party.
- Yeah, how about we enjoy the present?
You agree with Hoynes on guns?
On trade?
On school choice?
Look, Hoynes is...
Did I fall asleep for three and a half years?
You think a minority leader's irrelevant?
You think I can't affect the president's agenda?
- I know you can.
- I'd like you to be for me, Josh.
Not because you're good at what you do, because of your beliefs.
Okay, I'm not for anyone.
I barely unpacked from the last campaign.
Well, Hoynes is gonna have to release those precinct captains or we're...
It keeps getting earlier, doesn't it?
Yes.
And they're asking for you in the HHS meeting, and the 5: 15's new.
- The CEA?
- Ways to fight a possible recession.
- What did we say?
-"Don't say 'recession' in this building."
- You just did it again!
- What do I call the meeting?
The robust economy meeting.
- Josh is patching it up with Triplehorn.
- Good.
- And Karen Kroft wants National Parks.
- She can't have it.
- What are you talking about?
- She can't.
- We talked about it.
- The president signed the Parks Bill.
- The job just became Senate-confirmable.
- Yeah, that was for next fiscal year.
It turns out it's retroactive.
I just saw the final language.
Thanks.
- Whose idea...?
How did we miss this?
- There are 90 amendments in the bill.
- Maybe we put her up anyway.
- No.
- We asked her to do it.
- She led the charge for a higher gas tax.
- We asked her to do it.
- The Senate isn't gonna understand.
Plus, the minority leader is already pissed at us.
Okay, thanks.
Ginger.
Don't.
I need a list of sub-cabinet vacancies that aren't Senate-confirmable.
- Mine's not.
- A little less sub-cabinet than that one.
You wanna crash a space probe into Neptune, that's fine with me.
I think we've crashed into most of the other planets, but 2.5 billion, okay?
- Yes, sir.
- If we fail, I wanna do it on budget.
Thank you, Mr. President.
More thank-you notes?
Why don't you tell Debbie we're gonna do some calls.
- Calls?
- Yes, calls.
Calls.
Mr. Sarcasm with your dry"calls."
I was this close to renaming one of the oceans after you, but no way.
Maybe, maybe, one of the species of fish.
Like trout.
Trout is now Charlie.
Went to the lake, pulled out a Charlie for dinner.
Look at the size of that Charlie you've got on your wall.
Thank you, sir.
- What do you got?
- Yeah, we've got a situation.
- Yeah?
- Reuters has the ayatollah's son just left Afghanistan on a C-130.
Is he coming here for a heart transplant?
- Heart and lung.
- I'm assuming we knew about this.
- Knew about it?
We did it.
- The ayatollah's issued a statement.
- What kind?
- Bitterly denouncing it, sir.
"Our nation can take care of its own.
Interference from the West is an affront to Islam."
What's the room saying?
They think we're hiding Leo's meeting with the Swiss.
- So you know, the press coffee...
- Can't do it now.
Yes.
You're right.
- I need you to step out just a moment.
- Sure.
Thank you.
- We're not gonna not do it.
- I'm with you.
Hi.
Before you say anything, here's my idea.
The kid needs lungs and a heart.
Let's use the ayatollah's.
- What are you smiling at?
- I'm sorry, it's...
I'm sorry, sir.
It's the little note Margaret just passed me.
"The Iranians, they've taken to the streets." Perfect.
- That goes to the Margaret Museum.
- Please don't forget all politics are local.
- Bite me.
- He's gotta say something to...
He's got to say something to his hard-liners.
He didn't wanna try"My son is dying, and these guys maybe can fix him.
And maybe if our citizens didn't spend so much energy denouncing infidels they'd have time to build a damn medical school!"
The Swiss talked to the NGO, who talked to the brother-in-law who speaks for the ayatollah.
Just tell me that they weren't using cellular technology because I don't care what anybody says, it doesn't work yet.
Think about linking it to the missile tests.
- What do you mean?
- Send a communiqué through the Swiss.
The ayatollah's gotta honor Bahrain.
Stop all tests of the Shehab-3.
He's gonna say no.
That's when you tell him you're gonna turn the plane around.
- No.
- I said, you threaten...
No.
Come on.
That's a 15-year-old non-combatant on his way to a hospital.
Pretend that plane's got a big red cross on it.
- They perfect medium-range missiles.
- I understand.
- What's that do for hearts and lungs?
- Send a communiqué.
There's a Bahrain agreement that says...
Send it.
Don't even come close.
I don't even want a scent of linkage to...
A big damn red cross right on that plane.
Thanks for your help.
I'll let you know.
- I got this problem to put in perspective.
- What's the problem?
Triplehorn thinks I'm a secret operative for Hoynes.
- Are you?
- I don't believe I am.
- This ought to help.
- What?
- Vanderbass didn't invite you to dinner.
- Thank merciful God.
Turns out Trish Rackley, wife of your protégé she had a problem on the CODEL to Southeast Asia.
The rice?
No, really, the whole continent loves the stereotype.
- They eat a lot of rice, Donna.
- Mrs. Rackley borrowed $ 1500 from Judy Vanderbass to buy a teak bed for 2000, which is a good price.
- And?
- Mrs. Rackley's check bounced.
- Making it a great price.
- The Rackleys are stiffing her, Josh.
- What do you mean,"Josh"?
- You put him on the delegation.
I told State to look after him.
I didn't want him in trouble.
Phil Rackley's office won't return her calls.
Well, see if they'll return yours.
- Toby, Triplehorn's on fire.
- He needs to build a case against...
Hoynes is lining up precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
This is 10 minutes after the polls close in California.
And Winnick just called.
It's probably the same thing.
Half the Senate's gonna run.
If it looks like we're giving Hoynes...
Yeah.
You gotta back him off.
Okay, devil's advocate.
- Isn't Hoynes entitled?
- Yeah, but not yet.
It's just we got him on the ticket by convincing him it wasn't his turn.
We kept him out, because it wasn't his turn, and now...
There aren't any turns.
So these two people rob a Starbucks near Seattle.
Half an hour they serve coffee to make more money.
- Know when they make their getaway?
- When business slows down.
Beat that?
- When's Josh meeting with Hoynes?
- Soon.
What do you need?
Alternate federal co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission.
- What about it?
- It's Senate-confirmable.
- Really?
- So is commissioner of Hopi Relocation.
Let me tell you something about this job, you need a deep bench.
Inspector general of the Railroad Retirement Board director of the Institute of Museum Studies...
- My job's not.
- Ginger beat you to that joke.
- Karen lost her seat because of us.
- What do you want me to do?
Get used to the fact that we won in a landslide.
We can fight on this.
Ernest went down for the gun ban, Janice for taxes...
This is different.
We asked her to introduce the bill.
She knew that.
It's called a trial balloon.
Yeah, but it's also called a recorded vote.
She did that kind of thing for us.
She was our gal on the back bench.
She poured lighter fluid on the Republican leadership.
They're not gonna confirm her.
They're gonna make us look bad doing it.
And we still got half a new cabinet to confirm.
- They're starting.
- Thanks.
The Hopi Relocation guy?
Yeah.
Laney says the plane's still six hours out.
With a headwind that could buy us another hour.
The problem is...
- We don't have a doctor.
- What are you talking about?
There are only three who can do this.
Jorrey's in the middle of a heart valve replacement, Weingarten...
- Where's he?
- Rappelling the north face of K2.
- Rappelling up or rappelling down?
- It's in Pakistan.
What does it matter?
- It's not in Pakistan, you only think it is.
- Okay.
If I need a life-saving procedure, make sure the surgeon's suffering from massive oxygen deprivation.
- Who's the third?
- Dr. Ehsan Mohebi at Smith-Lansing.
- Oh, don't tell me.
- Yeah.
He fled Iran in '80 after fundamentalists tortured and killed his father.
The one guy who could save his son, and he tortured his father.
- That's just bad staff work.
Charlie!
- Are we sure about Japan?
One of these days they're gonna find the fairway.
Would you pull the first lady out of whatever she's in right now.
- She's with the Women's Caucus.
- Put on a helmet and get in there.
Make sure Mohebi's sitting by a phone.
He takes an elevator, we know the number.
- That's it.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
The National Committee's got a list of conventions where we asked the vice president to take our slot.
And the DPC sent me this list of his budget roll-outs and it's for last year.
I need all four.
Okay.
- What?
- The deadbeat Rackleys.
- I can't...
- Come on!
You called them deadbeats.
- For the sake of humor.
- Good one, Gracie.
- Who hasn't bounced a check?
- Me.
Yes, Mr. I-Balance-My-Checkbook-Every- Month-and-Don't-Ever-Bounce-Checks.
Everything you just said was a good thing and by saying it like Ethel Mertz...
Do you know what a congressman makes?
A buck and a half, 161,200 for the leadership.
To maintain two residences, fly your kids back and forth...
I know you like to hit with me, but go sit in the back of class because you just suggested that making only 150,000 a year was reasonable justification for committing a felony which is what it is, Lulu.
- What the hell is Lulu?
- It's To Sir With Love.
Thank you.
- I just need the lists.
- I have the lists.
That's why I'm asking you for them.
- Do you want them?
- Yes.
- We're talking about the lists?
- And you have them, and I want them.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, Terry.
- Bobby, sir.
- Yeah.
You pulled me out of the Women's Caucus.
No need to thank me.
Whatever happened to Mrs. Wilburforce?
She moved to Miami and took up massage.
- Really?
- Last I heard.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You asked me.
- Wasn't Mrs. Wilburforce our cat?
- She was our housekeeper.
Really?
All right, Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
It's a cyanotic heart condition.
There's something called ventricular septal defect...
The ayatollah's son has it.
Am I dreaming, or are you talking to me about foreign policy?
Worried the sky's gonna fall?
No, but I'm concerned about spousal abuse.
What's the problem?
There's a problem with State...?
- The only doctor available won't do it.
- He's Jewish?
- Persian.
- He doesn't have a choice.
- Abbey...
- He doesn't.
Doctors aren't instruments of state and aren't allowed to choose patients.
- I can't order him to do it.
- Yes, you can.
Through the power vested in me by you?
Samuel Mudd set Booth's leg after he shot Lincoln.
Doctors are liable if they don't treat the patient.
This is why we don't talk about foreign policy which we do, and you don't think we do it enough.
- Why?
- Because Samuel Mudd was tried and convicted of treason for that.
- So?
- What"so"?
So that's the way it goes, you set the leg.
- The patient right in front of them?
- Yes.
All right, go back to the sewing thing.
It's the Women's...
Never mind.
I couldn't tell you the last time I took a week away.
- You ought to take a vacation yourself.
- Yeah, I don't get Hawaii.
Great weather, great beaches, universal health care.
I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
You remember Neil Spencer, the rep from Honolulu who helped on the ag bill?
Spent all his time tanning on the Capitol balcony.
- If he went home without a tan...
- They'd know he'd gone Washington.
- We gotta talk politics.
- I'd like to.
I'm glad we had that little talk on Air Force Two.
From time to time...
We need you to stop shopping for precinct captains.
- Excuse me?
- We're days after an election.
- It's too early...
- Is that what this is about?
Triplehorn alone can tie us in knots.
Good for Triplehorn.
I've got an obligation to myself.
You've got a constitutional obligation.
Last time I checked, my constitutional obligation was to have a pulse.
We need these two years.
- It's our last chance to govern, John.
- Mr. Vice President.
- There are gonna be lots of ways...
- No zealot like a convert, Josh.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you'd have been great at Leo's job.
Half this town's gonna be running.
I do the president's politics.
He can't govern if I'm seen as...
Being for me?
I don't think there's much risk of that.
You were wrong.
I never went to Hawaii.
- What?
- We skipped Hawaii.
We went rafting on the Flathead River instead.
Don't touch that.
Or that.
"The boy's on the plane.
He's experiencing pulmonary hypertension."
That's elevated pressure in the lungs, I think.
That could lead to what?
- Doctor, that could lead to what?
- I'm sorry...
That could lead to what?
- Heart failure.
- That's what it says.
Follow me.
His right ventricular pressure has risen to 102 millimeters mercury.
Low-oxygen blood's beginning to bypass the lungs.
That's right.
He has something called"in situ thrombi."
His arteries have lost their anticoagulant properties, and I resent this.
Doctor Mohebi, I don't care.
Why aren't you scrubbing up?
People are taken from their homes in the dead of night and jailed and tortured for months.
- I know.
- Public executions...
- Doctor...
- Political opponents dragged outside...
- I know this.
Don't you think I know?
- I won't aid the enemy.
I'll let you know who the enemy is.
That's my job.
It's not a 15-year-old boy.
How do I know the organs were donated voluntarily?
- Doctors Without Borders.
- You don't know these people.
I do know these people.
You're crazy if you don't think I do.
I don't need to be told who the enemy is.
- Doctor...
- It's not your family that's still there.
My family's there.
- If the procedure isn't successful...
- Nothing will happen to them.
- Sir...
- Nothing will happen to them.
Who's making that guarantee?
Well, the Swiss, I guess.
Look, I'll use every power of the office to protect you and your family.
But can I just say that this is how things change for the better.
A world-class surgeon or a school teacher in Afjah who questions the ayatollah's divine power.
Do me a favor, go to Smith-Lansing and look at the kid because I think when you do, you're gonna scrub up.
If you don't, I respect that, and the man made his own bed.
Okay?
Yeah.
What was your father's name?
- Raji.
- What'd he teach?
- Science.
- Thank you.
Get him to Baltimore.
- You think his cell phone?
- Not white-water rafting.
And staff can't make those calls.
They're top-tier Iowa people and New Hampshire.
Forty, 50 calls from the Flathead River?
That really doesn't seem possible.
- Unless...
- That's what I'm saying.
All right, I'll take it.
C.E.Q.
- What do I tell Triplehorn?
- Tell him it's done.
- You're sure?
- Thank you, no, I...
They're playing the Eagles.
We're talking 50-yard line.
Toby?
You can't have the job.
Okay.
The Parks Bill, we made it Senate-confirmable.
- That's the first I've heard...
- They added it in conference.
- Well, we'll find something.
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
Can't be Museum Studies.
God forbid the Senate falls out of the mix on that.
I've made a lot of enemies on the Hill.
You don't owe me.
We asked you to fight a losing...
Yes, we owe you.
- This is when the president calls a play...
- I called the play.
I called it.
Raising the gas tax?
It was a loser, and I pushed to have you introduce it anyway.
That doesn't make any difference.
- Look, look, let's just...
- I came out for a gas tax because someone from Michigan had to.
Gas prices are too low.
It's why the air's polluted.
It's why no one wants alternative fuels.
And clearly that argument took the nation by storm.
In my religion, the whole symbol of the religion ended in crucifixion and condemnation.
That wasn't a measure of the experience.
It's just the way it ended.
Yeah, but I'm the Romans.
It's in the living.
It's in the campaigning that you make your mark.
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
You have until the end of the day on those tickets, by the way.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
- And congratulations.
- Okay.
- Do you know if the president's still in?
- He is.
Thanks.
- Mr. President, can you see Sam?
- Sure.
- Good evening, sir.
- You're the nominee.
There's no nominee.
Everyone's on the ballot.
- Is there another Democrat?
- No.
You're the nominee.
- Yeah.
- And I know how you feel.
- You like Scott Holcomb?
- I don't know him well.
He's terrific.
There's a good guy out there named Will Bailey if he should come across your radar.
You gonna campaign on prescription drugs?
Our drug bill, yes, sir.
And our Medicare reforms and the Bartlet Energy Plan.
- Sam?
- Yes, sir?
It's okay to run away from me when you need to.
I would never, Mr. President.
I simply would never do that.
- That's not how I get votes.
- I appreciate that but that's not what I'm talking about.
You disagreed with me on Medicare, I remember the meeting right here and then you wrote a five-page memo.
Run towards yourself.
I'm wrong about that.
Walk.
- You're not used to your surroundings.
- Yes, sir.
If you lose, you lose, but if you waste this, I'll just kill you, Sam.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Good evening, Mr. President.
- Hey.
- Thank-you notes?
- Yeah.
I'm going to bed.
You don't really like making thank-you calls, do you?
Spill it.
How many precinct captains did you line up for Hoynes?
- I didn't line up...
- Forty-seven.
Charlie showed me the call sheets.
I said thanks on behalf of the ticket.
I can't help it if...
Yeah.
They'll think what they want.
They think you're freezing the race for Hoynes.
I'm freezing it for us.
We just won four more years.
- This is not time for a free-for-all.
- This shouldn't be what you do anymore.
- Do I call them all back?
- We'll take care of it.
All right.
Tehran's gonna accelerate medium-range missile tests by two weeks.
We'll gather the NSC principals in the morning.
All right.
Anything else?
Salman Afkham was wheeled into surgery 15 minutes ago.
Mohebi's day just started.
Well, I suppose there are worse ways for ours to end.
Yeah, that's right.
Previously on The West Wing:
Andy's pregnant.
It's twins and, of course, I'm the father.
You know I'm gonna get sued.
- I work for Senator Hoynes.
- Yeah.
I wonder if I'd listened to you two years ago, would I be president right now?
- You did it for the widow?
- And for a guy named Will Bailey who ran the campaign and worked his ass off.
You might be asked tomorrow if you're endorsing me.
- Am I?
Toby, is the president endorsing Sam?
We think you should run.
- What do you think?
- I think you should win.
How do you interpret the margin of victory?
The votes have been counted and the people have spoken and it's clear that their will is for me to do and have anything I want.
Mr. President, Arnold White, Associated Press what's the first legislative priority?
- There's a new guy from AP?
- Yeah, what's your priority?
The president of Turkmenistan just officially extended the date of adolescence to 25.
So things like that.
I think he also renamed the month of January after himself.
That's greedy.
Real power is knowing when to leave something on the table.
- Sir, what legislative...?
- Patients' Bill of Rights, drugs keeping the economy growing, find a surplus again keep the surplus growing, use the surplus to build schools worthy of defending the military that Fitz and Hutchinson are gonna build to fight urban wars, then pay the teachers.
I asked for a legislative priority, you gave me nine.
It's a big country, Arnold.
Debbie, where the hell are you?
And where are my...?
You left your glasses in the mansion and the Ipswich clams in Chesapeake Bay can hear you bellowing right now.
Ipswich clams don't come from Chesapeake Bay.
They come from Ipswich.
- Not anymore.
- Have her beheaded for my birthday.
They'll ask you how you feel about housing starts going down.
I don't care as long as I'm keeping this one.
- GDP growth is strong.
- You bet your ass it is which, by the way, I can pad anytime I want now.
The voters have spoken.
Lowest inflation in 20 years.
Housing starts are cyclical, which is the thing.
What do you got?
- Flooding in Missouri.
- FEMA's on the ground?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I've got the Swiss ambassador in my office.
I don't know why.
You and I enjoy your funny jokes, but Idaho, not so much.
- Take it easy in there?
- I know my people.
Sometimes it's hard to believe I'm one of them.
Good luck.
Thank you.
- Ambassador Von Rutte.
- Okay.
- Thank you for seeing me.
- What's going on?
A communication from Tehran.
You understand our mission's the only one.
The president appreciates it.
The ayatollah's son has a congenital heart condition Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
His best chance is a simultaneous heart and lung transplant.
- They asked Japan?
- Procedures differ, they want yours.
- What's wrong with Japan's?
- Well, I don't know how to...
No one...
- It hasn't been successful?
- No.
Okay, then ours is better.
Anybody else do this?
- Just the U.S. and Japan.
- No, Japan doesn't do it yet.
Coming close doesn't matter on this, it's not the Gemini missions.
I'm gonna talk to the president, but if it means bumping an American off...
Iran has a donor.
- A donor or a dissenter?
- This is from Doctors Without Borders.
It wasn't from the ayatollah?
They were approached by the ayatollah's brother-in-law.
This is coming through you, through an NGO, through the brother-in-law.
Guy will put his son's life in the infidels' hands, but he'll keep his distance?
The hard-liners control the Majlis.
Things are difficult for him with the Shehab missile tests.
He cannot have a problem with his right flank.
Yeah, much better we should have a problem with ours.
- I'll talk to him.
- The president?
Don 't get me wrong, Mark, I think January's a good month.
Yeah, the president, generalissimo, whatever he comes back as.
- Messages.
- Goodwin at AP.
- What else?
- Judy Vanderbass wife of our ambassador to Vietnam, you've been to her house.
Yeah, I'm sure I ate a springer spaniel.
Why is AP on my phone sheet?
Triplehorn told him you're the reason there's no deal on prescription drugs.
- I'm the reason?
-"With Lyman negotiating..." Yeah.
- I feel ill-will toward the minority leader.
- I've had it up to here with the Welsh.
I'm not kidding.
He was campaigning with us a half-hour ago.
School's back.
Go see him.
Let's call that Plan A. Plan B is you see him.
- Karen Kroft.
- And National Parks screw me up again.
Yeah.
I'm gonna head to the leader's office.
Get me the first free minute he has.
And Judy Vanderbass?
Let's do this.
Find out what her problem is solve it, and then do something else.
- You're the reason there are term limits.
- Yeah?
You're the reason...
Nothing.
Nothing's happening.
Nothing's there.
- You seem fine.
- I am.
- You really seem fine.
- I really am.
Good.
The view from the canvas, it's educational, you know.
Yeah, I've had extensive education.
What was the final margin?
One hundred and twenty-seven votes.
- A hundred and twenty-seven.
- That's about 12 lawn signs.
- Wasn't your last election also...?
- Eighty-two votes.
The president says all you need is one, the rest is for ego.
- How many did the president win by?
- About three and a half million.
- Yeah.
- He's got a pretty healthy ego, though.
I don't know, maybe the job wasn't for me.
I like land.
I like dirt.
I like things that live on land and dirt.
I like hotels.
I like a good concierge.
Could you be a little more sympathetic?
I'm a loser.
Not a big one.
Okay.
The president thinks there's a place for you.
That's nice of you guys.
It really is.
But I was thinking about...
I was thinking about maybe trying for a job with the National Park Service.
- We were thinking the same thing.
- A job with the National Park Service?
As what?
The director of the National Park Service.
- Are you kidding me?
- No.
- You're not kidding?
- No.
- Is this just because...?
- Do you want it?
Yes.
Yes.
Then get yourself a big hat, and Leo's gonna call you in a couple hours.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy are the first three for tea.
- All's well that ends well.
- Karen Kroft.
National Parks chairman.
- Nice.
- She's very happy.
Andy's about to get sued for election fraud.
- Andy was trying to get sued for fraud.
- Really?
Yeah.
She's a pistol.
Everyone, please take your seats.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy are the first three for tea with the president at 3 p.m. in the Map Room.
Susan, Karnow and Duffy.
Next week it's Mark, Leslie and Eric.
- Who's running Sam's campaign?
- Sam's putting his team together.
I'm referring those questions to the campaign's press office.
John, Katie.
Will the president attend...?
Mr. Seaborn, how does it feel to have the nomination?
There is no nomination, there is a primary and if someone gets 50 percent of the vote, there is no general.
There are no other Democrats running.
They're endorsing you.
- Wouldn't you say you're the nominee?
- I suppose.
- Have you staffed the key positions yet?
- I'm gonna let Will Bailey answer.
Campaign manager is Scott Holcomb.
Finance director is Betsy Wadkins.
Communications director is Mark Stearns.
Excuse me for a second.
Can I talk to you?
Political director is Tom Baker.
The volunteer coordinator is Paula Montgomery.
- Over here, please.
- Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Scott's campaign manager?
What's your title?
- Citizen Bailey.
- I'm not kidding.
- I'm the chancellor of Germany.
- Will...
- What the hell's going on?
- Your team's in the field.
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, Will.
You and I had this conversation for two hours.
What are you doing?
- I don't think you should go.
- You made that clear.
- I'm doing this now.
- Listen, there are too many chiefs here.
- I'll get rid of some.
- No, you want them.
Scott Holcomb and Betsy, these guys are the best.
We just went from 435 House races to one.
You get the all-star team.
He doesn't want the best, he wants you.
Yes, but the Republicans are starting their starters, so you gotta match up.
We match up fine.
You got me into this.
Well, you got you into this but I owe you the best chance to win.
I owe that to Mr. Wilde.
Tell him that's ridiculous.
I took the race to show the DNC that no district should be ignored.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll stick around for a week and help and then I'm gonna take a vacation.
- Where?
- I don't know.
France, Italy, Wales.
Maybe EPCOT.
All right.
I've gotta head to Washington.
I'll see you day after tomorrow.
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you.
- Have a good flight, Sam.
- Thank you.
- EPCOT?
- I was kidding.
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.
- Sir?
- Yeah.
It's called penmanship, Watson.
Something your generation wouldn't know about because of the computers.
- How many of these things am I doing?
- Sixty.
- How many have I done?
- Three.
- Three?
- Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.
- Your system's slowing me down.
- I don't have a system.
- You're kidding?
- You ready?
Hey, can't we have color codings and stickers, priority lists?
- Can I get a little bureaucracy going?
- What are you doing?
I'm doing basically what the president does.
Ask people for things and then thank them for things.
Let's go.
Take the calls to the mansion.
I'll meet you there after this.
We had a couple of cats when the kids were kids named Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilburforce or something, I can't remember.
You know, I've never really liked human names for animals.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, I can't believe my kids didn't think to ask you what to name the cats.
But they used to bring mice into the house and show them to me.
This is how I'm starting to feel about the Swiss.
Yeah.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
Tell me about the boy.
He and a guardian have crossed into Kandahar.
A UN plane is on the ground.
It's gonna leave at 11:45 Zulu if you say okay.
- Eleven forty-five?
- Yes, sir.
- That's 11 minutes from now.
- Yes, sir.
This meeting's premature.
- We should wait 10 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
This meeting doesn't go in the Sit Room anymore, okay?
I don't know why it's here.
This isn't a military operation.
- It's a secure room.
- My office is a secure room too, isn't it?
Please, somebody tell me it is, or I gotta go pack some stuff.
- You see my point?
- What about the organs?
- The organs are in Zurich.
- I'm sorry, that sounded funny to me.
I'm the kid in bio who laughed all the time.
- Then on to Paris on Swiss Air.
- Coach?
- I don't...
- Then New York?
- Yes, sir.
- The heart and lungs get here first.
They can last about 40 hours, the flight from Tehran's 15.
What's left is to line up a doctor and get the funding.
- Go around the room.
- If it leaks, you got clerics.
It sends a message to the reformists.
At a time when they're breaking 70 percent in local elections.
If you're looking for ways to temper support to the Shiites, I don't...
- A benevolent power must...
- This isn't the time.
Don't forget the Shehab program and the transport corridors along the Silk Route.
How old is he?
- I'm sorry?
- How old is he?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.
The Shiites, Manny that's what you want me to take back to my thoracic surgeon wife?
Get this boy in preop.
Tell the Swiss to stop standing in the door with a mouse in their mouth.
- If they're coming in, come in.
- You won't regret it, sir.
It won't leak.
No, because we're in a secure room, except for the ayatollah's staff a Swiss Air pilot and 400 other people.
- Laney, is this gonna leak?
- Well...
I feel better already.
Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilburforce.
There's nothing wrong with my memory.
Though those are stupid names.
There's something wrong with my kids.
Come on, Josh.
The Senate's out of session you ought to think about putting a Ping-Pong table out here.
- I don't think that would be a good idea.
- Quick rounds between motions...
- Now just because the Senate's not...
- I'm kidding.
- You'd be surprised what people think.
- Read the AP wire.
- You know what that's about.
- Yeah, you're running for president.
We hold elections in this country, not coronations.
- I'm not saying any different.
- Then why is every...?
I must've...
I've talked to two dozen of your precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
- Nearly every one of them's locked up.
- They're locked...
You're recruiting precinct captains 48 months before the next election?
John Hoynes is using the White House to lock up the Democratic primaries.
If you're saying there's a nomination fight...
Hoynes doesn't inherit this.
I'm not gonna see the party dragged to the middle.
Nothing's being dragged anywhere.
You were with us just days ago.
- This is about the future of the party.
- Yeah, how about we enjoy the present?
You agree with Hoynes on guns?
On trade?
On school choice?
Look, Hoynes is...
Did I fall asleep for three and a half years?
You think a minority leader's irrelevant?
You think I can't affect the president's agenda?
- I know you can.
- I'd like you to be for me, Josh.
Not because you're good at what you do, because of your beliefs.
Okay, I'm not for anyone.
I barely unpacked from the last campaign.
Well, Hoynes is gonna have to release those precinct captains or we're...
It keeps getting earlier, doesn't it?
Yes.
And they're asking for you in the HHS meeting, and the 5: 15's new.
- The CEA?
- Ways to fight a possible recession.
- What did we say?
-"Don't say 'recession' in this building."
- You just did it again!
- What do I call the meeting?
The robust economy meeting.
- Josh is patching it up with Triplehorn.
- Good.
- And Karen Kroft wants National Parks.
- She can't have it.
- What are you talking about?
- She can't.
- We talked about it.
- The president signed the Parks Bill.
- The job just became Senate-confirmable.
- Yeah, that was for next fiscal year.
It turns out it's retroactive.
I just saw the final language.
Thanks.
- Whose idea...?
How did we miss this?
- There are 90 amendments in the bill.
- Maybe we put her up anyway.
- No.
- We asked her to do it.
- She led the charge for a higher gas tax.
- We asked her to do it.
- The Senate isn't gonna understand.
Plus, the minority leader is already pissed at us.
Okay, thanks.
Ginger.
Don't.
I need a list of sub-cabinet vacancies that aren't Senate-confirmable.
- Mine's not.
- A little less sub-cabinet than that one.
You wanna crash a space probe into Neptune, that's fine with me.
I think we've crashed into most of the other planets, but 2.5 billion, okay?
- Yes, sir.
- If we fail, I wanna do it on budget.
Thank you, Mr. President.
More thank-you notes?
Why don't you tell Debbie we're gonna do some calls.
- Calls?
- Yes, calls.
Calls.
Mr. Sarcasm with your dry"calls."
I was this close to renaming one of the oceans after you, but no way.
Maybe, maybe, one of the species of fish.
Like trout.
Trout is now Charlie.
Went to the lake, pulled out a Charlie for dinner.
Look at the size of that Charlie you've got on your wall.
Thank you, sir.
- What do you got?
- Yeah, we've got a situation.
- Yeah?
- Reuters has the ayatollah's son just left Afghanistan on a C-130.
Is he coming here for a heart transplant?
- Heart and lung.
- I'm assuming we knew about this.
- Knew about it?
We did it.
- The ayatollah's issued a statement.
- What kind?
- Bitterly denouncing it, sir.
"Our nation can take care of its own.
Interference from the West is an affront to Islam."
What's the room saying?
They think we're hiding Leo's meeting with the Swiss.
- So you know, the press coffee...
- Can't do it now.
Yes.
You're right.
- I need you to step out just a moment.
- Sure.
Thank you.
- We're not gonna not do it.
- I'm with you.
Hi.
Before you say anything, here's my idea.
The kid needs lungs and a heart.
Let's use the ayatollah's.
- What are you smiling at?
- I'm sorry, it's...
I'm sorry, sir.
It's the little note Margaret just passed me.
"The Iranians, they've taken to the streets." Perfect.
- That goes to the Margaret Museum.
- Please don't forget all politics are local.
- Bite me.
- He's gotta say something to...
He's got to say something to his hard-liners.
He didn't wanna try"My son is dying, and these guys maybe can fix him.
And maybe if our citizens didn't spend so much energy denouncing infidels they'd have time to build a damn medical school!"
The Swiss talked to the NGO, who talked to the brother-in-law who speaks for the ayatollah.
Just tell me that they weren't using cellular technology because I don't care what anybody says, it doesn't work yet.
Think about linking it to the missile tests.
- What do you mean?
- Send a communiqué through the Swiss.
The ayatollah's gotta honor Bahrain.
Stop all tests of the Shehab-3.
He's gonna say no.
That's when you tell him you're gonna turn the plane around.
- No.
- I said, you threaten...
No.
Come on.
That's a 15-year-old non-combatant on his way to a hospital.
Pretend that plane's got a big red cross on it.
- They perfect medium-range missiles.
- I understand.
- What's that do for hearts and lungs?
- Send a communiqué.
There's a Bahrain agreement that says...
Send it.
Don't even come close.
I don't even want a scent of linkage to...
A big damn red cross right on that plane.
Thanks for your help.
I'll let you know.
- I got this problem to put in perspective.
- What's the problem?
Triplehorn thinks I'm a secret operative for Hoynes.
- Are you?
- I don't believe I am.
- This ought to help.
- What?
- Vanderbass didn't invite you to dinner.
- Thank merciful God.
Turns out Trish Rackley, wife of your protégé she had a problem on the CODEL to Southeast Asia.
The rice?
No, really, the whole continent loves the stereotype.
- They eat a lot of rice, Donna.
- Mrs. Rackley borrowed $ 1500 from Judy Vanderbass to buy a teak bed for 2000, which is a good price.
- And?
- Mrs. Rackley's check bounced.
- Making it a great price.
- The Rackleys are stiffing her, Josh.
- What do you mean,"Josh"?
- You put him on the delegation.
I told State to look after him.
I didn't want him in trouble.
Phil Rackley's office won't return her calls.
Well, see if they'll return yours.
- Toby, Triplehorn's on fire.
- He needs to build a case against...
Hoynes is lining up precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
This is 10 minutes after the polls close in California.
And Winnick just called.
It's probably the same thing.
Half the Senate's gonna run.
If it looks like we're giving Hoynes...
Yeah.
You gotta back him off.
Okay, devil's advocate.
- Isn't Hoynes entitled?
- Yeah, but not yet.
It's just we got him on the ticket by convincing him it wasn't his turn.
We kept him out, because it wasn't his turn, and now...
There aren't any turns.
So these two people rob a Starbucks near Seattle.
Half an hour they serve coffee to make more money.
- Know when they make their getaway?
- When business slows down.
Beat that?
- When's Josh meeting with Hoynes?
- Soon.
What do you need?
Alternate federal co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission.
- What about it?
- It's Senate-confirmable.
- Really?
- So is commissioner of Hopi Relocation.
Let me tell you something about this job, you need a deep bench.
Inspector general of the Railroad Retirement Board director of the Institute of Museum Studies...
- My job's not.
- Ginger beat you to that joke.
- Karen lost her seat because of us.
- What do you want me to do?
Get used to the fact that we won in a landslide.
We can fight on this.
Ernest went down for the gun ban, Janice for taxes...
This is different.
We asked her to introduce the bill.
She knew that.
It's called a trial balloon.
Yeah, but it's also called a recorded vote.
She did that kind of thing for us.
She was our gal on the back bench.
She poured lighter fluid on the Republican leadership.
They're not gonna confirm her.
They're gonna make us look bad doing it.
And we still got half a new cabinet to confirm.
- They're starting.
- Thanks.
The Hopi Relocation guy?
Yeah.
Laney says the plane's still six hours out.
With a headwind that could buy us another hour.
The problem is...
- We don't have a doctor.
- What are you talking about?
There are only three who can do this.
Jorrey's in the middle of a heart valve replacement, Weingarten...
- Where's he?
- Rappelling the north face of K2.
- Rappelling up or rappelling down?
- It's in Pakistan.
What does it matter?
- It's not in Pakistan, you only think it is.
- Okay.
If I need a life-saving procedure, make sure the surgeon's suffering from massive oxygen deprivation.
- Who's the third?
- Dr. Ehsan Mohebi at Smith-Lansing.
- Oh, don't tell me.
- Yeah.
He fled Iran in '80 after fundamentalists tortured and killed his father.
The one guy who could save his son, and he tortured his father.
- That's just bad staff work.
Charlie!
- Are we sure about Japan?
One of these days they're gonna find the fairway.
Would you pull the first lady out of whatever she's in right now.
- She's with the Women's Caucus.
- Put on a helmet and get in there.
Make sure Mohebi's sitting by a phone.
He takes an elevator, we know the number.
- That's it.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
The National Committee's got a list of conventions where we asked the vice president to take our slot.
And the DPC sent me this list of his budget roll-outs and it's for last year.
I need all four.
Okay.
- What?
- The deadbeat Rackleys.
- I can't...
- Come on!
You called them deadbeats.
- For the sake of humor.
- Good one, Gracie.
- Who hasn't bounced a check?
- Me.
Yes, Mr. I-Balance-My-Checkbook-Every- Month-and-Don't-Ever-Bounce-Checks.
Everything you just said was a good thing and by saying it like Ethel Mertz...
Do you know what a congressman makes?
A buck and a half, 161,200 for the leadership.
To maintain two residences, fly your kids back and forth...
I know you like to hit with me, but go sit in the back of class because you just suggested that making only 150,000 a year was reasonable justification for committing a felony which is what it is, Lulu.
- What the hell is Lulu?
- It's To Sir With Love.
Thank you.
- I just need the lists.
- I have the lists.
That's why I'm asking you for them.
- Do you want them?
- Yes.
- We're talking about the lists?
- And you have them, and I want them.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, Terry.
- Bobby, sir.
- Yeah.
You pulled me out of the Women's Caucus.
No need to thank me.
Whatever happened to Mrs. Wilburforce?
She moved to Miami and took up massage.
- Really?
- Last I heard.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You asked me.
- Wasn't Mrs. Wilburforce our cat?
- She was our housekeeper.
Really?
All right, Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
It's a cyanotic heart condition.
There's something called ventricular septal defect...
The ayatollah's son has it.
Am I dreaming, or are you talking to me about foreign policy?
Worried the sky's gonna fall?
No, but I'm concerned about spousal abuse.
What's the problem?
There's a problem with State...?
- The only doctor available won't do it.
- He's Jewish?
- Persian.
- He doesn't have a choice.
- Abbey...
- He doesn't.
Doctors aren't instruments of state and aren't allowed to choose patients.
- I can't order him to do it.
- Yes, you can.
Through the power vested in me by you?
Samuel Mudd set Booth's leg after he shot Lincoln.
Doctors are liable if they don't treat the patient.
This is why we don't talk about foreign policy which we do, and you don't think we do it enough.
- Why?
- Because Samuel Mudd was tried and convicted of treason for that.
- So?
- What"so"?
So that's the way it goes, you set the leg.
- The patient right in front of them?
- Yes.
All right, go back to the sewing thing.
It's the Women's...
Never mind.
I couldn't tell you the last time I took a week away.
- You ought to take a vacation yourself.
- Yeah, I don't get Hawaii.
Great weather, great beaches, universal health care.
I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
You remember Neil Spencer, the rep from Honolulu who helped on the ag bill?
Spent all his time tanning on the Capitol balcony.
- If he went home without a tan...
- They'd know he'd gone Washington.
- We gotta talk politics.
- I'd like to.
I'm glad we had that little talk on Air Force Two.
From time to time...
We need you to stop shopping for precinct captains.
- Excuse me?
- We're days after an election.
- It's too early...
- Is that what this is about?
Triplehorn alone can tie us in knots.
Good for Triplehorn.
I've got an obligation to myself.
You've got a constitutional obligation.
Last time I checked, my constitutional obligation was to have a pulse.
We need these two years.
- It's our last chance to govern, John.
- Mr. Vice President.
- There are gonna be lots of ways...
- No zealot like a convert, Josh.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you'd have been great at Leo's job.
Half this town's gonna be running.
I do the president's politics.
He can't govern if I'm seen as...
Being for me?
I don't think there's much risk of that.
You were wrong.
I never went to Hawaii.
- What?
- We skipped Hawaii.
We went rafting on the Flathead River instead.
Don't touch that.
Or that.
"The boy's on the plane.
He's experiencing pulmonary hypertension."
That's elevated pressure in the lungs, I think.
That could lead to what?
- Doctor, that could lead to what?
- I'm sorry...
That could lead to what?
- Heart failure.
- That's what it says.
Follow me.
His right ventricular pressure has risen to 102 millimeters mercury.
Low-oxygen blood's beginning to bypass the lungs.
That's right.
He has something called"in situ thrombi."
His arteries have lost their anticoagulant properties, and I resent this.
Doctor Mohebi, I don't care.
Why aren't you scrubbing up?
People are taken from their homes in the dead of night and jailed and tortured for months.
- I know.
- Public executions...
- Doctor...
- Political opponents dragged outside...
- I know this.
Don't you think I know?
- I won't aid the enemy.
I'll let you know who the enemy is.
That's my job.
It's not a 15-year-old boy.
How do I know the organs were donated voluntarily?
- Doctors Without Borders.
- You don't know these people.
I do know these people.
You're crazy if you don't think I do.
I don't need to be told who the enemy is.
- Doctor...
- It's not your family that's still there.
My family's there.
- If the procedure isn't successful...
- Nothing will happen to them.
- Sir...
- Nothing will happen to them.
Who's making that guarantee?
Well, the Swiss, I guess.
Look, I'll use every power of the office to protect you and your family.
But can I just say that this is how things change for the better.
A world-class surgeon or a school teacher in Afjah who questions the ayatollah's divine power.
Do me a favor, go to Smith-Lansing and look at the kid because I think when you do, you're gonna scrub up.
If you don't, I respect that, and the man made his own bed.
Okay?
Yeah.
What was your father's name?
- Raji.
- What'd he teach?
- Science.
- Thank you.
Get him to Baltimore.
- You think his cell phone?
- Not white-water rafting.
And staff can't make those calls.
They're top-tier Iowa people and New Hampshire.
Forty, 50 calls from the Flathead River?
That really doesn't seem possible.
- Unless...
- That's what I'm saying.
All right, I'll take it.
C.E.Q.
- What do I tell Triplehorn?
- Tell him it's done.
- You're sure?
- Thank you, no, I...
They're playing the Eagles.
We're talking 50-yard line.
Toby?
You can't have the job.
Okay.
The Parks Bill, we made it Senate-confirmable.
- That's the first I've heard...
- They added it in conference.
- Well, we'll find something.
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
Can't be Museum Studies.
God forbid the Senate falls out of the mix on that.
I've made a lot of enemies on the Hill.
You don't owe me.
We asked you to fight a losing...
Yes, we owe you.
- This is when the president calls a play...
- I called the play.
I called it.
Raising the gas tax?
It was a loser, and I pushed to have you introduce it anyway.
That doesn't make any difference.
- Look, look, let's just...
- I came out for a gas tax because someone from Michigan had to.
Gas prices are too low.
It's why the air's polluted.
It's why no one wants alternative fuels.
And clearly that argument took the nation by storm.
In my religion, the whole symbol of the religion ended in crucifixion and condemnation.
That wasn't a measure of the experience.
It's just the way it ended.
Yeah, but I'm the Romans.
It's in the living.
It's in the campaigning that you make your mark.
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
You have until the end of the day on those tickets, by the way.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
- And congratulations.
- Okay.
- Do you know if the president's still in?
- He is.
Thanks.
- Mr. President, can you see Sam?
- Sure.
- Good evening, sir.
- You're the nominee.
There's no nominee.
Everyone's on the ballot.
- Is there another Democrat?
- No.
You're the nominee.
- Yeah.
- And I know how you feel.
- You like Scott Holcomb?
- I don't know him well.
He's terrific.
There's a good guy out there named Will Bailey if he should come across your radar.
You gonna campaign on prescription drugs?
Our drug bill, yes, sir.
And our Medicare reforms and the Bartlet Energy Plan.
- Sam?
- Yes, sir?
It's okay to run away from me when you need to.
I would never, Mr. President.
I simply would never do that.
- That's not how I get votes.
- I appreciate that but that's not what I'm talking about.
You disagreed with me on Medicare, I remember the meeting right here and then you wrote a five-page memo.
Run towards yourself.
I'm wrong about that.
Walk.
- You're not used to your surroundings.
- Yes, sir.
If you lose, you lose, but if you waste this, I'll just kill you, Sam.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Good evening, Mr. President.
- Hey.
- Thank-you notes?
- Yeah.
I'm going to bed.
You don't really like making thank-you calls, do you?
Spill it.
How many precinct captains did you line up for Hoynes?
- I didn't line up...
- Forty-seven.
Charlie showed me the call sheets.
I said thanks on behalf of the ticket.
I can't help it if...
Yeah.
They'll think what they want.
They think you're freezing the race for Hoynes.
I'm freezing it for us.
We just won four more years.
- This is not time for a free-for-all.
- This shouldn't be what you do anymore.
- Do I call them all back?
- We'll take care of it.
All right.
Tehran's gonna accelerate medium-range missile tests by two weeks.
We'll gather the NSC principals in the morning.
All right.
Anything else?
Salman Afkham was wheeled into surgery 15 minutes ago.
Mohebi's day just started.
Well, I suppose there are worse ways for ours to end.
Yeah, that's right.
Previously on The West Wing:
- It's over.
- You'll be back.
Let's go, 10 bucks.
Ten bucks for you.
It was the president's idea.
Bet us you couldn't stay quiet if he gave a bad answer.
Horton Wilde in Orange County is in the hospital.
His 4th heart attack.
Who knows when he'll resume a campaign.
- He's dead.
- President wins the debate tomorrow you marry me again.
- Will Bailey, come inside?
- The campaign's embarrassing to us.
- I'm not embarrassed by it.
If you can't find a Democrat, tell Kay I'll do it.
Andy's pregnant, with twins.
Thank you.
- You're Josh Lyman, aren't you?
- Yeah.
I've seen your picture a lot.
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
Bartlet's on the ballot for the Democratic Party and for the Statehood Party.
It's okay that I voted for him in both columns, right?
No, you can't vote for him in two columns.
I already did.
Your ballot's gonna be invalidated.
- What for?
- You're allowed to vote once.
He's on the ballot twice.
He's on it more.
He's on it as the Liberal Party nominee...
- I'm saying, I'm for Statehood.
Me too, and yours is a vote we didn't get.
I'm so sorry to interrupt did you say you're supposed to vote for the president in both columns?
No.
No.
You can vote for the president in whatever column you want but you can only vote once.
- He's right.
- Yes...
I'm...
Yes.
- And I'll tell you a secret for a shortcut.
If you just, say, vote for one Democrat and leave the rest of the boxes blank, then you voted for all the Democrats.
Yes.
No.
It doesn't...
You can't vote for a party, you have to vote for a person.
- No, I think you're wrong.
- I'm not.
I left all but one box blank.
Well, then, you voted for none but one candidate.
Nuts.
Did you vote for the president?
Was the president the one?
- Who remembers?
- It was a minute and a half ago.
- Don't be rude.
- I'm sorry.
Thank you for voting.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, what?
Yes.
Yes, hello.
- You're who I think you are, right?
- I can be anybody you want.
- That's funny.
- Thank you.
I saw you getting run over by those people.
Just part of the job, ma'am.
I guess you hear some pretty silly questions.
Well, I'm just worried because they all tried to vote for Bartlet.
If this keeps up we're headed toward the biggest electoral upset in history.
Nobody's gonna figure out why.
Right.
It's the same thing with my parents.
I tell them, rank the candidates in order of preference.
Right.
No.
Mr. Lyman, voted for your boy in all three boxes.
No, listen to me, your ballot is invalid.
So is yours.
Punch the box next to the candidate you prefer once.
Nothing else.
- I'm sorry, one more thing?
- Yes?
I have a message from Toby Ziegler.
- What?
- I have a message from Toby Ziegler.
You know Toby?
He says:
"Ten dollars."
I see.
You guys are a little troupe a little acting troupe, with a U.
- Yes, sir, we are.
- Can I give you a card?
- No.
Mr. Ziegler said you were edgy on election days so to show there are no hard feelings how about I go there and vote for the president, now.
As a matter of fact, that'd be nice.
No problem.
Do you happen to know if I need to be I don't know, pre-registered or something?
Yes!
The teachers have 500 red and blue "Bartlet-Hoynes" banners.
- That plus 600 from Building Trades.
- No.
- I'm sorry?
- No.
- Why?
- The partisanship's over.
We elected a president.
This is for everybody.
No banners tonight, American flags...
But use the Seal, I'll put Senate and House Leadership up there.
- No balloons, no confetti.
- Why?
- It's not a party.
- It is a party.
- But we won.
We don't have to pander.
- Don't say that.
On your birthday, don't we pander?
- Not as much as I'd like.
- Not kidding.
- What are you babbling about?
- We haven't won.
- The speech is done.
- Two speeches.
- What's the second?
- One if he wins one if he doesn't.
- You wrote a concession?
Of course I wrote a concession.
You wanna tempt the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing?
- No.
- Then go outside, turn around and spit.
What's the matter with you?
- It's like 25 degrees outside.
- Go.
- Hello.
- Mr. Lyman.
I see your picture in the magazine.
Tell me, if I swallow my ballot, does it...?
- Election Day humor, great.
- He wrote a concession speech.
Of course he wrote it.
Why wouldn't he?
What possible reason would he have for not writing a concession speech?
- The wrath from high atop the thing?
- He upped and said we were gonna...
No, go outside, turn around three times and curse.
- Spit.
- Spit and curse.
- Do everything.
Go.
- Go!
- Go!
- Go!
These things have a half-life.
You can't...
- We're meeting again when?
- First round of exits at 11.
Eleven o'clock unless there's a reason earlier.
- Can I have you two seconds?
- Yeah.
- What do you need?
- Hang on.
- There's trouble?
- A little bit.
- For the president?
- For you.
I know better than to stick my face in your personal life.
Except, you know, for sport.
- What happened?
- Roll Call's got it from the Office of Congress's attending physician that Andy's pregnant.
When did they start doing more than flu vaccinations?
They need updated records.
Roll Call doesn't need updated records, though.
They're gonna connect the dots.
It's gonna be bad for her and bad for you.
- You mean bad for us.
- I can handle the us.
- What's her plan?
- I don't know.
- Toby.
- I don't know.
We haven't talked.
- She's gotta be proactive.
- Yeah.
It'd be nice if we could announce a wedding.
- I'm working on that, thanks.
- You'll talk to her?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- Did you...?
- Yes, I turned, I cursed, I spat, it froze.
- You can't be too careful.
- I think you can.
Sam, you got Will Bailey calling from California.
"Won't you come home, Will Bailey?
Won't you come home?"
Sancho, how you doing?
-I'm Sancho?
- Yeah.
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes, grasshopper.
- How much do you know on exit polls?
- What's to know?
You stand 100 yards away and say"Who'd you vote for?"
You can't afford exit polls.
I've got volunteers out there.
- And?
- Something weird's going on.
- What?
- We're winning.
- What do you mean?
- We're down one in Spyglass Hill... ...even in Emerald Bay and up three in El Toro Station.
- Can I give you free advice?
- Yeah.
It's not advice so much as I'm saying this:
Democrats vote early.
Okay?
And diehards vote early.
You want me to call in every couple of hours?
- Every hour.
- Okay.
Bonnie Democrats vote early, right?
- Yeah.
Ginger?
Democrats and diehards vote early, right?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Mrs. Bartlet, can you tell us who you voted for?
- Nobody, I was just fixing my makeup.
- How are you spending the day?
Filling out Chicago ballots, just pitching in.
He's gonna be flying around thanking supporters.
- Is there any suspense at all today?
- Well, there are about 14 competitive Senate races, about 46 House races right here in New Hampshire there's a 600-million-dollar bond issue plus, no one's elected my husband president yet.
Mr. President, polls show a dogfight here in New Hampshire.
How would you feel if you won the election, but lost your home state?
Better than if I won my home state, but lost my home country.
But the only poll that matters closes in 17 hours.
- Did you vote for the bond issue?
- Title 63, Chapter 659, Section 43 of New Hampshire Election Code says:
"Electioneering is prohibited within a corridor 10 feet wide extending a distance from the entrance door as determined by the moderator where the election is being held."
If anyone knows what that means.
Yeah, I voted for the bond issue.
It'll improve public education without a tax abatement.
- Mr. President.
Mr. President, do you have anything to say to Governor Ritchie today?
Well, one way or another, I imagine we'll be talking tonight.
I gotta get back.
You can hockle Abbey for a while, she's taking the next plane.
Thank you, Mr. President.
- These are for your signature.
- Yeah.
- Could you score me a couple of aspirin?
- Yes, sir.
- Got a headache?
- I'm fine.
- Should I ask the doctors to...?
- It's just a headache.
- Just me and you today, okay?
I'm fine.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll sign these in the car.
- Yes, sir.
Come on.
Okay, this can wait.
Let's go.
Nothing's happening right now.
By the end of the night, 100 million votes will be cast.
Polls have been open in the East for six and a half hours.
You know how many votes have been cast?
One percent.
Everybody votes after work.
Not me, I vote first thing.
The VNS exit polls are down in Michigan for a little while.
And it's raining in Oregon.
This is like the ionization blackout period.
Pumpkin Patch, anything I can do to get you to the movies for eight hours?
- Senior Staff.
- Yeah.
- But can you do me a favor?
- What do you need?
This is a photocopy of my absentee ballot.
I was hoping the president could sign it and I'd have it framed.
- Yeah.
You know the president's the first winner I voted for?
- Is this a joke?
- It's not hard to believe...
- No, I mean this.
- What are you talking about?
Toby already did the thing this morning with the invalid ballots.
- My ballot's invalid?
- This isn't a joke?
- It's invalid?
- You voted for Ritchie.
- Where?
- Here.
Oh, my God.
Your picking-the-winner streak is probably over.
No, no, no.
It's an optical scan ballot.
I drew a line through the Democratic ticket.
Almost.
You drew a line through the Republican ticket.
You didn't ticket-split.
You voted for every Republican in Wisconsin.
Check.
You may have voted for McCarthy.
- I'm gonna rectify this.
- How?
I don't know, but it'll be counted.
- It will.
- I don't want it counted.
- I'm going, you still want...?
- Give me that.
Hey, I'm going in, okay?
- Hey, Josh.
No.
- I'm sorry?
- It's the Senior Staff meeting.
- I'm Senior Staff.
- You don't have your briefing memo.
- How do you know?
I'm sorry.
Do you have it?
No.
- I memorized it.
- Did you get my e-mail on the three new rules for the week?
- I got it.
I read it.
It was good stuff.
It's possible the salient details escape me.
Rule number two:
You don't attend Daily Senior Staff without the briefing memo.
The agenda's outlined and there are up-to-the-minute details on priority items, and still half the meeting is spent regurgitating the memo for members who have difficulty holding onto salient details.
That's fair, and next time I'm gonna remember the memo.
I'm confident you will because you're gonna remember it this time too.
- You want me to go back and get it?
- I do.
Okay.
All right.
- I'm gonna humor the new girl.
- Appreciate it.
- Going to get your briefing memo?
- Yes.
Charlie, Security called for you.
They'd like to see you out front.
- Security?
- Yeah.
What the hell?
Anthony.
Michelle, he's with me.
- Which one?
- The regular-sized one.
Who are you?
- Orlando Kettles, boss, how you doing?
- Fine, thanks.
- Anthony.
- Yeah, you know, I brought him today.
First of all, they're a little prickly about security here.
You're not down as"Anthony plus one." You see the guns standing around now?
Boy's going to Columbus, starting right tackle for the Buckeyes.
True freshman.
I hand you the ball, run behind him, have coffee.
He's gonna play on Sundays.
- You his agent?
- Don't have nothing in writing.
- What's he doing here, Anthony?
- He got pulled over with an open can of Pabst.
- He was...
You were driving drunk?
No way, boss.
He passed the Breathalyzer.
It was the open can of Pabst.
But Saturday's St. Erasmus Academy, that's a big game for a senior.
- Wanna put a hurt on some blue blazers?
- Anthony.
Coach is gonna sit him down because of the Pabst, unless...
- Unless what?
- You know, you do your thing.
- My thing?
- Write him a note.
- Saying what?
- He's a good guy, Charlie.
- He does his business.
- I'm not Officer Krupke.
I have a job.
Try to think back to the days before you were secretary of state.
There are good guys and bad guys.
When good guys stop letting you play with them, bad guys have a recruiting field day.
When did you start talking like Mickey Spillane?
- I don't know.
Who's Officer Cupcake?
- Okay, you're seeing a musical.
Man, look at the size of him, Charlie.
He's not done growing either.
Who do you want him playing for?
What else has he got?
- What else?
- Priors.
Nothing, man.
I swear.
He stole a goat.
- A goat?
- Yeah.
Why did he...?
No.
I don't care.
- You got his Social Security number?
- Yeah.
- Orlando, got practice this afternoon?
- Oh, yeah.
You're not going.
It's Election Day.
You're gonna spend it with me.
Yo, man, I've done wind sprints, I'll take the swap.
Follow me.
This is the White House.
Frederick Douglass came here.
Mondays through Fridays we wear coats and ties.
You too, Mugsy.
Hey, Charlie, not for nothing, but so you know some higher-end places provide a jacket for you.
Right.
You're confusing the White House with the Friars Club.
The people I work with are serious, so don't embarrass me.
- You got it, boss.
- We're gonna have to wait till the Secret Service...
Sorry, man, that wasn't cool.
- How you doing?
- You all right?
He should...
You should play football.
Hey, man, I'm trying, you know, but I had an open Pabst and that's the way that goes.
- Yeah.
Let's go.
Rule number two:
Daily Senior Staff will something the briefing memo.
I have the memo, I'm going.
- Yeah.
No.
- No?
No, have you read rule number one?
The salient details...
The meeting starts on time.
If you're not there, you don't go in.
- That's insanity.
- Well, I'm quite mad.
There has to be a natural fluidity to these things.
It's how we work best.
You can't say that every meeting has to...
I didn't.
The e-mail, which is exactly this long, in case as a boy you had a frightening experience with Balzac, and that's why you didn't read it says,"This applies only to the Daily Senior Staff meeting."
One meeting it's gonna be important to be on time.
Well, I think that's a random cracking of the whip.
According to the last 300 daily diaries the president is typically 70 to 90 minutes over-scheduled by the end of the day.
The median time a day ends the over-under is 10:20 p.m.
As many days have ended after that time as have ended before it.
The result being, the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces hasn't had a night's sleep in four years.
That's both bad and easy to fix.
Okay.
Well, yes, that's hard to argue against.
I'll remember this talk next time.
I have confidence that you will.
Okay.
Well, I'm going in now, all right?
Sweet of you to tell me a joke, Josh.
You're the funny one, I can tell.
All right.
This is your little part of the store and I respect that.
See what I did there?
Respect.
No one's bigger than the game.
- You're an example for the kids.
- Yeah.
- I'm going out for about 20 minutes.
- Where?
There's a polling place nearby, I'm gonna find someone to swap votes.
A Ritchie supporter to vote for the president to offset my absentee ballot.
- Really.
- It's Election Day, I'm doing this.
- It's gonna take 20 minutes?
- Yeah, I'll be right back.
You bet.
Toby.
- He can't talk.
- Okay.
We're late for the first sonogram.
Big needle, 18 inches, right in the stomach, Toby, don't look at it.
- Yeah, that's amniocentesis.
- Hurts like heartbreak.
- You've had the procedure?
- Not me personally.
Toby, it's a good idea to slip the nurse something.
Tell her you're hoping for a smooth second trimester.
- You grease the nurse?
- He's kidding.
Give me one second, would you?
I'll catch up.
- Sports fans, this is getting exciting.
- Yes.
So, what do you think, like, 50 bucks?
I don't know, it's your first, it's twins.
I don't know, I think I'd give her 100.
Yeah, okay.
In your life you have never been on time to this meeting.
I wasn't actually.
I was just incredibly late to the meeting right before it.
- Well, that's the trick then.
- Yeah.
Sam, Will Bailey's on the phone if you want him.
That name sounds familiar.
He's a guy in California.
He's on the phone and I'm gonna talk to him now.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.
California 47th.
He was the guy running Horton Wilde?
- Yeah.
- They're gonna lose by 20 points.
Really?
You're getting that from the exits?
- Yeah.
- Great.
- Great?
- No.
I mean, it's a tough beat what with dying and all.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna talk to him now, okay?
- Okay.
- Hey.
- I think we're still up.
Josh says the exits have you down 20.
He means the tracking.
The last one was a week ago, then the DNC left town.
- He said the exits.
- Hey, when I said"exits" before I meant tracking.
They did the last one a week ago, then left town.
Yeah, they may have called that putt a little early.
Sam, it'd help if we could get added to the president's afternoon satellite.
- We could use some radio at drive time.
- Yeah.
Will, no kidding... ...drive time's also when the plants get out and the real Orange County votes that's when you turn into a pumpkin.
Don't get your hopes up.
No, just a good showing.
Cover the spread.
All right.
- What'd he say?
- Don't get hopes up.
- Are they?
- No.
Everybody on the street.
But we're gonna make history.
Roll Call has the pregnancy.
What?
Roll Call has the pregnancy.
C.J. just told me.
- When?
- A little while ago.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I didn't wanna ruin the day for you.
- Then why are you telling me now?
- I couldn't help it.
- Roll Call has it from where?
- The Office of the Congressional.
Thanks.
- What are you saying that to me for?
- No, I was...
I was saying it to them.
I was asking it.
Out of curiosity, how long did you think this was going to be covert?
These are twins, Andy.
You think you're gonna go on Meet the Press and Russert won't notice you're the size of a school?
Why not just come out and say:
"I'm expecting twins, I couldn't be happier.
The father's my ex-husband, Toby Ziegler, to whom I'll be remarried on a date to be decided upon.
- I'm thinking Christmas."
- I'm not marrying you again.
Then say the first part at least.
I hadn't announced it because you don't in the first 12 weeks because that's when most of the things go wrong.
These bodies of yours, I don't know how you live with them.
- They don't seem to mind.
- I like the outsides.
Hello, Andrea.
Toby.
Hi.
Honey, if you're gonna get grossed out and faint, you should sit.
- She's kidding.
- How've you been feeling?
- I feel great.
Feel like you're getting enough calcium?
- What does that feel like?
- I don't know either.
It's just something we ask.
We don't even care about the answer.
You should draft a release.
Let that be my first act of fatherhood, drafting your release.
Go back to my roots as we all must go.
Now you're on offense, not defense.
I'm not gonna be on offense or defense.
The things we do in our lives many of them are not voluntary.
- You don't say.
I think you've performed your first act of fatherhood already.
Yes, indeed.
So let my second act be throwing you a little press conference.
Sounds fine.
I, myself, can't make it, but you have a nice time, honey.
Do I need to tell you the first rule of damage control?
No, but the next time you refer to this pregnancy as damage...
Get the information out early, get it out yourself do it on your own terms.
- That's three rules.
Andy, look.
I'm not kidding.
You gotta...
- What was that?
- That was...
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, that was...
Andy, you can see their heads.
My kids have heads.
My vote in Wisconsin is more valuable than your vote in the District you're getting big value.
- How do you figure?
The president's gonna win the District, it's certain.
But Wisconsin's actually in play and I voted for your guy.
- How do I know that?
- I've shown you the ballot, look.
- Well, that's a photocopy.
- Of course it's a photocopy.
- The real one's in Wisconsin.
- Well, how do I know that?
You don't.
This is an honor thing.
It's about honor and democracy.
I'm gonna go vote now, so please stop talking to me.
Fine.
You think I'm trying to scam you?
I've been here two and a half hours trying to get one vote.
You think this is how I make money?
Hey, you know what?
No problem shouting in public, but I think...
- Take off the Bartlet button?
- Yeah.
Josh told me you were still here.
I was over at the place.
Thanks.
- You wanna get a muffin?
- Yeah, I'll walk you.
So, what's going on?
It's raining in Oregon.
Yeah.
Yeah, Josh was talking about that before.
Apparently all his other problems are solved.
If your guy's gonna win big, you don't want it to rain.
There's less motivation anyway because of the blowout and you have no idea how fast these things can become a race.
- What do you need?
- A banana muffin, please.
I did something last week.
I went to see a guy named Will Bailey.
He ran Horton Wilde's campaign in Orange County and Wilde died a couple of weeks ago his widow wanted to know what Democrat would stand in for her husband, should he win.
I said...
- You're kidding.
- You have to understand.
This wasn't something that cost me anything.
They weren't gonna announce unless Wilde won and that was never gonna happen in Orange County.
It's like the Secretary of Agriculture saying:
"Sure I'm ready to assume the presidency should the 18 who come before me die."
- Why not?
- So why not?
Because it's a two-point race right now.
- This is very exciting.
- No, it's not.
The prospect of going back on my word to a recent widow.
So why go back on it?
Because the alternative is taking 90 days off to go home lose by 20 points to a Republican committee chair I hate and never be able to run for public office for real which is something I wouldn't mind doing one day.
Once 5:00 and 6:00 roll around.
That's exactly what I'm thinking.
Except?
- What?
- There's an El Niño thing going on in Southern California today and...
- No.
It's supposed to start raining in a few hours.
Okay.
- Okay, I'm gonna go back to the office.
- Okay.
- Why don't you give me the button.
- Yeah.
You're cleared.
You can come upstairs.
Thanks.
There are chairs up there that are over 200 years old.
Before you sit in one I wanna see written confirmation from the Army Corps of Engineers that it can support your girth.
You stole a goat?
I'm assuming this was a mascot?
Yeah, that was sweet.
I was just the legman.
Anthony's the brains.
Yeah, it had that international jewel thief feel to it.
What do you think we're doing the rest of the day?
- You know, video games, hanging out.
- Really?
I'm voting at 8:30, you guys will come with me, watch me vote, then go home.
Man, what good is...?
I mean, they're not gonna let me vote.
It's like my face is pressed up to the window.
That's right, yet somehow, I don't care.
I'm old enough to vote.
- You're 18?
- I'm 19.
They came to school to sign up people.
- You're registered to vote?
- I think I might be, yeah.
- Where?
- He doesn't know where.
- I don't know where.
- Well, let's find out.
- Good afternoon, Mr. President.
- Good afternoon, sir.
Hello.
Hi.
- What's going on?
- Line one now is a DSS line.
It means Direct Station Select.
Pick it up, you get me.
What was wrong with the old way?
- You done?
- Yes, ma'am.
Thanks a lot.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- What was wrong with the old way?
- Well, this is better.
- How?
You don't care, sir, it just is.
I hear you've got rules for meetings.
Yes, some.
Yes, I do, sir.
You don't think that's apt to create resentment among people here before...
It's not like the thing wasn't working.
Whatever you assume, that wasn't a rube sitting out there.
She ran the Oval Office for two years and a State House before that.
Yes, sir.
At any rate, line one gets you me.
What if, instead of you, I want a dial tone?
That's line two, but you're not gonna want one.
- Why?
- I'm gonna place your outgoing calls.
- You'll place a lot of them...
- No, sir, I need to place them all.
I can make my own phone call...
- Sir.
- I can make my own phone call.
Yes, but soon you might not necessarily remember that you did.
When I call, there's a record.
That's how you'll know.
And then you won't be worried about it.
That's good.
That's a good idea.
- Is there anything else?
- No.
Thank you, Mr. President.
You and I haven't met.
In my life, I never would've thought she was a rube.
I'm sorry about that.
Debbie, I have to ask you:
Are we talking about...?
Did you bring it up because you...?
- Is there something today you noticed?
- No, sir.
Do you feel all right?
Should I...?
No, please.
I was talking about something else.
Line one is you?
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.
Will, you have Sheryl Cryman that's the County Clerk's legal counsel, it's blinking.
Sheryl, it's Will Bailey, how you doing?
Fine, thank you.
There are scattered power outages in the Casa Verde precinct in Santa Ana.
Streetlights are going off in the only legitimately Democratic precinct I've got.
So if I lose by 100 because people couldn't cross the street who in your office would I talk to about election tampering?
Thanks a lot, Sheryl.
I appreciate it.
Pull sound trucks from Laguna Hills, not enough foot traffic.
- Put them in Anaheim.
- Will.
- When the hell's it gonna rain?
- Willy.
Don't call me that.
The die's been cast, big brother, you're making everyone crazy.
There's a moment after you cast the die, before it hits the table.
Breathe wrong, you'll change the way it lands.
Can I get a new weather report?
There's value here, there's value, gotta appreciate the value.
- A Ritchie vote in Wisconsin.
- Let me ask you this.
Bartlet's supposed to be smart, right?
He's smart, we're dumb, he knows best.
So what does it say when his people don't know how to fill out a ballot?
Maybe he's a little out of touch.
Is that what it says?
Maybe even with the president's supporters accidentally voting for the wrong candidate you're still gonna get creamed, fascist!
- This is an honor thing!
- Excuse me.
Yes.
Hi.
- Did somebody steal your purse?
- Me?
No.
- Okay.
- I'm on a mission.
I said I'd be 20 minutes.
It's been six hours and it's starting to get cold.
Okay.
You were shouting at no one.
- Little guy.
Bow tie.
- Long as you're okay.
Wait.
Hang on.
Do you mind if I ask you who you're voting for?
- I guess I do, yeah.
- That's fair, that's perfectly fair.
Let me ask you this instead:
Are you voting for Ritchie or the president?
- I'm gonna go inside now, okay?
- Lieutenant, I'm not a crazy person I'm not asking you for the bomb sequence on the USS Essex.
- Be a man, tell me who you're voting for.
- Ritchie, and you demoted me a rank.
I'm so sorry.
I'm seeing your shoulders now, Lieutenant Commander.
Reese.
Reese is a nice name.
Reese what?
Lieutenant Commander Reese.
Jack Reese.
Can I talk to you?
You know, this is the first election I haven't had to vote by absentee ballot.
I really wanted to pull the lever.
Absentee ballot, I know how you feel.
I'm from Wisconsin.
It's my home, but here I am in Washington on Election Day.
I'm usually on a Los Angeles-class sub in the South China Sea.
Don't trump me.
It's not a battle.
We're in this together.
No, we're not.
I voted absentee in Wisconsin.
I voted for Ritchie.
I meant to vote for the president.
Now I think you should go in there and vote the other way to make it a wash.
- Yeah, okay.
- Look...
Really?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
- I'm Donna.
- Jack.
- Commander.
- Jack's fine.
So why aren't you on a sub right now?
I haven't been for a little while.
- What's your billet?
- It used to be Regional Director for the office of Joint Chiefs of Southeast Asia, but I got transferred.
Nancy McNally's office.
She's the National Security Advisor.
- You're working at the White House?
- Yeah.
Listen I gotta go vote, okay?
- Yeah, sure.
Listen, I've got a photocopy of my absentee ballot if you wanna verify that I...
- No, no.
It's an honor thing, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now there are late exits showing even with white male suburbans in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia.
There's huge labor turnout, we're only losing Florida by seven.
Seven.
Toby, I think it's gonna be bigger than we thought.
I stare at this and I stare at this and I don't know which is the boy and which is the girl.
I suppose that problem will take care of itself.
You know, if you, if you stare at them for a while well, it's pretty gross, but still...
- I'm concerned you've turned...
I see one victory balloon before this thing is called and...
Yeah, you better run.
Nothing.
- You read the stuff?
- Yeah.
- It wasn't long.
- Yeah.
I was impartial, right?
I gave you the best and worst of each.
Hey, Mr. Young I'm not being disrespectful or nothing, but I'm just trying to concentrate.
Listen, this is easy.
You can do it no problem but if you need to, you can ask for help, you're allowed.
Okay.
Hey, listen, why does a guy who's heading off to the Big Ten care about playing St. Erasmus Academy on Saturday?
You're gonna be playing Michigan and Penn State.
I don't know.
It's what I do on Saturdays.
Hey, you know what?
I know I'm not the sharpest tool in the box or nothing but try rushing the quarterback, you know what I'm saying?
You're not gonna get there, you're not gonna touch him.
You're up.
He's a good guy, you know.
He does his business.
He just doesn't like looking like a fool.
- How long did you hang onto the goat?
- Three days.
- Three days.
- Yeah.
What'd you feed him?
- Cheetos.
- Okay.
Hey.
Hey, Anthony, I voted.
All right.
- I'm going again.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Will!
- Come on.
Come inside and have something to eat with us.
Come on.
- Will.
- Now!
Jesus.
Wow.
What else can you do?
I didn't know I could do that!
- It's on.
You can see it.
- Hey.
I'm not spitting, I'm not turning around.
Union households are beating non-union.
- C.J. Can you pick up three?
- Yeah.
This is C.J. Thanks.
- What was that?
- You'll see in a minute.
Nine o'clock.
Good evening, Mr. President.
I feel like I should be self-deprecating.
I mean, it's not inauguration, I can be funny, right?
I don't think so.
It's the wrong note.
If I'm thanking campaign staff, maybe.
- What are you doing?
- We've got some news.
What?
What?
You're gonna win New Hampshire.
With seventy of the precincts reporting, CBS is ready to declare Delaware... ... with its three electoral votes for President Bartlet.
Closing an hour ago, NBC is putting Maryland in the President's column.
With 22 percent of the vote tallied in Maine...
Polls are closed in West Virginia...
The polls closing in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania...
Halfway around the world in Bosnia, in Chechnya, in Rwanda they dream of the promise we fulfilled today.
Of a future we choose, for ourselves, together.
Sam, what's going on?
They're not calling it.
With 8 percent of the precincts reporting, remains too close to call.
My goodness, if you lived to be 100, did you think... ...you'd ever see anything like this?
- I did not.
Four years ago, we were joined by our highest ideals, by our best hopes and tonight we're joined by that same commitment.
To open new doors of opportunity and justice.
To ensure that the promise of this country is the birthright of all the people.
We've achieved so much together always believing, always knowing that America could be made new again.
And so it was, and so it will be again.
God bless you all.
God bless the United States of America.
We're gonna skip the parties for a while and head back to the office.
There are nine House races too close to call.
Tell him about California.
- In the California 47th...
- In the 47th...
You don't tell it well.
In the 47th, Horton Wilde, who's dead, is losing by 88 votes.
- It was a perfect storm.
- It was.
Low Republican turnout because the president won the Midwest.
Low supporter turnout because Webb had no opponent and the DNC gave up on it a week ago, so the RNC left town and they never saw the exits your guy, Will Bailey, was seeing.
Plus there was an actual storm.
I tell it fine.
We're gonna be up all night with these.
It's gonna be fun.
We should go.
- That was wonderful.
- That was fun.
- How are you feeling?
- I feel great.
- You want a glass of water?
- No, I'm fine.
You seem a little dry.
- Sure you don't want a glass of water?
- Yeah.
Maybe I should get you a glass of water just in case you can hold it in your hand.
How'd you know?
You were off the prompter.
Just for a minute at the end.
I couldn't see it.
It's all right.
There are gonna be more days like this.
It starts now.
It's gonna be harder this time.
Yeah, I know.
We can still have tonight, though, right?
You got lots of nights.
Smart people who love you are gonna have your back.
All right.
Excuse me.
You wanna take another curtain call?
Sure.

Whoa!
Thank you.
There you go.
And I will just sit down right here.
Actually, right here.
[Football Game On TV Playing] Doug!
Well, come on!
Let me watch!
I'm here, the Jets are on, it's fate!
You're here every day, and the place is owned by a retired Jet.
It's not that miraculous.
Now up!
Up!
All right.
[Cheering On TV] Go, go.
Ow!
Next time, it's a steak knife.
Now, sit down.
Fine.
You know, you could try and make conversation with me.
You're right.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Are you trying to see the reflection of the TV in my eyes?
That would be crazy.
Fumble!
Doug, come on!
Stay with me here.
Stay with me, honey.
Come on.
Please.
I'm trying to enjoy our last moments of freedom before your mom comes into town.
Hey, that's no way to talk about the woman who brought all this into the world.
All right, if she brought all of that into the world, she would be dead.
Hey, you guys get menus?
Menus?
You're adorable.
Take out your pad.
Doug?
Oh, my God.
Margy Colletti!
Ohh!
Carrie, this is my high school girlfriend.
Margy--Margy, this is my wife Carrie.
Hey, great to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Awkward!
Wife meeting ex-girlfriend.
Couldn't be more uncomfortable.
Was he this much of an idiot back in high school?
Oh, sure.
He was just like that, but acne.
Ah, yeah.
So, uh...
what are you doing?
I mean, last I heard you were married to some doctor in Connecticut.
Yeah, I was till a couple of months ago.
Now I'm divorced, back here, waiting tables.
Kind of like Cinderella in reverse.
Sweetheart, still waiting on that pie.
Coming.
Hey, by the way, you must be excited that your mom's coming into town.
Yeah, I am.
How'd you know she was coming in?
We keep in touch.
Really?
Yeah, yeah.
You know, Christmas cards.
Funny e-mails.
Does she send you guys the joke of the day?
Uh, no, not since we blocked her from our computer.
So what can I get ya?
Well, now that I've heard it out loud, some kind of pie, and any entrée you think will go well before it.
How about a bacon cheeseburger?
Welcome home, Margy Colletti.
So?
New?
I had my annual review at IPS, and it turns out your son... is an average worker.
Yeah.
Good for you, Dougie.
You see what happens when you roll your sleeves up?
Doug, can I see you for a second?
Oh.
Yeah, sure.
What's up?
OK, take this out.
Here are the cookies and spoons.
Go, go, go.
Whoa, settle down.
We're still eating.
Well, eat faster.
Carrie, this is a brunch.
"Brunch" means slow lunch.
Well, then we're having "funch"--
Fast lunch.
Come on, if we get done by 12:00,
I can make it to spinning, all right?
Get mama going!
Come on, I put some ice cubes in there so she'll drink it faster.
Go, go!
[Doorbell Rings]
You're never gonna believe who that is.
Margy Colletti.
How did you know?
Well, we ran into her yesterday, and I can see her through the window.
Oh, fiddlesticks.
I was gonna surprise ya.
Um, you didn't invite her to eat, did you?
Oh, no.
She's just picking me up.
We're going shopping.
Oh.
Hey!
Hi, honey!
Oh, it's so good to see you!
Margy, it's one thing stalking me in a public place, but this is my home, damn it!
Yeah, good one, Doug.
So, where you guys headed?
Well, I just moved into the Sunrise Apartments, and Janet said she'd help me decorate.
And she's always had such good taste.
Oh, stop.
You do.
I don't.
You do.
She does.
I don't.
OK.
Let's agree to disagree, OK?
Well, I guess I do have kind of a flair.
OK, let's hit the mall.
I promise I won't have her back too late.
OK.
Bye, kids!
Bye.
Oh, Carrie.
Brunch was delightful.
Sorry I had to cut it short.
[Door Closes]
There you go.
Now you can catch your spinning class.
And don't worry.
Those dirty dishes will be right there when you get back.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I just--
Don't you think it's a little weird your ex-girlfriend's coming around and hanging out with your mom?
[Sighs] Here we go again.
I am with you.
I took a vow for God's sakes.
Trust that.
This has nothing to do with you, Doug.
All right?
It's about Margy and your mom.
I mean, did you hear those two?
"I love you." "No, I love you."
God, I thought they were gonna make out.
Did you just call my mom a lesbian?
Doug, come on.
I'm serious.
I mean, your mom shouldn't be running around with Margy.
She should be staying here and having brunch with us.
Wait a second.
You were just trying to get the hell out of here.
Remember "funch"?
What the hell happened to funch?
!
And another thing, she's decorating her apartment?
I mean, what-- what's--
She never showed any interest in this place.
She made us those curtains, you threw 'em out.
They had rainbows with pots of gold on them.
And, anyway, that's not even the point!
I think it is the point.
The only reason you want mom is 'cause Margy's got her.
What?
No!
No, I love--
I love spending time with your mom.
And she should love spending time with me.
Well, I gotta tell you, you don't exactly throw out the "hang with me" vibe.
And what is that supposed to mean?
Just kind of like...
[Imitates Cat Hissing]
Well, at least I don't walk around being huge.
What, you just did the cat thing.
That was just harmless fun.
You're clearly not a cat.
You know, I gotta say I was little surprised that you wanted my help picking out a dress, dear.
Really?
Why?
I've always liked your sense of style.
Really?
Yeah, like look at that pin you're wearing.
What do you got there, an elephant?
Oh, yeah.
It's for good luck.
Ah!
You know what?
It's yours.
No, no, no.
No, no.
That's your elephant.
No, no, I couldn't.
I couldn't.
I couldn't.
I couldn't, really.
Fine.
♪ I know what I'm getting someone for Christmas ♪
So, where are we here?
Uh, give me a little more information about this function you need the dress for.
Oh, it's a dinner at my boss' house.
We won a lawsuit over clean water.
I'm not sure what side we're on.
Well, you know, if it's a dinner, this could be a way to go.
Yes!
That is definitely a way to go.
It is, but how 'bout this?
Are you posing for Playboy magazine, dear?
No, I am not.
You know, the more I look around, the more I realize this is the one.
Well, OK!
If you love it, then I love it.
I love it.
Then I love it.
Well, I'm glad I could help.
I'm glad you can help, too.
Let's just go ahead and ring this bad boy right up, huh?
OK.
Thank you.
So, after this I think you and I--
[Cell Phone Rings] Oh, excuse me, dear.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Margy.
What's cooking?
Uh-huh.
Carrie and I are at the Dress Barn.
We're done, right?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah, we're done.
So, I'll just shoot right down there.
I'll see you in a few.
Doug:
What do you want me to do?
I want you to talk to your mother.
No, no.
I'm not getting involved.
OK, fine.
I'll talk to her.
Whoa!
What are you gonna say?
I'm gonna tell her that I don't think it's appropriate that she spends so much time with her son's ex-girlfriend, that it's disrespectful to me.
Yeah, I can't allow that.
Why not?
I want this out in the open.
I don't know how you handle problems in your family, but in my family, we sweep 'em under the rug, then we eat.
It's worked for generations.
Tough.
I'm talking to her.
Carrie, you can't.
I think it's a bad idea.
Look, my mom will be upset, and she'll start to cry.
And when she cries, she doesn't just cry, OK?
She blubbers.
And she'll continue blubbering until you sweep the problem back under the rug where all serious problems belong.
All right, fine.
You talk to Margy.
You want me to sit down with my ex-- alone-- and talk?
Yeah.
Just me and a former lover.
You're not worried about that?
Yeah, I think I'll roll those dice.
Doug:
Hey, Margy.
Hey, Doug!
You here for Finger Fest?
No.
No, actually, I came down here to talk to you about something.
Hey, is Finger Fest instead of Wing Madness or in addition to?
Not sure.
I'm just a waitress.
You know, I'm kinda out of the loop creatively.
Keep me posted.
Hey, look.
Didn't we have our first date in this booth?
Yeah, actually we did.
We came here after we saw a 4-foot black man change the face of music in Purple Rain.
Great movie.
I showed you a pretty sweet evening that night, huh?
Yeah, you did.
Until you shot your straw wrapper at me and scratched my cornea.
I probably should've known at that point that we weren't meant to be.
You know when I knew we weren't meant to be?
When you started cheating on me with Ricky LeDouche.
It's Ricky LeDoux, and I only got together with him because it was obvious you weren't serious about me.
That's not true.
I wrote that song about you, for God's sakes.
Again with that stupid song.
You told me for 2 years that you were gonna write it.
I did!
Then how come I never heard it?
Because while I was putting the finishing touches on it, you were rolling around with LeDouche.
LeDoux, it's LeDoux.
And by the way, that nickname really hurt his feelings.
[Mock Crying] LeDouche is sad!
OK.
OK, fine.
Sing me the song you wrote.
I told you I never got a chance to completely finish it.
Yeah, you were pretty good at not finishing things, weren't ya?
You never finished fixing up your car, you never finished college--
I wrote the song!
Sure you did.
I gotta get back to work.
Margy, I wrote the song, OK?
!
Hey, is Finger Fest instead of Wing Madness?
I thought we were gonna watch the game.
Where the hell is it?
You know, I'm sitting here by myself.
Haven't been offered any refreshments!
I can't right now, OK?
I'm looking for this love song
I wrote to Margy Colletti.
Margy Colletti?
The one whose cornea you destroyed?
OK, I didn't destroy it.
She had to wear an eye patch for a semester.
Big whoop.
Hey, would you look in that box right there?
What do you gotta look for this now?
Because she doesn't believe I wrote it, OK?
She was so smug about it, too.
"Oh, you never finish anything."
Yeah.
She's obviously never eaten with you.
Ha ha ha ha.
Look in there, OK?
Any cassettes?
Yeah, yeah.
Let's see.
We got Cheap Trick Live at Budokan, 1-2-3 Spanish, and The Margy Song.
That's it.
That's it!
Here we go.
Sweet vindica-she-eeone.

But I think if you're gonna do this, we should open up the box a little.

Hey, Doug.
Did you, uh-- Did you talk to Margy?
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
Uh...
And is she gonna stay away from your mom?
I don't know.
I did my best, but I'm not sure it sunk in.
She's pretty attached.
Really?
Mmm.
Unbelievable.
Friggin' Margy just can't stay away from her little advice whore.
Did you just call my mom a whore?
I gotta go.
I gotta go to my boss' dinner.
I'll see you guys later.
What are you doing with the keyboard?
Uh...
Doug's helping me write a couple of songs for the IPS follies.
I'm, uh, musical director.
I actually am.
Janet.
What are you doing?
Oh, pardon me.
I'm just trying to pick a color for Margy's bedroom.
Something like this might be nice.
You mind if she comes over and takes a look?
All right.
You know what?
We gotta talk.
About what, dear?
Janet, I'm your daughter-in-law, and you're just spending all this time with Margy.
You know?
I'm just wondering if maybe you would've been happier if Doug would've married her.
[Crying] Oh, my God.
What have I done?
OK.
Whoa.
OK.
Uh...
No, no, no.
It's--it's really-- it's not just you.
You know, I could've tried harder, you know?
I...
Wow.
Doug wasn't kidding.
Here, here.
Why don't you--
Here, probably softer than that fabric swatch.
Thank you.
Oh, Carrie.
I am so, so, so sorry.
I never meant to make you feel badly.
No, I know you didn't, but... but you did.
But it's OK!
But it's OK now!
It really is OK.
Listen to me, darling.
Margy is a very sweet person, but make no mistake, you are my daughter-in-law.
No.
My daughter.
Thank you, Janet.
Mom.
And Margy is just gonna have to finish decorating her apartment without me.
My time is for you.
Well, thank you, Janet.
That means a lot to me.
All right, I'm gonna get dressed for that dinner, Mom.
All right, sweetheart.
You're not gonna wear the dress we bought together?
Oh, no.
I was just yanking this for the dry cleaners.
It's gotta go to the dry cleaners.
Oh, here it is.
I'm gonna wear this.
Oh, I'll give you some privacy.
OK.
Oy.
[Cell Phone Rings]
Hello?
Oh, hi, Margy.
No.
No, dear, I absolutely can't come over now.
All right.
Fine, fine.
But I can only stay for 5 minutes.
[Turns Off Cell Phone]
Hey.
Ohh!
You look beautiful.
You're gonna get some compliments tonight.
Yeah.
I'm sure people will be talking about it.
Hey, you going someplace?
Uh, yes.
Uh...
I--I've got to go pick up some diabetes medicine for my Uncle Norman.
Right.
So, uh, well, have a wonderful evening.
Thanks.
Uncle Norman, my ass.
I would definitely go with the blue.
Now, darling, I really do have to get going.
Oh, no, just stay a few more minutes.
You haven't even touched your wine.
A few minutes, fine.
[Knock On Door]
Carrie?
Oh, my God!
Carrie, it's not what you think.
Oh, no?
She needed me.
I'm just in and out to help with the couch and the carpet.
And to polish off a bottle of chardonnay, I see.
Get your coat.
We're going home.
Really, it's not what you think--
Coat, now, Mom.
Well, can't she just stay to help me pick out the tiles?
OK, listen to me, sweetheart.
You had a mother-in-law and you blew it, OK?
This one's mine, so mitts off.
What?
What?
Hello?
You're through, OK?
You're out of our lives.

Everything's ready now.
It took a bit longer than I thought.
I'm having dinner at Bernard and Marie's.
I can't wait to be at your place...

I have to get used to that.
Take care.

How much?
How much do you want for it?
- 15,000 francs.
- Are you crazy?
Poor little car...
The latest traffic news, or rather, traffic-jam news.
Paris is at a standstill due to the public-transport strike.
You all know that now.
The city is choking, everyone is exhausted.
I'll never get there.
At times like this, we need to be... charitable towards others.
Try carpooling.
If you see cold and weary people hitching a ride... take them part of the way with you in your car.
Try it.
I did it once, it was fun.
Excuse me...
I can give you a lift, if you want.
No thanks, I'd rather walk, it's quicker.
CHARITY SHOP CLOTHES
I'll keep this.
Okay!

Yes, of course.
I didn't hear where you want to go.
Leave me where you want.
It's warm in here.
- Shall I turn it down?
- No, it's okay.
Are you all right?
Are you sure you're all right?
I think I dozed off for a second.
Never mind.
Fancy a cigarette to wake you up?
I've given up but I don't mind if you smoke.
Black is black.
No hope in sight.
Paris is at a standstill and you're stuck... for the evening, tonight and tomorrow.
If you've been invited to dinner, it's going to get cold.
I can leave you here.
You'll go more quickly on foot.
I'm in no hurry.
You can leave me wherever it suits you.
My name's Laure.
I'm Jean.
Sorry.
The traffic situation is worse than usual.
It's as hard as ever getting anywhere...
In theory, I turn here.
In theory, but it won't be easy.
Try it.
Thank you.
We're almost there.
Well done.
I'm eating with some friends.
Do you want to come?
All right.
No smoking, please, because of the baby.
Sorry.
You've changed your mind?
Yes, a shortcut.
Shall we have dinner together?
Yes.
Why didn't you let me through?
Stop yelling.
You're the maniac here.
- There was no room!
- A maniac, period.
- There was room but you moved!
- You saw I was moving!
I had the right-of-way anyhow.
What the hell's this right-of-way shit?
Let's fill out the insurance form.
Fuck you and your shit form!

- What?
- Did you hear that?
- Shut it.
- Fuck your crate to hell!

Fucking hell!
My car's a wreck!
Don't make it worse!
I'll make a quick phone call.
Stop it!
Fuck his crate!
The guy's hysterical!
Do something!
You asshole!
Fuck you!
Get off him!
- Do something!
- I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, you hear me?
Take your insurance papers, you goddamn lunatic!
Do something.
They'll kill each other.
Laure, get yourself a bloody cell phone!
No one can come because of the strike.
It's all off.
Come over anyway.
Come over.
You've nothing left at home.
We'll fix something.
That way, you'll get to see the baby.
No thanks.
I've been packing boxes all day.
I'm worn out.
The removal men come at 8:00.
I can't take the car anywhere tonight.
It's hell.
Know what happened to Bernard when he left the office?
I have to go.
Other people want the phone.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Take care.
Give Francois my love.
Just a second, Lulu.
Stop crying now, okay?
Shit, my car!
My car!
Shit!
Excuse me...
Have you seen my car?
It was just here.
In front of me?
And you can't find it.
It must've flown off.
I shouldn't have left the keys.
Why did I leave him my car?
Here you write Mr...
I can't, there's not enough room.
It doesn't matter.
I'm not cold.
It doesn't matter.
Never mind.
I'm not cold.
Where are you going?
Come on.
I thought you'd seen me but you vanished.
You don't leave a car like that.
Get in.
We'll try something.
Stop.
I want to get out.
- What's wrong?
- Let me go.
- What's wrong?
- Let go of me.

I want to go home.
-Calm down.
It's your car, so I'll get out and go.
Good night.
- Careful, you'll get into tilt.
- Shit.
- What's tilt?
- Sorry?
- What's tilt?
- When you shake it too much.
Try a little...
Then catch the ball.
Good evening.
Coffee.
Two coffees, please.
Okay?
- You scalded yourself?
- Yes.
Because it's hot.
We're in no hurry.
We have time.
Plenty of time.
Want a glass of water?
Could we have a glass of water, please?
- What's wrong?

Uh-huh...

Lucky I heard you or you'd have been locked out.
You're right.
If we find nothing, we can go back.
We'll find something.
Could you choose quickly?
The chef leaves soon.
Usually we close late on Fridays but with the strike...
I'm cold.
Can we switch tables?
- Can we switch tables?
- Yes, of course.
Does this suit you?
What do you want?
I don't know yet.
What about you?
I'll have the antipasto and then a Neapolitan pizza.
Me too.

No thanks, I'm not hungry.
Maybe something's happened to her.
Nothing can happen.
Her husband's here.
Someone should check.
Excuse me... could I have another carafe of wine?
What are you thinking of?
Me?
Careful, the plate's hot.
I'll have the same spaghetti, please.

BECAUSE UNLIKE YOU, I HAD FUN THIS WEEKEND.
HEY, WE HAD PLENTY OF FUN.
YEAH?
I'LL BET I CAN GUESS WHAT EVERY ONE OF YOU DID.
OKAY.
TOOK A VITA-BATH AND LISTENED TO DIDO.
HA HA.
THE SAME.
MADE PRANK CALLS TELLING PEOPLE TO COME
PICK UP FREE BIG-SCREEN TVs IN ATLANTIC CITY.
RENTED A U-HAUL, DROVE TO ATLANTIC CITY.
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF CHARLIE'S NEW STYLE?
WELL, IT LOOKS FINE TO ME.
THANK YOU, SIR.
OF COURSE, HE WOULD LOOK BETTER
IF HE WERE ON THE COVER OF A GRAND FUNK RAILROAD ALBUM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]
HELLO?
Tracy:
HEY, BABY.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY UP.
I HOPE YOU ARE SO PSYCHED TO PARTY ALL NIGHT,
BECAUSE I GOT US VIP TICKETS TO KABOOM.
OH, I'M SO PSYCHED.
I'VE BEEN DYING TO GET INTO THAT PLACE.
AND WE ARE GOING TO PARTY ALL NIGHT.
SO, ARE YOU HAVING F-- SEE YA.
HI.
KABOOM?
THIS IS CHARLIE CRAWFORD, DEPUTY MAYOR.
YEAH, WE GOT TO SHUT YOU DOWN TONIGHT.
YOUR KITCHEN'S IN VIOLATION OF A CITY HEALTH CODE.
NO KITCHEN?
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO LEVEL WITH YOU.
I'M WITH THE VICE SQUAD.
WE NEED TO USE YOUR CLUB TO STAKE OUT
THE SEEDY ESTABLISHMENT ACROSS THE STREET FROM YOU.
YES, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE READING ROOM.
CHARLIE.
CHARLIE, WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT EVERY NIGHT THIS WEEK,
AND YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
NOTHING.
I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME.
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY HAVING AN EARLY MIDLIFE CRISIS.
I MEAN, I'M ROUGHLY YOUR AGE,
AND YOU DON'T SEE ME DATING 23-YEAR-OLDS.
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE REPULSED BY YOU.
OH, THAT DOESN'T HOLD UP.
SO ARE 50-YEAR-OLDS, AND I DATE THEM.
CHARLIE, AS YOUR FRIEND,
I FEEL COMPELLED TO TELL YOU
THAT THOSE SIDEBURNS REALLY DO COME OFF
AS A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO CLING TO YOUR YOUTH.
KIND OF LIKE THE WAY YOU SHAVE YOUR HEAD
SO PEOPLE WON'T SEE YOUR BALD SPOT?
HA HA HA.
GOOD ONE, CHARLIE.
AT LEAST I DON'T LOOK LIKE THE THIRD DUKE OF HAZZARD.
IF YOU GUYS DON'T MIND,
I NEED TO GET READY TO GO OUT.
CHARLIE, WHY DON'T YOU ACCEPT
THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH TRACY?
SO I'M A LITTLE TIRED.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME.
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW.
YOU'RE TOO BUSY PLAYING BINGO
WITH TRACY'S DAD.
HEY, BINGO IS VERY HIP THESE DAYS.
BESIDES, WHEN I CLOSE DOWN A BAR,
AT LEAST I DON'T DO IT OVER THE PHONE.
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]
HEY, CHARLIE.
HEY, CAITLIN.
HEY.
SO, READY TO GO TO KABOOM?
YES.
YOU WANT TO COME?
REALLY?
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU ARE DATING MY DAD,
AND YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET TO KNOW ME BETTER.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING?
I WANT TO GO.
SORRY, I CAN'T GET ANY MORE PEOPLE
ON THE VIP LIST, AND YOU'D HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.
YEAH, PAUL, I'M SURE YOU GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO
THAN WAIT IN THE FREEZING COLD FOR SIX HOURS
TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME BOUNCER YOU'RE WORTHY OF GETTING IN.
SHOULD I WEAR JEANS?
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S MARTIN DAVIS.
HE'S THE BIGGEST ART DEALER IN THE CITY.
I'M GUESSING HE'S ALSO GAY.
WHY, JUST BECAUSE HE'S DRESSED WELL?
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCKING IN YOUR STOMACH.
I'LL ADMIT IT'S TRUE.
I'VE HAD A LITTLE CRUSH ON HIM FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
HE JUST LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE
STUFFY, PRETENTIOUS, HIGH-SOCIETY SNOBS.
I KNOW.
HE'S PERFECT.
SIR, WHAT WAS MARTIN DAVIS DOING HERE?
HE INVITED ME TO A FUND-RAISER HE'S THROWING TONIGHT.
I BOUGHT A FEW SEATS, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GO.
IT'S FOR PREDOMINANTLY GAY MEN.
I DON'T THINK I FIT IN.
SIR, YOU WERE THE GRAND MARSHAL AT THE GAY PRIDE PARADE.
YOU SEEMED COMFORTABLE.
YEAH, BUT I WAS HIGH ABOVE THE CROWD
IN THAT LEANING TOWER OF PISA FLOAT.
THAT WASN'T THE LEANING TOWER OF PISA.
THAT WAS A GIANT -- NO.
SIR...
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU ATTEND.
MARTIN DAVIS COULD BE A VERY INFLUENTIAL SUPPORTER
OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION.
WELL, THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE.
TELL YOU WHAT -- I'LL GO ALONG TO HELP OUT.
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA, CARTER.
IT'S A DATE.
WAIT, IF PEOPLE SEE US TOGETHER,
THEY MAY GET THE WRONG IDEA.
STUART, WHY DON'T YOU COME?
OH, I'D LOVE TO, SIR.
GREAT.
IT'S A THREESOME.
NOTHING GAY ABOUT THAT.
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA GO?
WHY WOULDN'T I?
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE POPULATED BY THE GAY ELITE OF THIS CITY.
YOU DON'T BELONG.
I TAKE YOU TO STRAIGHT EVENTS.
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU KNOW WOMEN LOVE GAY MEN.
YOU USE ME AS BAIT.
OH, YOU FIGURED THAT OUT?
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.
I'M GOING.
GOING WHERE?
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING?
I WANT TO GO.
IT'S A FUND-RAISER.
THE MAYOR CAN ONLY PUT 2 PEOPLE ON HIS GUEST LIST.
AW, COME ON.
I NEVER GET INCLUDED.
I WANNA BE ON THE LIST,
AND I DON'T WANT ANY LAME EXCUSES.
WELL, THE TRUTH IS, DUE TO THE BUILDING CODES
AND THE WAY THE CHANDELIERS ARE HUNG IN THE BALLROOM,
THEY'RE ONLY ALLOWING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF GUESTS IN
WITH YOUR...
HEIGHT.
WELL, CAN'T GET AROUND SAFETY.
THANKS ANYWAY, BUDDY.
HEY, CHARLIE,
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HEAD OVER TO HOUSE OF NOISE NOW.
IS IT OPEN THIS LATE?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THINGS AT HOUSE OF NOISE
DON'T EVEN GET STARTED TILL 1:00.
CHARLIE, YOU WERE RIGHT.
THIS IS REALLY FUN.
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS...
12 NIGHTS IN A ROW.
I'VE GOT KAMIKAZE SHOTS.
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!
[ Unenthused ] YEAH.
ON THE COUNT OF 3... 1, 2, 3.
AH.
I'M GOING TO GO CROWD SURF.
ALL RIGHT.
INCOMING!
WHOO!
YEAH!
WHOO-HOO!
WHOO!
CHARLIE, THIS IS NOT FUN.
JUST ADMIT YOU'D RATHER BE AT HOME SLEEPING RIGHT NOW.
AND MISS PARTYING WITH MY WOMAN?
NO WAY.
IT'S SO LOUD YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK TO YOUR WOMAN.
SAY THESE WORDS.
"I'D RATHER BE IN BED."
WOULD A GUY WHO'D RATHER BE IN BED DO THIS?
INCOMING!
[ THUD ]
CARTER.
I'M READY TO GO MINGLE WITH THE GAYS.
ANY TIPS FOR ME?
OKAY, TIP NUMBER ONE --
DON'T USE THE TERM "THE GAYS."
SIR, YOU'RE A VERY WITTY AND INTERESTING MAN.
JUST BE YOURSELF.
I'M SURE YOU'LL CHARM THEIR PANTS OFF.
I DON'T WANT THEIR PANTS OFF.
HEY.
SO, YOU MAKING ANY HEADWAY WITH MARTIN?
IT'S GOING WELL, BUT EVERY TIME I GET ON A ROLL,
HIS FRIEND INTERRUPTS.
DO ME A FAVOR.
STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION
WITH THE FRIEND SO HE'S OUT OF MY WAY.
ARE YOU ASKING ME TO BE YOUR GAY WINGMAN?
CAN WE NOT POINT OUT THE DEPTH TO WHICH I'M SINKING?
LOOK, I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
JUST TALK TO THEM LIKE YOU TALK TO ME.
I'M GAY.
YOU'VE LIVED WITH ME FOR SIX YEARS.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY IT.
HI.
I'M STUART.
MARTIN.
SOME TURNOUT, HUH?
OH, YES, WE HAD OVER 200 RSVPs.
WOW.
WHAT DID YOU DO,
TELL THEM YOU WERE GOING TO RAFFLE OFF A PINK MIATA?
[ LAUGHING ]
SO...
YOU'RE HAVING FUN?
A BLAST.
HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU THINK IT'LL BE?
NOT LONG.
THAT'S COOL,
'CAUSE THINGS DON'T EVEN GET STARTED HERE UNTIL 2:00.
TRACY, I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME,
BUT I THINK I'M GOING TO HEAD HOME.
I'M GLAD YOU CAME OUT.
I'M HEADING HOME.
WANT TO SHARE A CAB?
AND MISS HEARING MORE TECHNO REMIXES
OF LAST YEAR'S LATIN HITS?
NOT A CHANCE.
CHARLIE, YOUR LIPS ARE BLUE.
BLUE WITH FUN.
BESIDES, THINGS HERE DON'T EVEN GET STARTED UNTIL 2:00.
YOU HEARD BUNGEE.
FINE.
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.
HEY, CHARLIE.
HEY, PAUL.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I STOOD ON THE WRONG LINE FOR SIX HOURS.
LONG STORY SHORT,
WHO'S UP FOR "LORD OF THE DANCE" NEXT TUESDAY?
HEY, SINCE WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR A WHILE,
WHY DON'T WE SPARK IT UP?
GIVE ME THAT.
RELAX.
CHARLIE, IT'S JUST A JOINT.
YEAH, WELL, IT HAPPENS TO BE A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.
HEY, GUYS, NEWS FLASH --
I'M THE DEPUTY MAYOR.
I CAN'T BE SEEN WITH THIS STUFF.
Man:
YOU THERE WITH THE SIDEBURNS...
PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.
JUST THE OLD GUY.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
HI.
CHARLIE CRAWFORD, DEPUTY MAYOR.
I GO TO VARIOUS NIGHTCLUBS AROUND TOWN
TEACHING KIDS THAT DRUGS ARE BAD.
IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.
LET ME JUST WRAP UP THIS SEMINAR.
KIDS...
DRUGS ARE BAD.
THANKS, MISTER.
WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSON.
HEY, YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF I TOOK A LOOK IN HIS BACKPACK, WOULD YOU?
SURE.
WE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE.
OKAY, PART TWO OF OUR SEMINAR --
INTRODUCTION TO THE INSIDE OF A SQUAD CAR.
THE FIRST LADY SAYS, "YOU'VE SEEN ONE, YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL."
THE SECOND LADY SAYS, "YEAH, BUT THIS ONE'S EATING MY POPCORN."
[ LAUGHING ]
HEY.
IF YOU WERE A "SEX AND THE CITY" CHARACTER,
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU BE?
I'M DEFINITELY MIRANDA.
I'M CHARLOTTE.
I'M SO CARRIE.
AS CARTER WAS TALKING, I HAD TO WONDER --
COULD THESE THREE GUYS BE ANY GAYER?
HEH HEH.
HEY, SIEGFRIED,
I HATE TO TEAR YOU AWAY FROM ROY,
BUT YOU WANT TO SKIP OVER TO THE BAR
AND PICK UP SOMETHING FRUITY, OR MAYBE A DRINK?
I LOVE THIS GUY.
CARTER.
UH...
I WAS, UH,
WAITING FOR THE TWO OF US TO BE ALONE.
I HAD A FEELING.
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU.
THERE'S, UH, SOMETHING I WANT TO ASK YOU, TOO,
BUT YOU FIRST.
OKAY.
UM, IS STUART SEEING ANYONE?
I WOULD LOVE TO.
WHAT?
OH, I'M SORRY.
ARE THE TWO OF YOU AN ITEM?
NO.
IT'S JUST...
HIS HONESTY IS SO REFRESHING.
HE'S DELIGHTFULLY VULGAR.
HE'S UNLIKE ANY GAY MAN I'VE EVER MET.
THAT'S TRUER THAN YOU KNOW.
WOULD YOU LET HIM KNOW I'M INTERESTED,
BE MY WINGMAN?
YEAH.
WHY NOT?
SO, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE MUSICAL?
I HATE MUSICALS.
GOOD ONE, STUEY.
HA HA HA HA HA HA!
HEY, WHO'S THE WINGMAN OF THE YEAR?
YOU IDIOT.
MARTIN WANTS YOU.
HE FINDS YOUR VULGARITY REFRESHING.
FINALLY, SOMEONE GETS ME.
THIS IS SERIOUS.
HE ASKED ME TO COME OVER HERE AND SET YOU UP WITH HIM.
HA HA HA.
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
* HE LIKES ME BETTER THAN YOU *
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
I'LL JUST TELL HIM I'M NOT GAY.
YOU CAN'T TELL HIM YOU'RE STRAIGHT.
THAT WOULD ONLY HUMILIATE HIM.
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
MARTIN HAS THE HOTS FOR STUART.
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY.
LOOK, I'LL JUST LEAVE.
WHOA, NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.
THAT WOULD BE RUDE.
MARTIN DAVIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MAN.
I CAN'T RISK OFFENDING HIM.
SIR, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WELL, I'M SAYING YOU LED HIM ON,
HE FELL FOR YOU, FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK.
MAYBE WE'RE OVERREACTING.
MAYBE HE'S NOT THAT INTO ME.
STUART, I JUST REQUESTED A SLOW SONG.
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR?
OKAY, GUYS, WAKE UP.
I TALKED TO THE POLICE.
THEY'RE GOING TO LET YOU ALL OFF THE HOOK
'CAUSE THIS IS A FIRST-TIME OFFENSE, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE ON YOUR RECORD.
AND YOU -
- YOUR FATHER AND I ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED,
SO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT YOUR FRIENDS,
BECAUSE YOU ARE GROUNDED, MISTER.
I DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT NOW.
LOOK, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,
I COULDN'T HANDLE LAST NIGHT, EITHER,
ESPECIALLY ALL THOSE SHOTS.
THOSE WERE BRUTAL GOING DOWN.
I WAS THROWING THEM OVER MY SHOULDER.
ME TOO.
ARE YOU FINALLY READY TO START ACTING
LIKE A NORMAL GUY YOUR AGE?
NO, BECAUSE I'M NOT A NORMAL GUY.
I'M THE WILD GUY,
THE FUN GUY, THE GUY WHO'S UP FOR ANYTHING.
I'M NOT ACCEPTING THIS.
I AM THE SAME GUY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN,
AND THAT'S NEVER GOING TO CHANGE.
CHARLIE, IT HAS CHANGED.
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT YOU'RE NOT A KID ANYMORE.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
HEY, CHARLIE, IT'S ONLY 5:00.
WE COULD STILL MAKE IT TO JACK'S FOR A ROCK-'N'
-ROLL BREAKFAST.
AT JACK'S, BREAKFAST DOESN'T EVEN START TILL --
STOP SAYING THAT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S STARTED.
TUESDAY, FIVE HOURS AGO.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED TO PARTY.
YES, TRACY, I LIKED TO PARTY.
IN FACT, I PARTIED FOR SO LONG
THAT NOW, I LIKE TO SLEEP.
THE THING IS, I'VE DONE ALL THIS.
I'VE BAR HOPPED, I'VE CROWD SURFED,
I'VE PARTIED ALL NIGHT LONG.
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT A REAL ROCK-'N'
-ROLL BREAKFAST IS?
A SHOT AND AN EGG WITH KEITH RICHARDS.
WHO'S KEITH RICHARDS?
OH, GOD.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M 1,000 YEARS OLD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
OH, ME EITHER.
THEY'RE LIKE A REGULAR FRED ASTAIRE AND...
FRED ASTAIRE.
THE PROBLEM IS, SOONER OR LATER,
MARTIN'S GOING TO FIGURE OUT
THAT STUART'S NOT GAY.
NOT NECESSARILY.
HE CAN STRING HIM ALONG
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS WITHOUT SEX.
WORKED FOR MY EX-WIFE.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I'LL GO OVER THERE AND ASK TO CUT IN,
AND WHEN I'M DANCING WITH MARTIN,
I'LL TURN ON THE OLD HEYWOOD CHARM
AND STEAL THAT MAN AWAY FROM STUART.
AH, THE BEST DAMN PARTY I'VE BEEN TO IN MONTHS.
EXCUSE ME.
MAY I CUT IN?
OKAY.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT YOU CAME TO SAVE ME.
I DID, BY DANCING WITH MARTIN.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT IF I GET MARTIN'S ENGINE RUNNING.
OH, PLEASE.
YOU MIGHT BE GOOD FOR A ONE-NIGHT STAND,
BUT YOU COULD NEVER HOLD ON TO A MAN LIKE THAT.
CARTER, CALM DOWN.
WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO CRAZY ABOUT ONE GUY?
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T MET ANYBODY IN A LONG TIME,
AND WHEN I FINALLY DO, YOU SCREW IT UP.
I'M SORRY.
BUT YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
YOU'RE A CATCH.
OH, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.
OH, HEY, LOOK AT ME.
I COULD GET ANY GUY HERE...
AND I'M DANCING WITH YOU.
I'M SORRY THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR YOU AND TRACY.
THAT'S OKAY.
IT WASN'T GOING TO LAST, ANYWAY.
SHE JUST GOT CAST ON "THE REAL WORLD CHICAGO."
IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.
I GUESS.
WHENEVER WE WENT OUT, TRACY WOULD HAVE A BLAST,
AND I JUST WANTED TO GO HOME AND WATCH "SPORTSCENTER."
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED
IN MY 20 YEARS OF DATING 23-YEAR-OLDS.
YOU KNOW, CHARLIE,
JUST 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY OUT TILL DAWN
DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO HAVE FUN.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULDN'T BE SO HARD ON MYSELF.
I'M BASICALLY THE SAME HIP, COOL GUY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN.
Man:
G-46.
BINGO.
[MAN] SIT, UBU, SIT.
GOOD DOG.
[BARKING]
MOO.
NARRATOR:
Previously on Roswell:
MAX:
Is there a ship?
MICHAEL:
There's a ship.
- Did you do what I told you?
- Yes.
Are you all right, honey?
Honey, are you okay?
Oh, my God.
Michael, you've been staring at that thing for hours.
It's part of a crashed alien ship, Maxwell.
I don't think it makes it any more interesting to watch.
- It could be from our home planet.
- Or not.
Why aren't you taking this thing seriously?
A UFO lands...
It crashed.
I am taking it seriously.
I'm just not obsessing over it.
Obsession isn't always a bad thing.
Maybe there are enemy aliens.
All the more reason to stay away.
Have you been body-snatched or something?
We have no reason to believe the ship was occupied.
Even if it was, the occupants probably died in the crash.
We didn't die in our crash.
What should I do with this thing?
Keep watching.
Make sure it doesn't hatch and release an army of enemy aliens.
I liked you better when you were brooding and paranoid.
Sir.
- Any sign of a door or a cockpit?
- No, sir.
Nothing yet.
Watch your step, sir.
MAN [OVER PA S YSTEM]:
Commencing systems analysis.
We are recording.
- What about a propulsion system?
- Nothing definitive.
I don't know how this thing ever flew.
- Well, it had one, didn't it?
- We haven't found it yet.
Believe me, we're working as fast as we can without damaging it further.
Hey, careful!
We still want to reverse-engineer this thing.
[AIR HISSING]
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
[YELLING]
Four Aliens and a Baby
It's really nice to be close to you again, you know, without...
- Setting something on fire?
- Yeah.
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
See, no green in sight.
We're okay.
You sure this is safe?
Your dad is downstairs...
Yeah, I know.
He's working the grill.
He won't come up.
- You sure?
- Yes.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Where is that phone?
Go away.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
- Just ignore it, okay?
Okay?
- Yeah.
LIZ:
You've got the Parkers, but we're not here.
Leave a message.
DIANE:
Hi.
Liz, it's Diane Evans, Max's mom.
I'm trying to find Max.
It's an emergency.
- That's a buzz-kill.
- Lf you're there, will you...
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Evans.
Um...
Yes, yeah, he's...
He's here.
Hold on one second.
Mom, what's wrong?
A family dinner.
That's the emergency?
What kind of dinner is an emergency?
Can we do this this weekend?
It's just, Liz and I are studying.
[WHISPERING] French, we're studying.
Biology.
Okay, fine.
Ten minutes.
All right, bye.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
Can we continue this after?
My dad will be finished working the grill in a half an hour.
Meet me at Michael's.
It's safer anyway.
- What about Michael?
- I'll get rid of him.
Okay.
ISABEL:
Mom, I don't want to argue, all right.
Is it that big of a deal?
Can't we just...?
Fine.
Fine, I'll come over.
Yes, we'll come over.
Okay, bye.
My mother wants us to go over there for dinner.
- What, tonight?
- Right now.
I'm already eating.
- So stop.
- Isabel.
- What?
- Look, I don't wanna go over there.
- Neither do I, but we're going.
- Go without me.
Jesse, I've already told her that we're both coming.
Can't you pretend that everything is all right between us for one hour?
I pretended for three straight days with your dad, okay?
I've been pretending since I found out what you are.
I'm sick and tired of pretending.
- Welcome to my world.
Okay, this is why I didn't want to drag you into all of this.
- But you did, Isabel, you did!
- Oh, here we go again.
- Let's hear it, Jesse.
- What?
- Expect me to get past this overnight?
- It's been days, Jesse!
It's be...
MAN:
Want me to tag that?
Play it again.
[TAPE REWINDING]
[YELLING PLAYS OVER RECORDER]
That's enough.
- So we lost all 16?
- Yes, sir.
All eyewitnesses are dead.
An automated security camera snapped this as it was leaving.
I want this thing contained.
I want Roswell locked down and searched until this thing is found and destroyed.
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.
- On the way home tonight...
- Yeah, but I...
Stay behind me.
Stay behind me.
Holy sh...
Is that blood?
Yeah, I think so.
[HELICOPTER APPROACHING]
What is going on out there?
So, Mom what's for dinner?
DIANE:
Actually, I'm...
I'm not cooking tonight.
Oh.
Are we ordering in?
We're not actually having dinner.
Your mother and I have something that we wanna share with you all.
DIANE:
Isabel, are you all right, honey?
- Yes, Mom, I'm fine.
Oh, God.
I can't believe you spied on me.
I'm sorry, honey.
But we didn't know what else to do.
Can you please just tell us what this means?
Who are you?
[HELICOPTER HOVERING]
We're your kids.
- Are you?
- Yes.
[CLATTERING]
What was that?
I'll check it out.
Thanks a lot, Max.
TESS:
Max.
Tess?
Please, hold him.
Max, what is it?
It's my son.
Zan.
Where's Zan?
You named the baby Zan?
Well, he is your son and that is your real name.
Where is he?
In the other room, with his very confused grandparents.
Sit down.
I guess it would be too much to ask you to heal this.
Making you feel better isn't one of my priorities.
Okay.
I'm sure you've got a lot on your mind, so let's hear it.
I thought our baby couldn't survive in Earth's atmosphere.
I felt that when I connected with him.
It was a mind warp.
Something I needed you to believe.
I had to do whatever it took to get you to activate the Granilith.
- Including killing Alex?
- That's not what I meant to do.
What was he, collateral damage?
I should kill you right now.
If you kill me, you kill Zan.
What are you talking about?
My son, our son.
We're linked, Max.
Physically.
If I die, so does he.
- I don't believe you.
- Then kill me.
See if I'm lying.
I know you, Max.
You would never take that risk.
You're just gonna have to trust me.
DIANE:
Okay.
PHILIP:
Where do you think Tess has been all this time?
And why do you think she walked into our house now?
Philip.
Do you think Tess is somehow linked to what's going on with Isabel?
Philip.
Shh.
It can wait.
You all right?
Are you kidding?
Max is with Tess.
My parents think I'm some kind of freak.
Look it's going to be okay.
Max can take care of himself, and your parents will love you regardless.
I don't know, Jesse.
Do you?
So, what are you doing here?
Why did you come back?
Kivar betrayed me.
He rejected Zan as the heir and he was gonna kill him so I escaped.
So that was you that crashed the other night.
Yeah, there was an accident.
With the Air Force jet.
It was trying to shoot us down.
I don't know why.
Typical human response, I guess.
My ship was destroyed, and I woke up just as they were about to take Zan.
So, what did you do?
I protected my son.
And how many people did you kill in the process?
I don't know.
- How many?
- I don't remember.
- How many?
- Fifteen, maybe 20.
I didn't stop to count.
I can't believe I ever cared about you.
Well, you did.
And that was not a mind warp.
None of that matters now.
We have to get our son out of Roswell.
Maybe we should try Max again.
Yeah, maybe we should.
[KNOCKING]
Stay here.
- Yeah.
- Good evening.
I'm Major Carlson, United States Air Force.
We've had a security breach out at Rogers Air Force base and the dogs led us here.
Yeah, how about that?
Is that blood on your shoes, sir?
Your dog certainly seems to think so.
We're gonna have to search your house.
Now.
I'm afraid that...
I...
Yeah, I just came home and found it like this.
Blood all over the floor.
Have you seen this woman?
No.
No, the house was empty.
You think this little blond girl did all this?
- Is there anyone else in the house?
- No.
MAN 1:
Sir.
MAN 1:
What is it?
MAN 2:
Try to pick it up outside.
PHILIP:
Isabel about this tape.
Please, Dad, don't make me do this right now.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
I'll get it.
You stay and talk, I'll get it.
- Hello?
- Jesse, Jesse, thank God.
Listen to me.
This is very important.
- There's an alien on the loose.
- Yeah, we know.
It's Tess.
- Tess is back?
- Yes, she's here.
She brought Max's son.
She has the baby?
Are you kidding me?
!
My brain is exploding over here.
These Air Force guys followed her scent to my place.
They'll be there any second.
- What should we do?
- Get the hell out of there.
Look, Kyle, this is actually a really bad time, okay?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Hello, Jesse?
Jesse?
You did not just do that.
Isabel, we don't need a big explanation, I just...
- We don't understand.
- I need to talk to you in the kitchen.
- Now.
- No.
No.
Can't this wait?
It'll just be a minute.
The military's coming for Tess and the baby.
Okay.
I'll tell my parents we have to go.
Tell them what's really going on.
Maybe they could help.
Or turn us in.
- We have to go.
- No.
No.
You're not leaving.
Dad, Mom, listen to me.
There are people coming for Max's baby.
Bad people.
What are you talking about?
[KNOCKING]
CARLSON:
Major Carlson, United States Air Force.
- Open the door.
- No, Dad.
Don't answer that, please.
The United States Air Force?
- Those are the bad people?
- Yes.
They're coming for Max's baby.
CARLSON:
Open the door.
United States Air Force.
Give me the baby.
We have to go now.
What is going on here?
Max's baby is an...
Is an alien.
- He's a what?
- So am I.
That's how I was able to do those things on that tape.
CARLSON:
Open the door.
MAX:
It's true.
We're different.
But we're still your children.
- Help us, please.
CARLSON:
Open the door or we'll be forced to break it down.
ISABEL:
Dad.
We're here to search your home, sir.
- You'll need to step aside.
- Sorry.
I can't let you.
CARLSON:
I'm not asking permission.
PHILIP:
Military has no jurisdiction here.
- Step aside, sir.
- Can you produce a search warrant?
CARLSON:
Sergeant.
- Tess, you are not here.
- Michael, no.
- Maxwell, get out of the way.
- Not until you calm down.
- Whatever she told you, she's lying.
- She has my son.
- Well, get the baby out of the way.
- No.
He needs her.
If you kill her, my son will die.
Max, what the hell is she doing here?
It's a long story.
We need to get them out of Roswell.
- Yeah, my heart bleeds.
- Nice to see you too, Michael.
Hey, don't start.
So you crashed in the desert the other night?
You always were the quick one, Guerin.
[ELECTRICITY PULSATING]
Get up, bitch.
I'll kill you.
MAX:
Liz, no!
No, Liz, no.
- You're a murderer!
I'll kill you!
Welcome back.
Let go, wait.
What, what...?
So you trust her now?
No, Liz, far from it.
Tess and my son are linked.
Killing her would kill him.
- Yeah, it's convenient.
- Liz, I have no other choice.
- I have to believe her.
- This is insane.
She betrayed all of us.
She killed Alex.
- I know.
- No, she has to pay for it.
Max, promise me, when this is all over, Tess will pay for what she did.
I promise.
Let me know when it's over.
Hey, Liz, is everything okay?
Guess not.
Kyle, thank God you're here.
- Don't come near me.
TESS:
Kyle give me a chance to explain.
- Why haven't you killed her yet?
- Max wouldn't let me.
Come on, Zan.
I don't want you to see this.
Be careful with him, Max.
- So, what are you doing here?
- Ask one of them.
- I'm sick of explaining.
KYLE:
Explain what you were doing in our house earlier.
I thought you'd help me.
- Why run away in such a hurry?
TESS:
I was protecting my son.
- He wasn't in danger.
- Your father had a gun.
Instincts took over.
You're lucky I didn't kill you.
Yeah, I guess I owe you one.
Oh, actually, no.
- Kyle.
- We took you into our home, Tess.
We protected you.
And how did you repay us?
Brainwashed me into carrying Alex's dead body.
- I never meant to hurt...
- Well, too late!
TESS:
You've never even heard my side of the story.
You have a side?
The murderer has a side.
I was raised by a killer, Kyle.
- A sick and twisted man.
- Don't try to play the victim here, Tess.
You know, of all the aliens I've met, you're the only one who has no soul.
This doesn't make any sense, Isabel.
- You don't look any different.
- I'm half-human.
- And the other half?
- Mom, please, not now.
How long have you known?
About a month.
- And you're okay with it?
JESSE:
I'm trying.
She's still the woman I fell in love with.
She's still Isabel.
LIZ:
I blasted Tess and she went flying.
Wait a minute, back up a second.
You blasted her?
I thought your power flare-ups were over?
Yeah, me too.
But I saw her, and all of this energy just came out of me.
I mean, all of this, like, anger, and hatred.
I thought that part of my life was dead and buried.
Wait a minute, no.
That part was never dead and buried.
- You've never truly gotten over that.
- Okay.
I just want Tess out of my life.
Well, it's easy enough.
Walk over to one of those men over there and tell them where she's hiding.
- No, I...
I can't do that.
- Fine, I'll do it.
No, sit down.
- What?
- I'm just...
I'm so sick of seeing my best friend like this.
- Like what?
- Like a victim.
You don't have to be a victim.
Forgive Max, or get him out of your life.
It's one or the other.
You have to make a decision.
It's your decision.
It's your life.
An Air Force truck filled with three tons of explosives was stolen this evening.
The military has checkpoints on every road out of Roswell...
- Nice cover story.
- We're screwed.
MAX:
No, we're not.
- What do you got?
I don't know, yet.
[HELICOPTER HOVERING]
Maxwell, we're screwed.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
Hello.
What?
That was Isabel.
They found the baby's blankets, the dogs picked up scent.
- They'll be here in no time.
- We gotta go, now.
I'm getting Zan.
Hey, you're not the one calling the shots around here.
But, Maxwell, she's right.
We gotta get out of here.
- Do you have energy to mind-warp?
- I think so.
Okay, great.
I'll grab the car.
- Michael, have you got any milk?
- Just Snapple.
Great.
Can't you breast-feed?
Here they come.
Get ready.
Have either of you seen this woman?
- Mm-mmm.
- I haven't seen her.
[BARKING]
Can I have you open your trunk, sir?
Sure.
All right.
You guys are clear to go through.
[ZAN COOING]
Shh!
[ZAN CRYING]
M. P:
Hold it.
Hold it right there!
Get out of the car.
Now!
- I'm sorry.
I couldn't hold it.
- Maxwell!
Go.
Go.
Go!
Get down!
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, just get out of here!
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
- Hello?
- They didn't make it.
- What happened?
- They got turned back.
We need to meet at your apartment.
It's the only safe place left.
Okay, I'll be there.
- Are Max and the baby okay?
- For now.
We've gotta go.
DIANE:
Isabel.
Honey, please be careful.
Philip.
Zan's asleep.
- We're running out of time, Max.
- We need a Plan B.
Go.
Go without me.
Just get Zan to safety.
You said he couldn't survive without you.
Another lie?
- I knew it.
- You were going to kill me.
I was just trying to stay alive to keep our son safe.
Now the only way to keep him safe is to let him go.
So the baby's not linked to you at all?
- No.
Zan is completely human.
What?
That's why they rejected him on Antar.
That's why I had to come back.
- How is that possible?
LIZ:
It's genetics, Max.
She's half-human.
You're half-human.
You both have the DNA.
It makes sense.
Wait, let me get this straight:
If the baby doesn't need you, then we can kill you.
- Michael.
ISABEL:
We could.
But the Air Force would still be looking for an alien looking for us.
If the Air Force wants an alien, why don't we give them one.
ISABEL:
Turn her in?
MARIA:
Yeah.
They won't be looking for an alien and they'll leave us alone.
I'm sensing a Plan B.
No.
They'd study her like a lab rat for the rest of her life.
I've been there.
And I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
Max, this isn't a decision that you get to make.
- It affects all three of us.
MARIA:
Oh, no.
This is not an alien decision only.
She killed Alex.
She killed my best friend.
I think that we should all get to vote.
All right, fair enough.
Let's put it to a vote.
Yes, we turn her in.
No, we try to help her.
I say yes, turn her in.
We shouldn't be doing this.
I vote no.
I trusted you.
And Alex...
I vote yes.
I vote no.
Michael?
Do it.
Turn her in.
MAX:
Jesse, what do you say?
I never met her or Alex.
I shouldn't get a vote.
Fair enough.
Kyle?
I don't know.
No, I can't do it.
MARIA:
All right, Liz, cast your vote, break the tie.
- I vote no.
MARIA:
What?
Are you crazy?
I made my vote.
So, what are we gonna do?
Wait.
Pray they don't find us.
[HELICOPTER HOVERING]
Liz, wake up.
What?
- Why didn't you vote against me?
- Because I'm not a killer, Tess.
I need a favor.
I need you to drive me somewhere.
Max loves you.
Every time we were together every time we kissed, he was thinking of you.
He had these flashes that I saw and they were always of you.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I know how much it must have hurt you.
So you're really gonna go do this, huh?
At least I can do one good thing with my life.
You just did.
Hey, Tess you're not gonna let them throw you in the white room, are you?
No.
[MEN SHOUTING]
[GUNFIRE] [ALARMS SOUNDING]
[EXPLOSION]
[ZAN CRYING]
Don't you think you should get some sleep?
Didn't I tell you?
Aliens don't need sleep.
You don't have to watch him every second.
It's hard to tear myself away.
I know how you feel.
That's how I felt when we first adopted you and Isabel.
The love you feel for him, Max that's how your mother and I feel about you.
No matter what.
They're out there, Dad.
I know it.
I can feel it.
They're coming for him.
No one's coming for him, Max.
Your son is safe here.
It's been over for days.
- It'll never be over.
- Max.
I've been living with this a lot longer than you have.
It's a constant battle.
Your mother and I have been a part of that battle, haven't we?
Well I'm sorry.
- But we can help you fight them now.
- We have been fighting them.
And if not these guys, it'll be someone else.
I just want my son to live a normal life away from all of this.
He will live a normal life, Max.
- He will.
- Not if I'm a part of it.
What are you saying?
He's human.
He deserves to live a normal human life.
Look, all I've wanted for the past year, more than anything else in my life was to find him.
And now that I finally have I think that I'm gonna have to give him up.
- Max.
- I'm a marked man and so are you.
Maybe if things were different maybe in the future there will be a way but right now, I have to ensure Zan's safety.
And the only way to do that is to get him away from me from us.
Can you help me?
Are you sure about this?
I have an old law-school buddy who handles things like this.
He's in New York, though.
The further away, the better.
The less I know about where Zan's going to end up, the safer he'll be.
Just promise me you'll put him with a good family.
I want him to have parents like...
Well, just like you and Mom.
Can you make sure he gets that?
Yeah I can do that.
Max.
It's...
It's time.
What was that?
Just a memory.
I'm here.
I'll always be here.

NARRATOR:
Previously on Roswell:
MAX:
Is there a ship?
MICHAEL:
There's a ship.
- Did you do what I told you?
- Yes.
Are you all right, honey?
Honey, are you okay?
Oh, my God.
Michael, you've been staring at that thing for hours.
It's part of a crashed alien ship, Maxwell.
I don't think it makes it any more interesting to watch.
- It could be from our home planet.
- Or not.
Why aren't you taking this thing seriously?
A UFO lands...
It crashed.
I am taking it seriously.
I'm just not obsessing over it.
Obsession isn't always a bad thing.
Maybe there are enemy aliens.
All the more reason to stay away.
Have you been body-snatched or something?
We have no reason to believe the ship was occupied.
Even if it was, the occupants probably died in the crash.
We didn't die in our crash.
What should I do with this thing?
Keep watching.
Make sure it doesn't hatch and release an army of enemy aliens.
I liked you better when you were brooding and paranoid.
Sir.
- Any sign of a door or a cockpit?
- No, sir.
Nothing yet.
Watch your step, sir.
MAN [OVER PA S YSTEM]:
Commencing systems analysis.
We are recording.
- What about a propulsion system?
- Nothing definitive.
I don't know how this thing ever flew.
- Well, it had one, didn't it?
- We haven't found it yet.
Believe me, we're working as fast as we can without damaging it further.
Hey, careful!
We still want to reverse-engineer this thing.
[AIR HISSING]
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
[YELLING]
Four Aliens and a Baby
It's really nice to be close to you again, you know, without...
- Setting something on fire?
- Yeah.
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
See, no green in sight.
We're okay.
You sure this is safe?
Your dad is downstairs...
Yeah, I know.
He's working the grill.
He won't come up.
- You sure?
- Yes.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Where is that phone?
Go away.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
- Just ignore it, okay?
Okay?
- Yeah.
LIZ:
You've got the Parkers, but we're not here.
Leave a message.
DIANE:
Hi.
Liz, it's Diane Evans, Max's mom.
I'm trying to find Max.
It's an emergency.
- That's a buzz-kill.
- Lf you're there, will you...
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Evans.
Um...
Yes, yeah, he's...
He's here.
Hold on one second.
Mom, what's wrong?
A family dinner.
That's the emergency?
What kind of dinner is an emergency?
Can we do this this weekend?
It's just, Liz and I are studying.
[WHISPERING] French, we're studying.
Biology.
Okay, fine.
Ten minutes.
All right, bye.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
Can we continue this after?
My dad will be finished working the grill in a half an hour.
Meet me at Michael's.
It's safer anyway.
- What about Michael?
- I'll get rid of him.
Okay.
ISABEL:
Mom, I don't want to argue, all right.
Is it that big of a deal?
Can't we just...?
Fine.
Fine, I'll come over.
Yes, we'll come over.
Okay, bye.
My mother wants us to go over there for dinner.
- What, tonight?
- Right now.
I'm already eating.
- So stop.
- Isabel.
- What?
- Look, I don't wanna go over there.
- Neither do I, but we're going.
- Go without me.
Jesse, I've already told her that we're both coming.
Can't you pretend that everything is all right between us for one hour?
I pretended for three straight days with your dad, okay?
I've been pretending since I found out what you are.
I'm sick and tired of pretending.
- Welcome to my world.
Okay, this is why I didn't want to drag you into all of this.
- But you did, Isabel, you did!
- Oh, here we go again.
- Let's hear it, Jesse.
- What?
- Expect me to get past this overnight?
- It's been days, Jesse!
It's be...
MAN:
Want me to tag that?
Play it again.
[TAPE REWINDING]
[YELLING PLAYS OVER RECORDER]
That's enough.
- So we lost all 16?
- Yes, sir.
All eyewitnesses are dead.
An automated security camera snapped this as it was leaving.
I want this thing contained.
I want Roswell locked down and searched until this thing is found and destroyed.
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.
- On the way home tonight...
- Yeah, but I...
Stay behind me.
Stay behind me.
Holy sh...
Is that blood?
Yeah, I think so.
[HELICOPTER APPROACHING]
What is going on out there?
So, Mom what's for dinner?
DIANE:
Actually, I'm...
I'm not cooking tonight.
Oh.
Are we ordering in?
We're not actually having dinner.
Your mother and I have something that we wanna share with you all.
DIANE:
Isabel, are you all right, honey?
- Yes, Mom, I'm fine.
Oh, God.
I can't believe you spied on me.
I'm sorry, honey.
But we didn't know what else to do.
Can you please just tell us what this means?
Who are you?
[HELICOPTER HOVERING]
We're your kids.
- Are you?
- Yes.
[CLATTERING]
What was that?
I'll check it out.
Thanks a lot, Max.
TESS:
Max.
Tess?
Please, hold him.
Max, what is it?
It's my son.
Zan.
Where's Zan?
You named the baby Zan?
Well, he is your son and that is your real name.
Where is he?
In the other room, with his very confused grandparents.
Sit down.
I guess it would be too much to ask you to heal this.
Making you feel better isn't one of my priorities.
Okay.
I'm sure you've got a lot on your mind, so let's hear it.
I thought our baby couldn't survive in Earth's atmosphere.
I felt that when I connected with him.
It was a mind warp.
Something I needed you to believe.
I had to do whatever it took to get you to activate the Granilith.
- Including killing Alex?
- That's not what I meant to do.
What was he, collateral damage?
I should kill you right now.
If you kill me, you kill Zan.
What are you talking about?
My son, our son.
We're linked, Max.
Physically.
If I die, so does he.
- I don't believe you.
- Then kill me.
See if I'm lying.
I know you, Max.
You would never take that risk.
You're just gonna have to trust me.
DIANE:
Okay.
PHILIP:
Where do you think Tess has been all this time?
And why do you think she walked into our house now?
Philip.
Do you think Tess is somehow linked to what's going on with Isabel?
Philip.
Shh.
It can wait.
You all right?
Are you kidding?
Max is with Tess.
My parents think I'm some kind of freak.
Look it's going to be okay.
Max can take care of himself, and your parents will love you regardless.
I don't know, Jesse.
Do you?
So, what are you doing here?
Why did you come back?
Kivar betrayed me.
He rejected Zan as the heir and he was gonna kill him so I escaped.
So that was you that crashed the other night.
Yeah, there was an accident.
With the Air Force jet.
It was trying to shoot us down.
I don't know why.
Typical human response, I guess.
My ship was destroyed, and I woke up just as they were about to take Zan.
So, what did you do?
I protected my son.
And how many people did you kill in the process?
I don't know.
- How many?
- I don't remember.
- How many?
- Fifteen, maybe 20.
I didn't stop to count.
I can't believe I ever cared about you.
Well, you did.
And that was not a mind warp.
None of that matters now.
We have to get our son out of Roswell.
Maybe we should try Max again.
Yeah, maybe we should.
[KNOCKING]
Stay here.
- Yeah.
- Good evening.
I'm Major Carlson, United States Air Force.
We've had a security breach out at Rogers Air Force base and the dogs led us here.
Yeah, how about that?
Is that blood on your shoes, sir?
Your dog certainly seems to think so.
We're gonna have to search your house.
Now.
I'm afraid that...
I...
Yeah, I just came home and found it like this.
Blood all over the floor.
Have you seen this woman?
No.
No, the house was empty.
You think this little blond girl did all this?
- Is there anyone else in the house?
- No.
MAN 1:
Sir.
MAN 1:
What is it?
MAN 2:
Try to pick it up outside.
PHILIP:
Isabel about this tape.
Please, Dad, don't make me do this right now.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
I'll get it.
You stay and talk, I'll get it.
- Hello?
- Jesse, Jesse, thank God.
Listen to me.
This is very important.
- There's an alien on the loose.
- Yeah, we know.
It's Tess.
- Tess is back?
- Yes, she's here.
She brought Max's son.
She has the baby?
Are you kidding me?
!
My brain is exploding over here.
These Air Force guys followed her scent to my place.
They'll be there any second.
- What should we do?
- Get the hell out of there.
Look, Kyle, this is actually a really bad time, okay?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Hello, Jesse?
Jesse?
You did not just do that.
Isabel, we don't need a big explanation, I just...
- We don't understand.
- I need to talk to you in the kitchen.
- Now.
- No.
No.
Can't this wait?
It'll just be a minute.
The military's coming for Tess and the baby.
Okay.
I'll tell my parents we have to go.
Tell them what's really going on.
Maybe they could help.
Or turn us in.
- We have to go.
- No.
No.
You're not leaving.
Dad, Mom, listen to me.
There are people coming for Max's baby.
Bad people.
What are you talking about?
[KNOCKING]
CARLSON:
Major Carlson, United States Air Force.
- Open the door.
- No, Dad.
Don't answer that, please.
The United States Air Force?
- Those are the bad people?
- Yes.
They're coming for Max's baby.
CARLSON:
Open the door.
United States Air Force.
Give me the baby.
We have to go now.
What is going on here?
Max's baby is an...
Is an alien.
- He's a what?
- So am I.
That's how I was able to do those things on that tape.
CARLSON:
Open the door.
MAX:
It's true.
We're different.
But we're still your children.
- Help us, please.
CARLSON:
Open the door or we'll be forced to break it down.
ISABEL:
Dad.
We're here to search your home, sir.
- You'll need to step aside.
- Sorry.
I can't let you.
CARLSON:
I'm not asking permission.
PHILIP:
Military has no jurisdiction here.
- Step aside, sir.
- Can you produce a search warrant?
CARLSON:
Sergeant.
- Tess, you are not here.
- Michael, no.
- Maxwell, get out of the way.
- Not until you calm down.
- Whatever she told you, she's lying.
- She has my son.
- Well, get the baby out of the way.
- No.
He needs her.
If you kill her, my son will die.
Max, what the hell is she doing here?
It's a long story.
We need to get them out of Roswell.
- Yeah, my heart bleeds.
- Nice to see you too, Michael.
Hey, don't start.
So you crashed in the desert the other night?
You always were the quick one, Guerin.
[ELECTRICITY PULSATING]
Get up, bitch.
I'll kill you.
MAX:
Liz, no!
No, Liz, no.
- You're a murderer!
I'll kill you!
Welcome back.
Let go, wait.
What, what...?
So you trust her now?
No, Liz, far from it.
Tess and my son are linked.
Killing her would kill him.
- Yeah, it's convenient.
- Liz, I have no other choice.
- I have to believe her.
- This is insane.
She betrayed all of us.
She killed Alex.
- I know.
- No, she has to pay for it.
Max, promise me, when this is all over, Tess will pay for what she did.
I promise.
Let me know when it's over.
Hey, Liz, is everything okay?
Guess not.
Kyle, thank God you're here.
- Don't come near me.
TESS:
Kyle give me a chance to explain.
- Why haven't you killed her yet?
- Max wouldn't let me.
Come on, Zan.
I don't want you to see this.
Be careful with him, Max.
- So, what are you doing here?
- Ask one of them.
- I'm sick of explaining.
KYLE:
Explain what you were doing in our house earlier.
I thought you'd help me.
- Why run away in such a hurry?
TESS:
I was protecting my son.
- He wasn't in danger.
- Your father had a gun.
Instincts took over.
You're lucky I didn't kill you.
Yeah, I guess I owe you one.
Oh, actually, no.
- Kyle.
- We took you into our home, Tess.
We protected you.
And how did you repay us?
Brainwashed me into carrying Alex's dead body.
- I never meant to hurt...
- Well, too late!
TESS:
You've never even heard my side of the story.
You have a side?
The murderer has a side.
I was raised by a killer, Kyle.
- A sick and twisted man.
- Don't try to play the victim here, Tess.
You know, of all the aliens I've met, you're the only one who has no soul.
This doesn't make any sense, Isabel.
- You don't look any different.
- I'm half-human.
- And the other half?
- Mom, please, not now.
How long have you known?
About a month.
- And you're okay with it?
JESSE:
I'm trying.
She's still the woman I fell in love with.
She's still Isabel.
LIZ:
I blasted Tess and she went flying.
Wait a minute, back up a second.
You blasted her?
I thought your power flare-ups were over?
Yeah, me too.
But I saw her, and all of this energy just came out of me.
I mean, all of this, like, anger, and hatred.
I thought that part of my life was dead and buried.
Wait a minute, no.
That part was never dead and buried.
- You've never truly gotten over that.
- Okay.
I just want Tess out of my life.
Well, it's easy enough.
Walk over to one of those men over there and tell them where she's hiding.
- No, I...
I can't do that.
- Fine, I'll do it.
No, sit down.
- What?
- I'm just...
I'm so sick of seeing my best friend like this.
- Like what?
- Like a victim.
You don't have to be a victim.
Forgive Max, or get him out of your life.
It's one or the other.
You have to make a decision.
It's your decision.
It's your life.
An Air Force truck filled with three tons of explosives was stolen this evening.
The military has checkpoints on every road out of Roswell...
- Nice cover story.
- We're screwed.
MAX:
No, we're not.
- What do you got?
I don't know, yet.
[HELICOPTER HOVERING]
Maxwell, we're screwed.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
Hello.
What?
That was Isabel.
They found the baby's blankets, the dogs picked up scent.
- They'll be here in no time.
- We gotta go, now.
I'm getting Zan.
Hey, you're not the one calling the shots around here.
But, Maxwell, she's right.
We gotta get out of here.
- Do you have energy to mind-warp?
- I think so.
Okay, great.
I'll grab the car.
- Michael, have you got any milk?
- Just Snapple.
Great.
Can't you breast-feed?
Here they come.
Get ready.
Have either of you seen this woman?
- Mm-mmm.
- I haven't seen her.
[BARKING]
Can I have you open your trunk, sir?
Sure.
All right.
You guys are clear to go through.
[ZAN COOING]
Shh!
[ZAN CRYING]
M. P:
Hold it.
Hold it right there!
Get out of the car.
Now!
- I'm sorry.
I couldn't hold it.
- Maxwell!
Go.
Go.
Go!
Get down!
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, just get out of here!
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
- Hello?
- They didn't make it.
- What happened?
- They got turned back.
We need to meet at your apartment.
It's the only safe place left.
Okay, I'll be there.
- Are Max and the baby okay?
- For now.
We've gotta go.
DIANE:
Isabel.
Honey, please be careful.
Philip.
Zan's asleep.
- We're running out of time, Max.
- We need a Plan B.
Go.
Go without me.
Just get Zan to safety.
You said he couldn't survive without you.
Another lie?
- I knew it.
- You were going to kill me.
I was just trying to stay alive to keep our son safe.
Now the only way to keep him safe is to let him go.
So the baby's not linked to you at all?
- No.
Zan is completely human.
What?
That's why they rejected him on Antar.
That's why I had to come back.
- How is that possible?
LIZ:
It's genetics, Max.
She's half-human.
You're half-human.
You both have the DNA.
It makes sense.
Wait, let me get this straight:
If the baby doesn't need you, then we can kill you.
- Michael.
ISABEL:
We could.
But the Air Force would still be looking for an alien looking for us.
If the Air Force wants an alien, why don't we give them one.
ISABEL:
Turn her in?
MARIA:
Yeah.
They won't be looking for an alien and they'll leave us alone.
I'm sensing a Plan B.
No.
They'd study her like a lab rat for the rest of her life.
I've been there.
And I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
Max, this isn't a decision that you get to make.
- It affects all three of us.
MARIA:
Oh, no.
This is not an alien decision only.
She killed Alex.
She killed my best friend.
I think that we should all get to vote.
All right, fair enough.
Let's put it to a vote.
Yes, we turn her in.
No, we try to help her.
I say yes, turn her in.
We shouldn't be doing this.
I vote no.
I trusted you.
And Alex...
I vote yes.
I vote no.
Michael?
Do it.
Turn her in.
MAX:
Jesse, what do you say?
I never met her or Alex.
I shouldn't get a vote.
Fair enough.
Kyle?
I don't know.
No, I can't do it.
MARIA:
All right, Liz, cast your vote, break the tie.
- I vote no.
MARIA:
What?
Are you crazy?
I made my vote.
So, what are we gonna do?
Wait.
Pray they don't find us.
[HELICOPTER HOVERING]
Liz, wake up.
What?
- Why didn't you vote against me?
- Because I'm not a killer, Tess.
I need a favor.
I need you to drive me somewhere.
Max loves you.
Every time we were together every time we kissed, he was thinking of you.
He had these flashes that I saw and they were always of you.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I know how much it must have hurt you.
So you're really gonna go do this, huh?
At least I can do one good thing with my life.
You just did.
Hey, Tess you're not gonna let them throw you in the white room, are you?
No.
[MEN SHOUTING]
[GUNFIRE] [ALARMS SOUNDING]
[EXPLOSION]
[ZAN CRYING]
Don't you think you should get some sleep?
Didn't I tell you?
Aliens don't need sleep.
You don't have to watch him every second.
It's hard to tear myself away.
I know how you feel.
That's how I felt when we first adopted you and Isabel.
The love you feel for him, Max that's how your mother and I feel about you.
No matter what.
They're out there, Dad.
I know it.
I can feel it.
They're coming for him.
No one's coming for him, Max.
Your son is safe here.
It's been over for days.
- It'll never be over.
- Max.
I've been living with this a lot longer than you have.
It's a constant battle.
Your mother and I have been a part of that battle, haven't we?
Well I'm sorry.
- But we can help you fight them now.
- We have been fighting them.
And if not these guys, it'll be someone else.
I just want my son to live a normal life away from all of this.
He will live a normal life, Max.
- He will.
- Not if I'm a part of it.
What are you saying?
He's human.
He deserves to live a normal human life.
Look, all I've wanted for the past year, more than anything else in my life was to find him.
And now that I finally have I think that I'm gonna have to give him up.
- Max.
- I'm a marked man and so are you.
Maybe if things were different maybe in the future there will be a way but right now, I have to ensure Zan's safety.
And the only way to do that is to get him away from me from us.
Can you help me?
Are you sure about this?
I have an old law-school buddy who handles things like this.
He's in New York, though.
The further away, the better.
The less I know about where Zan's going to end up, the safer he'll be.
Just promise me you'll put him with a good family.
I want him to have parents like...
Well, just like you and Mom.
Can you make sure he gets that?
Yeah I can do that.
Max.
It's...
It's time.
What was that?
Just a memory.
I'm here.
I'll always be here.

THE COAST GUARD
The Korean peninsula is the only divided country on earth
After the Korean War, South Korea's coastline have been surrounded by barbed wire fences to block any attack
Even now, whoever enters the coast after sunset, can be considered a spy and be killed
- Five minutes until roll call!
- Five minutes until roll call!
Get your asses moving now!
- Quickly!
- Yes, sir.
1st Private Kim.
Put it on my eyes.
Please stop.
I'm sick of it.
We'll see.
Whether I catch one or not.
We'll see what, you moron?
Think a spy will come to you?
Hurry it up!
- Take center!
- Taking center!
- Count to the right!
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
- Salute.
- Salute.
Coast Guard platoon, 23 reporting and one on duty.
All 23 ready for night watch, sir!
- At ease.
- Yes, sir.
At ease!
Our country faces the sea at three sides, and all coasts are restricted.
This zone especially was intruded by spies three times since the war.
Never let your guards down here.
You'll be commemorated for killing a spy, and be specially discharged.
You'll be honored for the rest of your life.
But if you miss one, you'll bring disgrace to your life forever.
Spies are unlike before.
They'll avoid being seen, and either shoot a poisoned dart or slice your neck off.
Hey, idiot.
Are you with special forces?
Get training from them?
!
If you'd like, I can do it, sir.
Want a bullet through your head?
Where's your helmet?
Before a spy shoots, I'll shoot first, sir.
Sure.
We'll see about that.
That is all.
About-face!
Raise your arms.
- March.
- March.
Coffee's here, honey.
- It's a card game.
- Get over here.
- Who's winning?
- He is.
The pot's mine now.
- I won!
- Shit!
Are you two cheating?
Get away from my sister.
- What are you looking at?
- Who's looking?
- Who cares if he does.
Honey, look at me, too.
- Yeah, army bastards never get laid.
- You low-life punks.
- Go.
Forget about them.
Spies don't exist anymore, damn it.
All you pigs do is play, and freeload off our taxes.
Cowards can't even shoot an empty gun.
Empty gun?
I see.
If you're brave, come and find out.
Fuck, you'll be in pieces.
After my grenade tears you apart.
You asshole!
You fucking assholes!
Don't!
- Dammit.
- None your bussiness
Stop it!
Stop it!
Fucking assholes!
I dare you to come to the coast at night.
I'll shoot you all even if you're not a spy.
Just go.
Think that bastard could shoot a spy for real?
If you test him out, I'll give you my sister.
Really?
Do it Young-gil.
- He'll give you Mee-young.
- Only if you come out alive.
- Duk-bae, heard that?
- Sure did.
You're crazy.
He said he'll definitely shoot.
Don't kid around.
- Saw her worry about me, right?
- Did you two already screw behind my back?
!
Shit!
Bunch of punks who didn't even serve.
Forget about it.
They're always like that.
Fucking assholes.
They better not cross my path.
Guard post 26.
All is clear.
Check a strange object at 500 meters ten o'clock.
I don't see anything.
It's a fishing tube, over.
Think we'll see a spy before we get discharged?
Do we really have to catch one?
Then why are we here?
I just hope nothing happens before I get discharged.
I'll lie in ambush over there.
A spy might come in there.
Platoon leader will get pissed.
Platoon.
- Night.

Training for a surprise attack.

Get up, you bastard.
- I'll hit for real.
- Then do it!
- Don't regret it.
- Hit me, idiot!
I told you not to fight.
Please stop.
Are you okay, sir?
Fight me!
Fight me, you bastard!
You're next.

Anyway, no way.
Got it?

Just follow me if you like me.
WARNING
Bastards can't even shoot a fish.
Okay.
I'm a spy, so shoot.
Shoot, you bastards.
Mee-young.
Why do you look so pretty today?
Let's hug, and stop teasing me.
- Do you love me?
- Of course.
What are you doing?
Get out of there.
Come over here.
If you do, I'll hug you.
Are you crazy?
Stop kidding around, and come out.
Remember the old lady who got shot last year?
Bastards got commended and went on leave.
So you don't love me?
Are you crazy?
Stop playing, and come out now.
They shoot at night no matter what.
- Scared you might get shot?
- Aren't you scared?
I heard they shoot to get discharged.
Now you're all mine.
It feels great.
Is it a spy?
Young-gil...
Over here!
- What is it?
- Check!
Don't touch it!
I caught that spy!
Hurry and check now!
- Don't come any closer!
- Bastard.
Looks like one of those punks.
- This is the killed civilian, sir.
- Who's the soldier that did it?
1st Private Kang Han-chul sitting over there.
My Young-gil!
Get out of my way!
- Didn't he look drunk to you?
- I don't know.
- Weren't you scared?
- I don't know.
Mee-young, are you okay?
Why'd you get drunk and go in there?
Take a rest.
Good work.
Why'd you go in knowing you could get shot?
She seems a bit strange.
Who killed my son?
You murderer.
Is it you?
You murderer!
Bring my son back!
Bring my son back!
Bring my son back.
- You rotten bastard.
You rotten bastard.
- Take her away!
Bring my son back.
Hey shithead!
Is Young-gil a spy?
Can a soldier shoot anyone?
Move back and be quiet.
How can I be quiet after a civilian was killed?
You murderers!
I told you not to come in here.
This is a military zone.
Cut the crap, and give me that murderer!
Think I can't kill someone without a gun?
The soldier did nothing wrong.
He just carried out his duty!
And if he was a spy, who response to that
You son of a bitch!
Take them out!
Hands-up.
Don't move
Hurry up!
If you make a trouble
- Salute.

Mee-young.
Mee-young!
What the hell's wrong with you?
- Cheers!
- Congratulations.
Is it a special or regular leave?
What are you on leave for?
What's wrong with you?
On leave, you always talked all night about soldier stories.
- That's my drink.
- Drink a little.
Hey, did you catch a spy?
Or kill a drunk civilian who crossed the line?
Heard they give you a break if you do.
What's wrong with you?
Hey!
Why'd you act that way?
Something happen at the base?
Your hand.
What's wrong with you?
Was it true what Hyung-shik said?
What's wrong with you?
Please say something.
Give me the ball.

Why are you doing this?
I'm sorry.
Talk to me!

What are you gonna do?
You murdering son of a bitch!
What are you gonna do about my crazy sister?
Come here, you bastard.
Young-gil.

Are you alright?
It must hurt a lot.
Rotten bastards went too far.
Are you okay?
Hurry it up.
Work faster by the fence.
Hurry it up!
Private Kang, sir.
How did it feel at that time?
You know, when you shot that drunk guy.
Besides a war, when could you ever shoot someone?
Did you pull the trigger right as you saw him?
But you emptied a whole magazine.
If it were me, I couldn't have fired.
I heard soldiers who went to Vietnam liked it later.
They shot at whatever they wanted.
- What's with you, Private Kang?
- Let go!
I'm sorry, Private Cho.
Stop doing that, you're making me nervous.
Something happen with Sun-hwa on break?
Where are you going?
- Seoul.
- What?
Hey, Private Kang!
Who is it?
Who is it?
You bastard.
Hurry up!
Go!
Hey!
Private Kang!
Pull over!
Are you crazy?
Know what you're doing now?
Want to ruin your life?
His mental state is unstable, so he looks unfit for duty.
- Platoon leader.
- Yes, sir.
- Don't give him a gun.
- I understand, sir.
- Salute.
- Salute.
Reporting, sir.
1st Private Kang Han-chul here to report that I am unfit for duty, so on June 15, 2002, I am hereby ordered to be discharged from my service.
Salute.
Take care, Private Kang.
Salute!
- It's so pretty.
- I'm glad we came here.
- It's so pretty.
- Let's go in here.
- Hey, we're not supposed to go in there.
- Who cares?
Let's just take one picture.
- You're uncontrollable.
- Be careful.
- I told you to wear pants.
- Who cares?
- It's glass.
- What is this?
Be careful.
I'll take it.
I'm taking it.
Smile.
One, two, three.
Miss, you can't take pictures here.
- I know, but the scenery is so pretty.
- And we came all the way from Seoul.
- Then take just one picture.
- Take it with both of us.
Here I go.
- Smile.
One, two...
- Wait.
I'm taking it.
One, Two...
- Anyway, who put that glass there?
- It's for the spies.
- But I got cut.
- Glass shouldn't be there.
- Private Kim!
- Sir, everything is clear!
Clear?
Who told these girls to come in here and take pictures?
Ladies, this is a restricted zone.
No pictures here.
We're not spies.
What are you doing?
- We have other pictures, you know.
- Be grateful we're not arresting you.
You careless bastard.
Wanna go to detention?
Do your duty right!
Stop coming back here.
Get out of there.
Give me the gun!
Young-gil.
Young-gil.
Young-gil.
What the hell?
You go back in first.
I'll go take her home.
She's that crazy fish vendor's sister.
He'll kill you.
Don't worry, idiot.
Just give me the ball.
Hurry and go.
Here.
Where'd you get that?
Who's there?
Miss.
What are you doing here?
It's dangerous, so go.
Give it back.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
What is that?
Hey.
Why do you have this?
Private Kim.
Want to hear a fun story?
While carrying the infantry's password back,
- that fish vendor's crazy sister kept smiling at me.
- So what?
No, just that she smiled.
- Is that all she did?
- Stop asking, it's embarrassing.
- Rainbow!
- It's me.
Hey, Private Kim.
Private Kang.
What are you doing here in your uniform?
You scared me.
- I came here on a weird intuition.
- What intuition?
- Give me your gun.
- Don't give it to him.
Give it back, or else we go to detention.
If Platoon Leader finds out, we're dead.
Hurry and go back.
To where?
What?
- You can't enter.
- It's me, Private Kang.
Remember?
Please stop doing this.
You were discharged a while ago.
- Who was discharged?
- Don't do this, and go back home.
I haven't finished my service yet.
I have a year left.
What's going on?
Sir, he keeps saying he's here for duty.
Salute.
- 1st Private Kang Han-chul here for duty.
- Kang Han-chul, wake up!
Platoon Leader, I'm fine.

Corporal Jang!
Stop moving.
Don't stand there, and move it.
Quickly.

- But he was our senior before.
Stop moving!
You've gone crazy, so stop.
Gone crazy?
Roll to the left.
Roll to the right.
Crawl forward.
You're pathetic.
On your head.
Listen carefully.
I'm still active.
Got it?
Yes, sir!
- I can't hear you.
- What the hell are you doing?
Why?
Is it wrong to straighten up these weaklings?
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy?
Who's crazy?
Sons of bitches, on your heads.
On your heads!
On your backs!
Back on your heads!
Listen carefully.
I'm not discharged.
I'm still your senior, 1st Private Kang Han-chul.
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.
I haven't discharged.
Got that?
What are you bastards doing?
Why are you taking orders from a civilian?
Get up!
- Don't move!
- Bastard, pull yourself together.
Go back to base.
It's detention for anyone who listens to this bastard.
Get moving!
Where are you going?
This place is forbidden to civilians.
Private Kim, go back in as well.
Hey, Kang Han-chul!
Are you crazy?
Damn it.
All because of a crazy lunatic.
What?
Did I say something wrong?
Why does that lunatic keep bothering us?
For punks or soldiers?
- Who ordered coffee?
- Here.
Just anyone take it.
What are you looking at?
- Damn it.
- Drink the coffee.
- Two sugars.
- Okay.
- Salute.
- Salute.
Weren't you discharged?
What's with the uniform?
- Like it that much?
- Who's discharged?
You've gone crazy like everyone said.
It's punishment for killing Young-gil.
You asshole!
Bastard!
You son of a bitch!
Bastard.
Mister.
Mister.
Are you okay?
Try to get up.
Han-chul, are you okay?
Young-gil.
Young-gil.
Young-gil.
Whoever was at the billiard come out.
The bastards who watched Private Kang get beaten!
Bend over.
- Bend over!
- I can't.
- What?
- Why do we have to help a civilian?
A lunatic at that.
He killed a civilian by mistake so why get on our case?
Bastard!
I'm being patient here, but outside the army, I don't lose to anyone.
- Don't abuse your seniority.
- Bastard.
If we had met outside...
Damn it.
- Bastard.
- Private Kim.
Please be patient.
- Put it on easy!
- Please be calm.
It's done.
Damn it.
All because of that crazy son of a bitch.
I think I know how he's feeling.
- Isn't he his comrade?
- Who are you kidding?
Why are you doing this?
It's just my opinion.
Salute.
- Get out of here, fuck.
- 2nd Private Cho.
Fuck, are you done talking?
Yeah, I'm done, you crazy bastard.

Hey, Han-chul.
What's up with your face?
Don't move!

Han-chul, stop it.
Know hard you're making it on us?
Please go to the hospital.
- Don't move.

I can't.
Think anybody can shoot a person?
Shoot.
Shoot me.
If not, I will.

Do you wanna die, asshole?

Son of a bitch is fucking with us.
Shit.
Until we find the gun, I won't report it.
- Keep it a secret.
Got it?
- Yes, sir!
Think Private Kang really stole the gun?
He won't shoot at us, right?
- Did you hear something?
- What?
Hey, Private Yoon.
Let me see.
You're okay.
What's going on?
Who fired?
- Cover the area.
- Private Yoon, get up.
- Where did it come from?
- Over there.
Kang Han-chul, you son of a bitch!
Salute.
- Salute.
- What happened?
Sorry, a new soldier fired by mistake, sir.
How come your platoon is a mess?
Get your act right, you idiot!
Think this is some survival game?

Stop it.
Calm yourself.
Raise your arms.
- Dispatch to your duties.

- Private Cho, aren't you scared?
- About what?
- What's to be scared about?
- Kang Han-chul stole Private Kim's gun.
Think he'll try to shoot you?
Don't say shit like that, bastard.
- I have to go piss.
Watch my gun.
- Okay.
What the hell?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Fucking bastard.
- Flag.

That was sneaky, damn it.
What was sneaky?
Stop playing games.
Don't act cowardly.
Let's fucking fight man to man instead, okay?

Shit.

Are you trying to ruin my career?
- Go catch that bastard now!
Got it?
- Yes, sir.
Run!
Line up!
Private Cho finally gets killed by Han-chul's gun.
No one knows who'll be next.
Kang Han-chul is now our enemy.
This may be absurd, but this is our sad reality.
From now, shoot anyone who shows up on the coast.
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!
Got it?
Got it?
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
You dumb son of a bitch!
You fucking bastard!
Are you badly hurt?
It's weird, huh?
How could a crazy guy shoot his heart precisely?
And plus at night?
You also hated Private Cho, right?
And you lost the fight.
- You're saying I shot him?
- Come on, no way.
Just that Private Cho was rude to his seniors.
If it was me...
They'd think Kang Han-chul would kill him anyway.
Where are you going?
That crazy bastard.
Anyway, where's Private Kim?

THE COAST GUARD
The Korean peninsula is the only divided country on earth
After the Korean War, South Korea's coastline have been surrounded by barbed wire fences to block any attack
Even now, whoever enters the coast after sunset, can be considered a spy and be killed
- Five minutes until roll call!
- Five minutes until roll call!
Get your asses moving now!
- Quickly!
- Yes, sir.
1st Private Kim.
Put it on my eyes.
Please stop.
I'm sick of it.
We'll see.
Whether I catch one or not.
We'll see what, you moron?
Think a spy will come to you?
Hurry it up!
- Take center!
- Taking center!
- Count to the right!
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
- Salute.
- Salute.
Coast Guard platoon, 23 reporting and one on duty.
All 23 ready for night watch, sir!
- At ease.
- Yes, sir.
At ease!
Our country faces the sea at three sides, and all coasts are restricted.
This zone especially was intruded by spies three times since the war.
Never let your guards down here.
You'll be commemorated for killing a spy, and be specially discharged.
You'll be honored for the rest of your life.
But if you miss one, you'll bring disgrace to your life forever.
Spies are unlike before.
They'll avoid being seen, and either shoot a poisoned dart or slice your neck off.
Hey, idiot.
Are you with special forces?
Get training from them?
!
If you'd like, I can do it, sir.
Want a bullet through your head?
Where's your helmet?
Before a spy shoots, I'll shoot first, sir.
Sure.
We'll see about that.
That is all.
About-face!
Raise your arms.
- March.
- March.
Coffee's here, honey.
- It's a card game.
- Get over here.
- Who's winning?
- He is.
The pot's mine now.
- I won!
- Shit!
Are you two cheating?
Get away from my sister.
- What are you looking at?
- Who's looking?
- Who cares if he does.
Honey, look at me, too.
- Yeah, army bastards never get laid.
- You low-life punks.
- Go.
Forget about them.
Spies don't exist anymore, damn it.
All you pigs do is play, and freeload off our taxes.
Cowards can't even shoot an empty gun.
Empty gun?
I see.
If you're brave, come and find out.
Fuck, you'll be in pieces.
After my grenade tears you apart.
You asshole!
You fucking assholes!
Don't!
- Dammit.
- None your bussiness
Stop it!
Stop it!
Fucking assholes!
I dare you to come to the coast at night.
I'll shoot you all even if you're not a spy.
Just go.
Think that bastard could shoot a spy for real?
If you test him out, I'll give you my sister.
Really?
Do it Young-gil.
- He'll give you Mee-young.
- Only if you come out alive.
- Duk-bae, heard that?
- Sure did.
You're crazy.
He said he'll definitely shoot.
Don't kid around.
- Saw her worry about me, right?
- Did you two already screw behind my back?
!
Shit!
Bunch of punks who didn't even serve.
Forget about it.
They're always like that.
Fucking assholes.
They better not cross my path.
Guard post 26.
All is clear.
Check a strange object at 500 meters ten o'clock.
I don't see anything.
It's a fishing tube, over.
Think we'll see a spy before we get discharged?
Do we really have to catch one?
Then why are we here?
I just hope nothing happens before I get discharged.
I'll lie in ambush over there.
A spy might come in there.
Platoon leader will get pissed.
Platoon.
- Night.
- Tent.
- Tailor.
- Raft.
- Target.

- Eh...
You screwed up!
Hey.
Pass it right.
Start over again.
You wanna die?
Hurry and go get it.
Damn turtle legs.
My kick's no good today.
You're dead already.
- What are you doing here?
- Can't you see?
Training for a surprise attack.
Next!
Come here 2nd Private Cho.
Get up, you bastard.
- I'll hit for real.
- Then do it!
- Don't regret it.
- Hit me, idiot!
I told you not to fight.
Please stop.
Are you okay, sir?
Fight me!
Fight me, you bastard!
You're next.
Fight!
Mount your beds and turn in.
Turning in, sir.
Kang Han-chul, load your song.
1st Private Kang Han-chul.

Shit, you two stop it.
Stop it!
Come on, she's gonna be my girl soon.
Have a drink.
Anyway, no way.
Got it?
Put your arm down now.
- Let's go.
- Go where?
Just follow me if you like me.
WARNING
Bastards can't even shoot a fish.
Okay.
I'm a spy, so shoot.
Shoot, you bastards.
Mee-young.
Why do you look so pretty today?
Let's hug, and stop teasing me.
- Do you love me?
- Of course.
What are you doing?
Get out of there.
Come over here.
If you do, I'll hug you.
Are you crazy?
Stop kidding around, and come out.
Remember the old lady who got shot last year?
Bastards got commended and went on leave.
So you don't love me?
Are you crazy?
Stop playing, and come out now.
They shoot at night no matter what.
- Scared you might get shot?
- Aren't you scared?
I heard they shoot to get discharged.
Now you're all mine.
It feels great.
Is it a spy?
Young-gil...
Over here!
- What is it?
- Check!
Don't touch it!
I caught that spy!
Hurry and check now!
- Don't come any closer!
- Bastard.
Looks like one of those punks.
- This is the killed civilian, sir.
- Who's the soldier that did it?
1st Private Kang Han-chul sitting over there.
My Young-gil!
Get out of my way!
- Didn't he look drunk to you?
- I don't know.
- Weren't you scared?
- I don't know.
Mee-young, are you okay?
Why'd you get drunk and go in there?
Take a rest.
Good work.
Why'd you go in knowing you could get shot?
She seems a bit strange.
Who killed my son?
You murderer.
Is it you?
You murderer!
Bring my son back!
Bring my son back!
Bring my son back.
- You rotten bastard.
You rotten bastard.
- Take her away!
Bring my son back.
Hey shithead!
Is Young-gil a spy?
Can a soldier shoot anyone?
Move back and be quiet.
How can I be quiet after a civilian was killed?
You murderers!
I told you not to come in here.
This is a military zone.
Cut the crap, and give me that murderer!
Think I can't kill someone without a gun?
The soldier did nothing wrong.
He just carried out his duty!
And if he was a spy, who response to that
You son of a bitch!
Take them out!
Hands-up.Don't move
Hurry up!
If you make a trouble
- Salute.
- Salute.
prize!
While 1st Private Kang Han-chul was on duty at 3am, he used proper measures to stop an infiltrator.
So we commemorate him for his loyal duty.
Recognized by 2459 Battalion Commander

- Salute.
Stop it.
Sleep.
How dare you?
How could you smash a boy's toy?
You son of a bitch.
Call yourself a soldier?
Do you?
Stop looking at the ocean.
It won't make Young-gil come back.
Rotten army bastards.
Damn it.
What the hell are you doing?
I have to sell those.
Damn it.
Mee-young.
Mee-young!
What the hell's wrong with you?
- Cheers!
- Congratulations.
Is it a special or regular leave?
What are you on leave for?
What's wrong with you?
On leave, you always talked all night about soldier stories.
- That's my drink.
- Drink a little.
Hey, did you catch a spy?
Or kill a drunk civilian who crossed the line?
Heard they give you a break if you do.
What's wrong with you?
Hey!
Why'd you act that way?
Something happen at the base?
Your hand.
What's wrong with you?
Was it true what Hyung-shik said?
What's wrong with you?
Please say something.
Give me the ball.
Hurry and give it.
Your call cannot be connected.
Why are you doing this?
I'm sorry.
Talk to me!
Let go of me!
It was my duty!
Hey !

Sun-hwa!
Hey.
Why'd you go in there?
Come out quickly.
Come out quickly!
Young-gil.
Young-gil.
Bastard, get up!
What are you gonna do?
You murdering son of a bitch!
What are you gonna do about my crazy sister?
Come here, you bastard.
Young-gil.
No.
No.
Are you alright?
It must hurt a lot.
Rotten bastards went too far.
Are you okay?
Hurry it up.
Work faster by the fence.
Hurry it up!
Private Kang, sir.
How did it feel at that time?
You know, when you shot that drunk guy.
Besides a war, when could you ever shoot someone?
Did you pull the trigger right as you saw him?
But you emptied a whole magazine.
If it were me, I couldn't have fired.
I heard soldiers who went to Vietnam liked it later.
They shot at whatever they wanted.
- What's with you, Private Kang?
- Let go!
I'm sorry, Private Cho.
Stop doing that, you're making me nervous.
Something happen with Sun-hwa on break?
Where are you going?
- Seoul.
- What?
Hey, Private Kang!
Who is it?
Who is it?
You bastard.
Hurry up!
Go!
Hey!
Private Kang!
Pull over!
Are you crazy?
Know what you're doing now?
Want to ruin your life?
His mental state is unstable, so he looks unfit for duty.

Let's just take one picture.

- It's glass.
- What is this?
Be careful.
I'll take it.
I'm taking it.
Smile.
One, two, three.
Miss, you can't take pictures here.

Here I go.

One, two...
- Wait.
I'm taking it.
One, Two...

- It's for the spies.
- But I got cut.
- Glass shouldn't be there.
- Private Kim!
- Sir, everything is clear!
Clear?
Who told these girls to come in here and take pictures?
Ladies, this is a restricted zone.
No pictures here.
We're not spies.
What are you doing?
- We have other pictures, you know.
- Be grateful we're not arresting you.
You careless bastard.
Wanna go to detention?
Do your duty right!
Stop coming back here.
Get out of there.
Give me the gun!
Young-gil.
Young-gil.
Young-gil.
What the hell?
You go back in first.
I'll go take her home.
She's that crazy fish vendor's sister.
He'll kill you.
Don't worry, idiot.
Just give me the ball.
Hurry and go.
Here.
Where'd you get that?
Who's there?
Miss.
What are you doing here?
It's dangerous, so go.
Give it back.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
What is that?
Hey.
Why do you have this?
Private Kim.
Want to hear a fun story?
While carrying the infantry's password back,
- that fish vendor's crazy sister kept smiling at me.
- So what?
No, just that she smiled.
- Is that all she did?
- Stop asking, it's embarrassing.
- Rainbow!
- It's me.
Hey, Private Kim.
Private Kang.
What are you doing here in your uniform?
You scared me.
- I came here on a weird intuition.
- What intuition?
- Give me your gun.
- Don't give it to him.
Give it back, or else we go to detention.
If Platoon Leader finds out, we're dead.
Hurry and go back.
To where?
What?
- You can't enter.
- It's me, Private Kang.
Remember?
Please stop doing this.
You were discharged a while ago.
- Who was discharged?
- Don't do this, and go back home.
I haven't finished my service yet.
I have a year left.
What's going on?
Sir, he keeps saying he's here for duty.
Salute.

You've gone crazy, so stop.
Gone crazy?
Roll to the left.
Roll to the right.
Crawl forward.
You're pathetic.
On your head.
Listen carefully.
I'm still active.
Got it?
Yes, sir!
- I can't hear you.
- What the hell are you doing?
Why?
Is it wrong to straighten up these weaklings?
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy?
Who's crazy?
Sons of bitches, on your heads.
On your heads!
On your backs!
Back on your heads!
Listen carefully.
I'm not discharged.
I'm still your senior, 1st Private Kang Han-chul.

- Yes, sir.
I haven't discharged.
Got that?
What are you bastards doing?
Why are you taking orders from a civilian?
Get up!

- Bastard, pull yourself together.
Go back to base.
It's detention for anyone who listens to this bastard.
Get moving!
Where are you going?
This place is forbidden to civilians.
Private Kim, go back in as well.
Hey, Kang Han-chul!
Are you crazy?
Damn it.
All because of a crazy lunatic.
What?
Did I say something wrong?
Why does that lunatic keep bothering us?
For punks or soldiers?
- Who ordered coffee?
- Here.
Just anyone take it.
What are you looking at?
- Damn it.
- Drink the coffee.
- Two sugars.
- Okay.
- Salute.
- Salute.
Weren't you discharged?
What's with the uniform?

Whoever was at the billiard come out.

Bend over.
- Bend over!
- I can't.
- What?
- Why do we have to help a civilian?
A lunatic at that.
He killed a civilian by mistake so why get on our case?
Bastard!
I'm being patient here, but outside the army, I don't lose to anyone.
- Don't abuse your seniority.
- Bastard.
If we had met outside...
Damn it.
- Bastard.
- Private Kim.
Please be patient.
- Put it on easy!
- Please be calm.
It's done.

- Don't worry.
I'll make sure she doesn't get hurt.
You also did it, huh?
- What?
- Tell me the truth, if you want to end it.
Hey.Corporal Jang.

Corporal Jang, go get her.
Do it.
There's no anesthetic.

You can't!

Let go!

Let go!
Please calm down.
We're scared, too.
Get out of my way.
Haven't you finished yet?
I'm almost done.
Please stop it!
Sun of bitch !

Finished, right?
I'm sorry, Private Kim.
Private Kim, we know how you feel.
We're going crazy, too.
Die!

Wake up, Unit 3!
Hey, get your asses up now.
It's time for duty.

Where are my boots?
Private Kim.
Who'd take our stuff?

Could it be Private Kang?
My gun!
Shit, wait.
This is bad.
What should I do?
You idiots!
Where the hell are your brains?
You lose your precious gun?
You bastard!
Teach your soldiers right!
Get up, you bastard!
- Who the hell took it?
- I think it was Kang Han-chul.
Son of a bitch is fucking with us.
Shit.
Until we find the gun, I won't report it.
- Keep it a secret.
Got it?
- Yes, sir!
Think Private Kang really stole the gun?
He won't shoot at us, right?
- Did you hear something?
- What?
Hey, Private Yoon.
Let me see.
You're okay.
What's going on?
Who fired?
- Cover the area.
- Private Yoon, get up.
- Where did it come from?
- Over there.
Kang Han-chul, you son of a bitch!
Salute.
- Salute.
- What happened?
Sorry, a new soldier fired by mistake, sir.
How come your platoon is a mess?
Get your act right, you idiot!
Think this is some survival game?

2nd Commander.
How the hell are you training your boys?
Get it right!

- Yes, sir!
Calm down.
- You bastard!
- Let go!
Stop it.
Calm yourself.
Raise your arms.
- Dispatch to your duties.

- Private Cho, aren't you scared?
- About what?
- What's to be scared about?
- Kang Han-chul stole Private Kim's gun.
Think he'll try to shoot you?
Don't say shit like that, bastard.
- I have to go piss.
Watch my gun.
- Okay.
What the hell?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Fucking bastard.
- Flag.
- Hibiscus flower.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
That was sneaky, damn it.
What was sneaky?
Stop playing games.
Don't act cowardly.
Let's fucking fight man to man instead, okay?
Fucking fight?
Finished talking?
Shit.
Get up!
Get up!
Private Cho, please stop.
Let go!
Let go!
Saw what happened, huh?
- But you went too far, and...
- And what?
What, you bastard?
Private Cho!
Private Cho!
Platoon Leader!
Platoon Leader!
Hurry, Private Cho is going to die!
Cover all sides!
Medic!
Shit.
Kang Han-chul is fucking crazy!
He's in serious pain.
Hurry it up.
Son of a bitch.
Are you trying to ruin my career?
- Go catch that bastard now!
Got it?
- Yes, sir.
Run!
Line up!
Private Cho finally gets killed by Han-chul's gun.
No one knows who'll be next.
Kang Han-chul is now our enemy.
This may be absurd, but this is our sad reality.
From now, shoot anyone who shows up on the coast.
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!
Got it?
Got it?
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
You dumb son of a bitch!
You fucking bastard!
Are you badly hurt?
It's weird, huh?
How could a crazy guy shoot his heart precisely?
And plus at night?
You also hated Private Cho, right?
And you lost the fight.
- You're saying I shot him?
- Come on, no way.
Just that Private Cho was rude to his seniors.
If it was me...
They'd think Kang Han-chul would kill him anyway.
Where are you going?
That crazy bastard.
Anyway, where's Private Kim?
*Music* If that happy day could return *Music*
*Music* Tracing back to that fading memory If only I could express my feelings now *Music*
*Music* No matter how much I regret The past has already gone *Music*
Freeze!
Throw your weapon down!
TH E D O G TR I C K
Simon here.
Oh, is that the time?
I'm on my way.
I'm just going to watch...
I mean, get dressed.
I've just had a shower.
But I am coming!
Right.
See you.
Written and directed by Christian EkIöw Christopher Panov
Why can't he let it go...
But maybe they'II recognize him.
Recognize who?
It's been about five years!
- Two years.
-OK.
Two years since he was in...
Robinson Survivors.
It's me
- Survivor-Micke.
-Hey...
I'm a star.
-I haven't got time.
I realize this is a stressed scene for you...
A couple of friends from out of town, who haven't done StockhoIm...
Famous or not, everyone queues here.
Go to the back.
-But...
-To the back!
Now!
Did it do the trick?
No.
It makes no odds,famous or not.
Everyone has to queue.
No shit!
-How's things?
-Great.
-Lot of people this evening...
-Shit!
I thought he'd broken my neck.
The frigging idiot!
-When you called him 'BeIgian blue?
'
-Whose side are you on?
-Simon,you're on my side, eh?
-well, I feel...
See?
Simon's on my side.
Mario here.
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm at some dump with Simon and Robinson-Micke.
Love you too.
Kisses.
Bye.
How long have you two been going steady?
-Three years.
-Three?
bloody hell.
-still in love?
-You bet we are.
Hey, Mario.
Same chick for three years.
-problems?
-Not that again!
Simon, come by work tomorrow.
I'II buy you lunch.
-Bye.
Say hi to Sanna.
-See you, Micke!
Right, Mum's gone.
Now for some booze.
-I'm tired...
-One more beer, Simon.
Simon here.
What do you fucking think!
I'm getting the beers.
Four?
You're insane!
I'm nearly unbeatable at survival.
-How long since Big Brother?
-You mean Survivor.
Since Survivor.
-It wasn't kid's stuff like Brother is.
-I meant Survivor.
A year or two back.
-Were you in the papers?
-Quite a bit,for a while.
Were you?
As a star you've got to watch your intrepidy.
Too much media can make you a 2nd class star.
You've got to stay on top...
-...if you see what I mean.
-Yes!
-Can we see your Survivor tapes?
-Watch some?
Of course you can watch Survivor!
Micke, please.
We've seen it so many times.
Not again.
well...no.
Forget it,then.
It tickled...
I'd better leave.
I've got to go to workin the morning.
-I enjoyed meeting you.
-Yeah, me too.
Bye,then...
Bye, Emma.
Listen...
If you want to watch it I can put it on.
-If you want to.
-I couldn't give a damn.
But if you want to...
No.
Okay.
-Simon!
Was it you?
-Eh?
-Must you?
!
-Ooh, Robinson !
Just a quick look,then.
-Right, I'm off out.
Have a good time.
-Thanks.
See you.
welcome to the first new episode of Survivor.
You viewers will know...
He's absolutely gorgeous.
I mean, he's much better than the new guy.
-I'II tell you something about him...
-That's you!
You bet.
So you're rearing to go.
And your single possession Is.:
a condom.
So cool!
But if you want to roll round In the sand more than once?
Easy-I'II recycle it!
"recycle!
recycle..."
Did you see that?
Oy!
Jesus!
...a winner.
In this year's Survivor series there's a new game...
If it hadn't been for that bastard...
Let's say it's gonna be muddy.
-Watch Sports News last night?
-No...
I was out.
Hammarby could well move up.
-I'II be getting tickets.
-That won't be easy.
But you can always get hold of some.
So Micke got the usual going after the party, did he?
Yeah.
A bit of heavy kissing?
Yeah.
Rather, not me.
But Micke got the heavies.
The chick I was with was a bit...shy.
She was shy?
well, it was me that was.
Christ,you know what I'm like!
-I'm like a...
-You needn't get angry with me!
honestly, Simon Iove- "the hollywood life," as you call it- can't be found in a bar.
You're hardly going to find someone any old how.
But you don't have to go chasing disco chicks with Micke.
I'm sick of being single.
I want to meet someone, fall in love.
Sooner or later you'II find someone.
Look at me.
The local grocery,three years ago.
-You forgot your ketchup.
-And?
Otherwise you'd never have met Sanna.
-Coincidence...
It happens.
-But all this waiting!
Did he put Survivor on?
Staff to deIIcounter, please...
Hi.
-Hi there!
-Hi.
I've only got a little ketchup and stuff.
could i go first?
-Go ahead.
-really kind of you.
I...think I forgot my ketchup.
Have you taken it?
Eh?
-My ketchup, you haven't got it?
-Ask him.
Hey,your ketchup!
-In your bag maybe?
-It's at the check-out!
When were you last really in love with someone?
Let me tell you about" Iove."
Chicks...they can faII in love.
But guys can't.
Lay off.
I really want to fall in love.
I've never had a real relationship.
I want someone to share everything with, all the fun, all the rough going.
-Just like Mario.
-It's an illusion.
You were in love with bella.
You and Mario know what love is...
I wasn't in love with her.
I wasn't!
I was too young to know any better.
-Sure...
-Today i know better.
We both know it's just not true.
You just say that because you got so dumped!
Look at me, how I'm hung!
I can have any girl i want.
It was a stupid teenage love affair!
You were stunned for two years by a "stupid teenage love affair."
Know what your problem is?
You're in love with love.
-See?
-At least I'm in love with something.
-Yiippee!
-Good.
That takes care of that.
-Let me thrash you at Tekken.
-I've got to go...
-I've got a French lecture at 8 a.m.
-Shit...
-could you lend me my bus fare?
-In my jacket.
-Thanks for the pizza.
-Okay.
See you.
-Teenage love affair...
-Have you found my wallet?
Thanks.
See you.
Oh, shit!
Hi there, Micke!
-You're upset...
-I'm sorry!
-...but this isn't what you think.
-Shutup, Pontus!
Micke...
Let's get started:
Sweden v.YugosIavia.You're gonna get good 'n' thrashed, Mario!
-Remember last time?
-I've deleted that from my memory!
-Hiya.
-Hiya.
-Have you already started?
-No.
-You're brazil?
-Of course.
Why are your pants down?
-Ask Mario.
-Get your pants off!
.
-Sorry?
-Did you come on the Tube?
-Yes?
-Get your pants off,then!
What do you mean?
How many junkies used your seat before you did?
The filth they leave gets sucked up into your pants...
-"Sucked up!"
-And then dumped in my new sofa.
Get'em off!
.
-I'm serious.
Get them off!
.
-You're sick.
You need help.
-please remove your pants!
-No.
-Let's skip the rest.
-It's the final...
Let's go out and have a beer and then see.
I said i was going to rent a video.
Lay off.
-Simon...
Sippy?
-Quit it.
-One beer!
-Quit it!
Fuck!
What is it?
!
No, I'm not coming.
I've got reading to do.
-Goal!
-Re-run!
That wasn't fair!
-You needn't get so worked up.
-Don't interrupt, then!
I won't bother talking to you again,then, ever.
-Hi, guys!
-Hi, Sanna.
-hello.
-hello, sweetheart.
-Hi, Simon.
-Mmm.
-What's the score?
-It'II soon be 6-0.
-And...
Are you watching?
There!
-For Christ's goddam sake!
So frigging bad.
That's enough humiliation for one day.
- Hi, Sanna!
- I'm off home.
See you tomorrow.
-Hungry, sweetheart?
-A bit.
shall we make some food?
-How about you?
-No thanks.
Erik Jansson?
-Here.
-That's you then, loud and clear.
Giorgos AstrapopoIis?
There!
Dad's a cop, is he?
I mean 'police'- 'Astropo-police'...
Emma Larsson.
-Emma Larsson?
-Here i am.
Simon Svensson.
Simon Svensson?
No?
Svensson's a deserter.
-Cross him out,then.
-Here!
You didn't hear me call your name twice?
-But...
-Or at Ieast once?
Perhaps you think i mumble.
Perhaps all the others just guessed I'd said their names.
I doubt it.
D-a-n-i-e-I K-a-r-I-s-s-o-n.
KA R L S S ON.
Hi, Micke.
It's Simon.
Guess who's at my French course.
Emma!
No kidding!
So what happened?
-Micke.
-Unbelievable!
Micke, lend a frigging hand!
I've got to go.
Mario called.
We're playing a TV-game at eight.
-Okay?
-Micke!
Shit!
See you.
-You can certainly talk on the phone.
-I'm sorry that my mum's in emergency.
Forgive me, if I'm a bit worried about her health.
Hi.
I feel so frigging awful.
What's happened?
-I've got such a hell of a problem.
-Come in...
I'd rather stay put.
Such a terrible problem because I can't make my mind up as to which of these wonderful girls i want.
-feel at home.
-No, Micke...
Don't spoil it all now.
The redhead's got a wicked crush on you.
Got any beers?
little sis been watching a tearjerker?
Go easy on Simon.
He's never been in love so he escapes into hollywood movies.
-No picture in my wallet...
-Don't mumble!
At least I don't have a picture of my only, old love in my wallet.
Have you been snooping in my wallet?
Shit-face.
You call...just to hear her on the answering machine...
He got out of bed on the wrong side.
We're off.
The party's over.
I'm sick of you always moaning.
-always?
-Yes, always.
always belly aching: "Look at Mario...
I want to be really in love."
Snap out of it!
How can you meet a girl if you're home watching Pretty Woman?
Right, girls!
We're off.
-Simon.
I've got this great thing.
-What thing?
I'm talking to Simon.
Simon!
-Don't walk across...!
-I'm only going to say it once.
-Say it,then!
-Right!
This friend of mine has had a girl problem like yours.
But now he's got so many girls, he can't make his mind up.
-Do you know why?
-please.
I'm bursting to know.
-Okay...
The dogtrick.
-What?
The dogtrick:
Buy a nice pup.
walk it in the park and the girls'II all be hanging round your neck.
You mean he's got to buy a dog?
Or borrow a damn dog.
Who cares whose the thing is.
It's fresh, solid girls- none of your disco chick types.
And how would you know, Mr Expert?
Dogs bring out the mother in women.
They see you patting the dog and think: "He'II be sweet to our children,too, if we have any."
You really believe it works?
It's absolutely nuts.
I don't care.
It says so in 'Illusionated Science.'
Professors have written articles and proved it.
-And it worked for your mate?
-His wedding's in a month.
-Oh,that guy with all the girls?
-No.That was Jonas.
-Has it worked for lots of people?
-For everyone!
It can't fall.
-Even for you, Simon.
-Why not try it yourself, then?
You know I don't want the cozy suburban life.
-Right.
-I pick up chicks at bars instead.
Gotcha!
Luck.
Hey...
Sanna's sister's just got a dog.
-You are kidding, aren't you?
-Of course I'm kidding.
-What a lovely little dog!
-Isn't it.
-And where are you going?
-To the vet.
Is he not well?
He's going to be run down...
i mean put down.
Oh!
Whatever for?
He's a schizophrenic.
He thinks he's a cat, scratches and meaows.
Listen!
-Poor thing!
-It's terrible.
-Oh, no!
He's having one of his fits.
-Get him away from me!
Run for it!
Or he'II bite you!
He's attacking!
Run, lady!
Let's go.
-Sorry!
-It's quite all right.
-What a sweet dog!
-Dachshund.
It's a dachshund.
Hi.-What it's name?
Fido.
-He seems to like you.
-Yes...
-Love at first sight.
-Yes.
really.
I'm Simon.
Hi.
Maria..."Mia."
-Are you going that way?
-What?
Yes!
I am.
Good.We can walk together.
-Do you live round here?
-No...
well,yes...not too far off.
-How old's...
-25.
I meant the dog.
-Oh...er...
It's 25- dog years.
-The same as you, then.
Yes.
Same as me!
unbelievable!
Everything was great between us- it all came together.
-Okay!
Didn't think it'd work, Micke.
-My ideas always do.
-When's your next date,then?
-Dunno.
I can't call her.
-Don't you dare?
-No.
I mean yes...
We never swapped phone numbers.
-What did you say?
-It's so stupid we talked for hours and then...
You meet your dream girl and you don't swap numbers!
You're nuts!
I come along, i put the ball on the spot and i tie your bootIaces but how do you thank me?
By shooting over the bar!
-You're worse than the yellows!
-Oh thanks.
I feel much better now!
Worse than the yellows Worse than the black 'n' yellows
Mia.
Mia...
Wait!
Hell!
Mia,wait!
Get a move on!
-To OdenpIan...
-No pets.
-He's iII.We're in a hurry!
-No pets in the cab.
Wait!
- Come on!
Wait there.
Don't go away.
-Drive towards OdenpIan.
Hurry!
-What address?
Listen...that bus has got the girl of my dreams in it.
Okay?
I might never see her again.
So,foot down!
Just like in the movies!
Right, we'II tall them like Miami Vice.
I'm Tubbs and you're Crocket.
Great!
Look at this, my friend.
-beautiful, isn't she!
-Yes, she is.
But she's gone,for good.
-I'm sorry.
-I'II never forgive myself, my friend.
-Oy!
-It's a crosswalk!
Just drive, please!
My friend's beloved is in that bus.
Thanks for ruining his life!
Thanks a Iot!
people have no respect for love anymore.
No respect!
The bus.
See it?
There!
Let me off here and I'II run.
-Is 100 enough?
-No problem.
Thanks,Tubbs!
What the...!
Shit-the dog!

Or is it my head buzzing?

-Read it!
'The basic verb form is... ' '... avoir.'
Just read it.
-Don't let me bother you.
Just read.
-I can't...
Read Iouder and clearer so all your friends can hear you!
-Hard going,was it?
-Yes.
Get the gist?
Be on time in future.
Sit where you want, I'm feeling generous.
For Christ's sake!
Hey,you!

It's really weird, our doing the French course.
I started late.
I was fifth reserve...
Why are you doing French?

You forget it very quickly.

-Tight's cool.

-well,yes, actually.
-The scarf'II have to do, then.

Leave him be.
You know what it's like.
-I'm not playing with him again.
-Lay off!
.
Let's get going.
Don't be so grumpy.
What's the one with...
Debra Winger?
-An Officer and a Gentleman.
-Isn't it great?
Wicked!
The last scene's brilliant, everyone doing a standing ovation.
-So wicked!
-A pity it only happens in films.
Yes.
-Don't say you Iike that film,too!
-A real favorite...
-You can't mean it!
-It's true.
So beautiful with julia Roberts in the car, crying, looking out of the window!
And they play' It Must Have Been Love'
- Roxette.
It's so beautiful.
It's so sad...
Though you know from the start it'II end okay.
-And yet you cry.
-Yes, each time you see it.
I always think the Iast scene's when they aren't going to meet...
-...but then the real end comes.
-Richard in his white limo...
-...with a bouquet.
-Her knight on a white horse that she's dreamt about all her life.
So beautiful.
Go for it!
Are you trying to kill me?
-40- Iove.
Match point.
-It was out!
-What?
-It was In , partner.
Shit, it was about six inches out.
-You can still see the mark...
-We're 5- 0 down.
Does it matter?

If they want to win by cheating, that's cool.
Great fun.

We're winning!
-Can we play?
It's getting cold.

-She fucking aimed at me!
-bloody unsportsmanIike!
-Thanks for a very exciting match!
It was an unbelievably fun game of tennis.
Thanks a Iot.
-He's so...
-Why can't he...?
Sorry we're late.
Micke's hair needs...
Hiya, Sanna...!
-Hiya.
-Hi.
-Want a ride?
-You bet.
-We're going out tonight.
Okay?
-Eh?

Study and stuff.
Forget it.
Want a ride to the Tube?
-No...

-What's the problem?
Let's go!
-Get going.

-Nice to meet you, Mia.
-Same here.
Mia here.
My mum.
No, he's still believes it all.
Why, has he said something to you?
No?
Then what's the fuss!
I am going to end it, but I can't just leave, now!
AII right, all right.
I promise this is the very last date.
Yes!
Right.
Bye.
-What did she say?
-Nothing.
Can we go on watching?
The moment we've all been waiting for this evening:

The big question:

And it says here:

Can you feel the excitement?
The winner is:

Dead right!
Wicked!
AII right!
-Hiya.
-Hi.
-Is Sanna at home?
-No.
She's on night duty.
-Can i sleep here?
-Yeah, but what's happened?
She's there, kissing well she's getting in close with that idiot from Survivor.
Micke...
About to shove his hairy tongue down her throat and choke her.
Micke, I know this sounds a bit like a cliché...
-...but you've got to forget her.
-I can't.
I know it's really hard...
-...but she has really hurt you.
-Yes.
Wait a sec.
Put it this way:
If she was to come back to you, do you really think it wouId work?
-Yes.
-honestly?
well...yes.
I think it wouId...
Listen to yourself, you're hesitant.
Yes I am.
So what the hell do I do?
-Mario...
-Yes?
Don't mention this to Simon.
You mean about our sleeping head to tail in my super-narrowbed?
precisely.
Simon.
Hi.
I can hear who it is!
What's cookin'?
Come here and chill out,then.
Just zap around a bit.
There's someone on the other phone.
I'II come over to your place later.
Bye.
Mia here.
BonsoIr, honey.What are you doing?
Listen, I've spoken to olivia at Air France.
She said...

Can't we discuss it tomorrow?
.

Yes.
Great.
Kisses.
Love you,too.

-It's piddling down!
-I can see it is.
Hi.
-I bought some food.
-Great.
Put it there.
-I'II get you a dry shirt.
-Thanks.
-We need to discuss something.
-Just coming.
Oh, my God...
well, I thought...
-You're...
-wonderful.
-Crazy!
-Thanks!
-You did say you were hungry.
-But all this!
-What's in the envelope?
-Open it and see.
-Say...
-Open it!
-Jesus, how great!
- director's cut.
I can take my sister.
She loves Pretty Woman.
Oh...
Okay.
I'm pulling your leg.
Of course I'II see it with you.
Right!
What's the matter?
-She just left.
-And?
-I don't see...
Everything was great.
-Didn't she say anything?
Just got up and said she was sorry.
-Why did she say sorry?
-No idea.
She said: "Sorry, Simon.
I can't explain it," and then...
left.
-You've called?
-Answering machine.
-cell?
-Same there.
-hell!
What can I do?
-You can't do anything about it.
The ball's in her court.
It's up to her to make contact.
Shit!
Always fucking tilting!
Three wonderful weeks...
-call, put some pressure on.
-But how long can i do that for...?
could that be her?
It could be Mia!
Where the hell's my cellphone?
-Christ, it's her
- Mia.
-Answer,then!
Simon here.
Hi.
What the...!
Mia, my battery's running out.
Can you call Micke's cell?
073 064 9424.
Did you get...?
She's going to ring yours.
That's for me!
That's for me!
Take it easy!
Micke's phone.This is Simon.
Hi.
Yes.
Of course.
In an hour?
Bye.
-Did you sort it out?
-I don't know.
-Why's Mia's number on your cell?
-Her mates dug Survivor-Micke so I offered to date them.
-I see.
-What did she say?
-She sounded so weird.
-She said we had to talk.
-About what?
-I don't know.
-She didn't say?
I just don't get it.
See you later.
-Wish me good luck.
-Good luck.
Good luck.
High score!
-Where are you off to?
-See the boss.
It tilts all the time.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Has something happened?
-Let's walk a bit.
Simon...
Yes?
I think it's been really fantastic, meeting you.
But?
But there's something I haven't told you.
What is it?
What's happened?
Nothing's happened.
well,yes, something has happened, or rather...
I don't know how to tell you.
I've got a boyfriend.
What?
It sounds pretty rough, but it's not rough really.
So it's not rough?
well what the hell Is it,then?
He's in Paris.
I'm not sure we're still steady.
well we are...
-...but we never see each other...
-Why didn't you tell me?
I would have, but I didn't want to spoil what we had going.
As if you hadn't spoilt anything now!
Fuck...
Okay...
So what happens now?
.
What happens now?
.
I need to think about what i really want.
FooIing around a bit until you leave for...
-It wasn't like that!
-What was it like, then?
!
I really like you, Simon.
But I need time to think.
Okay?
Take all the time you want.
I don't care what the fuck you decide!
Wait a min...
A vodka- cranberry.
A beer, please.
Are you on your own this evening?
Eh?
You ordered just the one beer.
So?
If you'd been with friends or your boyfriend, you'd have ordered more.
-The beer's for my boyfriend.
-Woops.
Is he French?
Goodbye.
-Hi, little sis'!
-God, how I've missed you!
And I've missed you!
-Is that all you've got?
-thailand next.
-Are you kidding?
-No.
-How long will you be there?
-Six months.
-I can't face it!
-How are you,then?
-I'm fine.
-Are you?
Just a bit hungry.
Let's go home and have something to eat and a glass of wine.
Okay?
Ho ware you, love?
You're so quiet.
I can see something's up.
I've made such a fool of myself.
Is it that bad?
What's happened?
Is it Andrés?
No.
-I've been so damn stupid.
-Oh, sweetheart.
So damn stupid...
It'II be okay.
-Are things serious,you and...?
-Simon.
-How did you meet?
-That's the...problem...
There was this conspiracy- our meeting had been planned.
-A blind date?
-well, not really.
It was a bit...
I met an old friend at a bar and I bet him I couId get this friend of his to fall in love with me.
So stupid.
But I thought it sounded a bit of a laugh.
I was moving abroad anyway.
But I started seeing this guy and...
-And you fell in love with him.
-Head over heals in love.
So you won't be moving to Paris.
I don't know.
No, I'm...
I might as well move there.
Simon hates me now anyway, so...
could you answer?
Mia's phone.This is Lisa.
Hi,Andrés.
Fine. and you?
No.
She's not in.
Oh...
Hang on a minute.
B J H, okay.
Yes, I'II tell her.
Bye.
What did he say?
Hey...tell me what he said!
He's booked your flight.
-I've got the number.
-Oh, fuck!
Hi, Simon!
hello.
hello.
Want to see Simon?
There was some blond chick here but she just split...
For God's sake!
Mia!
-Who was that?
-Eh?
No one.
-I put your T-shirt on the bed.
-Thanks.
-Hope we meet again some time.
-You bet.
-See you.
-Bye.
Bye!
Why did she have to turn up just then?
-Why?
Is that a crime?
-But she's already got a guy...
-...so she's playing it wrong.
Not you!
-Perhaps she came to say...
-...that she'd dumped the French guy.
-That's just your imagination.
Forget the whole thing.
Yeah, maybe.
What if I've ruined everything due to a stupid one-night stand.
AII you can do is find out how she feels about it all.
-That'd be heavy shit.
-But it could hardly make it worse.
Forget her now!
That's my opinion.
She's been lying to you.
You deserve better.
The bloody soap stings!
-You must not let Simon in on all this.
-I've got to!
-Don't.
It'II only make things worse.
-Maybe...
-...but I can't go on lying.
-Not lie, just say nothing!
-You're not seeing him anymore.
-No?
-But you're moving to Paris!
-Micke, don't you understand?
-I'm in love with Simon.
-In love?
Correct me if I'm wrong but, only yesterday, didn't he screw some other girl?
You've won your 2,000.
So now it's over.
Do you think I'm stupid?
To hell with the bet!
-Who's that?
-It'II be my sister.
-How old is she?
-Shutup!
Just a joke...just fooling.
Simon!
-Why are you here?
-Can I come in?
What?
I think we ought to talk.
Yes, but...can't we...
Can't i come over to your place this evening?
I've got so much...
-Right.
About eight?
-Great.
-Is Micke here?
-How come?
That's his jacket!
-Hiya...
Simon!
-Hiya, yourself!
.
-What are you doing here?
-What I'm doing here?
well, Mia...borrowed one of my CDs.
ACD?
I thought I'd just...pick it up and well, I'II be going.
I'II call you later...
"Meditation." And when did you start meditating?
-So you didn't know I did?
-Quit it, Micke, for God's sake!
There's something we've got to tell you, Simon.
That girl with a crush on Survivor-Micke is nuts...
Shutup, Micke!
Let Mia speak.
-I've got to split...
-Stay here,you!
well?
Out with it.
Let's have it!
I met Micke down at the bar and we started talking a bit and he told me about a friend who'd never fallen in Iove.That's it.
-really?
And?
-And so...he bet me I couldn't get you to fall in love with me in two weeks.
-What?
-We bet 2,000.
We set it up like a hollywood movie.
Right, Micke?
Like a what?
You wanted the hollywood movie life.
I thought I'd help you.
-You're fucking crazy!
-You weren't meant to find out...
How kind!
So that justifies it all?
It's...just not true!
-It's so crazy!
-I'm really sorry, Simon...
That dogtrick...
Was the whole thing fixed?
Yes, it was.
Yes...
Jesus, Mia, you're so damn...
It's so goddam sick!
And you, Micke...
You can go to hell!
My back's hardly turned and you're screwing someone else!
-Who's got a boyfriend!
-I don't screw around!
I'm damn glad I screwed her!
She didn't get paid.
Or have you fixed that,too, Survivor-Micke?
Christ, couldn't you goddam see I was so in love with you?
Simon here.
please leave a message.
Hi, Simon, it's me...
Mia.
I just want to say I'm very sorry about what's happened and I'd Iike to talk to you.
would you give me a call, so I can explain?
please let me do that.
I miss you.
Goodbye.
-How could you be so fucking stupid?
-I wanted to help him.
Can't you try and explain to me...
As a friend, how could you think up something so idiotic without realizing it might end in disaster?
-well, I thought she might...
-You didn't think at all, it seems.
-You've got to sort it with Simon.
-Don't you think I've tried?
I've been over there, but he won't open.
He won't answer the phone.
I even went to his college, but he's not been there for days.
God knows what you can do.
But, if I were Simon, I'd never forgive you.
No...
Hi.
Oh... 21 14.
I always thought it was 14 21.
I've only been getting your answering machine.
Perhaps your cell's been playing up...
Sorry.
I'm sorry...
I wanted to help you feel what it was like to be in love as you never had been.
I thought you might think it was cool.
Listen to me!
I'm apologizing!
At least you could...
HI, Simon.
It's me, again.
I would really like to talk to you, but you're not at home, or maybe you'd rather not talk to me.
Simon, I'm...
Never mind.
I'm at home.
You can call me.
Bye.
I might as well move.
Simon'II never forgive me...
Andrés may feel far off, now.
But, once you're in Paris...
Do you honestly believe I'II think anyIess about Simon there?
But you've hurt each other so badly!
It'II be good to get away, so you can long for each other a bit.
But I don't even know if I'm going.
First i want to sort things out with Simon.
And Andrés?
It's a damn pain.
Get it?
-Eh?
-What's the time?
!
Mia...
Look at this, it's way out!
I'm going...
I am going to Paris.
bella!
What's happened?
It's over.WeII, we've had a fight...
-...and Pontus, he's...
-Come inside and have some tea... ..if you Iike.
shall I see if the tea's done?
-Do you want a sandwich?
-Yes.
But...
No butter and only one cheese slice.
I haven't forgotten!
I'II see to it.
Hi, it's me.
Did I wake you?
No...
It's just that it's a bit late in the evening.
Good.
No, i was just...
I'II be there on Sunday.
brilliant.
Okay,then.
Kisses.
Bye.
Who was it?
Just my mother.
-This is cozy.
-Yeah.
-Excuse me, Micke, but...
-What?
Have you ever thought what it wouId be like if it was still you and me?
well...
I have thought about it on and off.
With Pontus it was never like it was with you and me.
-Wasn't it?
-No.
-Micke...do you know what I believe?
-No.
-This is fate.
-You think so?
We're meant to be together, you and me.
Yes.
I've missed you so much.
-I've missed you,too.
-Have you?
What do you want?
It doesn't matter where i am, as I'm not...
What?
Do you really want that?
Ooh!
You're not kidding?
Okay, I'II be there.
You are fantast...
Kisses!
I've got to go.
It was Pontus.This is crazy...
but he wants to get engaged!
"Hi, Simon, as you won't talk to me or see me" "this would seem to be the only way to get through to you."
"I'm really sorry abou thow it turned out.
It wasn't meant to go this far."
"And I wasn't meant to fall in love with you, either.
But I did."
"When I realized I was falling in love, I wanted to explain."
"But suddenly it was all too late."
"I couId understand your never forgiving me."
"You will always be in myheart."
"I won't be bothering you again.
Today I'm flying to Paris, to Andrés."
"Just as well, after all that's happened."
"Forgive me, Simon.
Mia."
"PS Don't be too hard on Micke.
He means well."
Mia.
Mia, it's Simon.
Open up!
Mia, please, open the door!
-Hey...
-What?
No point in knocking.
They're not home.
-Do you know where they are?
-Left...for Taiwan.
-When?
-An hour ago...more or less.
Damn!
-Hi...
How much to ArIanda Airport?
-I can run you out for 400.
-400?
-Yup.
Forget it!
-How are you feeling, sweetheart?
-I'm okay.
Mario.
Hiya, Simon...

Okay...
Now?

Mia!
Faster, Sanna, please!
If we don't make it...
You're only doing 20...

We're doing the best we can.
What's that?
-What are you doing?
!
-There's a queue, Simon...
I just don't believe this is happening!
For Christ's sake!
Why the hell's she moving to Paris?
could someone please explain!
-You're sure you'II be okay now?
.
-Of course i will be.
But things'II be great in Paris!
Yes, I suppose so.
I'II miss you.
I'II come and visit as soon as poss.
Hi.
Listen...
Forget that now.
Micke,we can talk later.
When's the next Paris flight?
What!
In 15 minutes?
We won't make it.
It's Mia.
Right...of course.
Listen, Simon...
We'II talk later.
Right.

-What are you doing?
-Christ!
Who's that idiot, honking?
Hey,you!
Christ, it's him!
-Hiya,friend!
-You've got to help me...

-Yes.
We'II be there in five minutes.
Jump in!

-It's the cops,for God's sake!
-But she'II be gone if we stop!
-Remember my Vinnie?
-Eh?
-The girl in the photo.
-Yes.
She vanished, because the cops stopped us.
But they won't this time!
-They're getting closer.

Just you wait!
-Move!

-But the police...
Forget it.

I thought I'd be on a flight to Geneva at 1.25 p.m.
So sorry.There's a one-hour delay.
It's fantastic for me to know you're so sorry.
Do you follow?

Knowing you're sorry will get me to Geneva much faster.
Or am i wrong?
-Get in the queue!
-slow down!
Wait here!
-Passport and boarding car...
-My girl's waiting in there.
Passport and boarding card.

-Straighten your tie.
-Next.
-Hiya!
-Hiya, mate.
-Is this the Paris load?
-Yup.
-Hi!
-Hi,there!
I found this little guy over there crying.
He must have lost his parents.
Poor fellow.
Lost your mummy and daddy?
Have you?
-No...
-Yes.
Right.They must be around.
Can you look after him?
I've got my flight.
-Gate 2?
-Right.
Come round.
There now...
What the...!
-Sorry.
I've got to do this.
-Don't close...
Open it!
It's a break-in!
Can't anyone help?
Security, come here!
God,you take your time!
-What is it?
-Break-in!
-He works here?
-No!
Come out of there!
Mia!
It's Simon.Are you listening?
I've got something to say.
I was drunk.
It was so stupid, so idiotic.
What in God's name's he up to?
Don't leave because of that, Mia!
I know I haven't answered when you've called but I've needed time.
I'm still angry with you and Micke, and you are with me.
Forget it all, Mia!
Because I'm deeply in love with you.
I realize now it's you I want, only you.
So, Mia, if you can hear me...
Don't get on that plane!
Paris isn't for you, I promise you.
We've got to give love a chance, you and me.
Mia i love you.
I want to be with you.
hollywood movies aren't like this, they don't have unhappy endings.
Great stuff, mate!
Great stuff.
-Thanks.
-You'II have to come with me.
What are you up to?
Have you gone nuts?
I'II call Micke, so he can sort it out.
Are you okay?
Simon!
Go on,feIIer!
It's cool.
-You came!
-Of course I did!
-How did you know I was here?
-I got your letter.
What do you mean?
What...?
What is it?
Great, man!
Aren't you Survivor-Micke?
-Yes.That's me.

I should think so.
-What's your name?
-Emma.
There you are, Emma.
-Thanks.
-That's okay.
Emma!
You can have this,too, seeing as I Iike you.
-There you go.
-Thanks.
Great!

Mario doesn't know about our little bet, eh?
Hello?
Who?
No.
No, this is Morvern Callar.
Morvern Callar.
M-O-R-V...
I don't see anybody.
No.
Yes, it's the station.
No, no, I'm not from here, no.
But I've lived here for years.
I was...
I was going to make a call.
Oh, don't worry.
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Yeah.
OK, then.
OK, thanks a lot.
Bye.
Oh, aye, merry Christmas.
Sorry.
- Where have you been?
I'm freezin' to death.
- Sorry.
Where is he, then?
- He's not coming.
- And why not?
He's weird.
What's that?
"Jackie"?
Who's Jackie?
- I found it.
- Lucky bitch.
It's gold.
What's up wi' you?
Here.
Take this and shut up.
OK, boys, this time we'll play you for Joan of Arc.
Hi, gorgeous.
- Hey, sexy.
- Arsehole.
When are you going to get a steady boyfriend?
Where's your man the night, then, eh?
At home.
Eh?
Don't tempt me.
Hello, Morvern.
Long time no see.
I thought you'd have been over to visit us by now.
Sorry.
What have you done wi' Dostoevsky tonight?
- He's at home.
- You leave him at home?
In the kitchen.
They'll get their heads kicked in.
Where are you taking us?
The girl's mental.
- Look at her.
- I know.
I told them my leg won't stop shaking and then they said...
"Do you want to go to the hospital?"
I said, "I don't know what to do because my leg won't stop shaking."
Is this your house?
It's a really nice house, isn't it?
I like the bath.
Reckon we can get any more?
Do you reckon we can get any more?
Do you reckon we can get any more?
I reckon he's got some.
I reckon he's got some.
I reckon he's got some.
I reck-I reck-I reck-I reckon he's got some.
I broke my nail.
Ask them, they might have seen it.
- Have you seen my nail?
- It's a sparkly blue nail.
Excuse me, have you seen my nail?
Look.
She's lost her nail.
Excuse me, everybody, but I've lost my nail.
I've fuckin' lost my nail.
No, I think you've got a nice smile.
Don't worry about your smile.
Have you seen my boyfriend?
I've lost my boyfriend.
Have you seen my boyfriend?
...when you can sit on your own and not really say anything,
I think that's when you know you really love somebody.
What are you doing out here?
It's freezin'.
Oh, shit.
How are you feelin'?
Not too good.
That's the island where my foster mum is buried.
I'm fucked.
Ooh, I need a pee.
I do.
I need it.
I need to do a pee.
I'm freezin'.
Let's go to yours.
- No, I don't wanna go home.
- I know what you mean.
A merry Christmas, hen.
Happy New Year, Gran.
It's New Year.
It's New Year, is it?
Och, I thought it was Christmas.
- I'm only winding you up, Granny.
- Ah, get off me, toerag.
Put the whistling jenny on and we'll have a cup of tea.
Right, Granny.
A three-letter word meaning um, what is it, neighbour.
Och aye.
What would we say instead of neighbour?
- Pal.
- Pal!
Three-letter word.
Pal.
That's right.
I know, Mum, but it was snowin'.
Well, Morvern's not got a phone.
Look...
Right.
Right.
Just shut up.
So what did you get me for Christmas, Granny?
What Christmas?
Thought it was the New Year.
Och, away wi' you, and have a hot bath, the pair of yous.
What are you gonna tell him?
You can tell him you crashed at mine.
Lanna?
What?
Summat bad's happened.
You're not pregnant, are you?
He's gone.
He's left me.
- What are you talking about?
- He's left me.
Oh, he's probably just in one of his moods.
He's not.
He's really gone.
He's never coming back.
He's gone where?
Gone where?
Dunno.
To another country.
Another country?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Is it something to do wi' me?
What?
I'll get some more towels, you look tired.
Are you going deaf or what?
I was buzzin' for ages.
Sorry.
- Merry Christmas, pet.
- Oh, Lanna...
I didn't get you anything.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be daft.
It's no big deal.
Come here.
And don't worry, he'll come back.
Lanna Phimister to bakery section.
Great.
I'll meet you at Menzies at nine, right?
Can Lanna Phimister please make her way to bakery section?
Don't worry, he'll be back, tail tucked between his legs.
Loose carrots 69p a pound.
Thank you for shopping at Pennysaver.
Hello.
Just get the snow off my boots.
Are you looking for Lanna?
No.
I was kind of wondering how you were.
- What are you doing here?
- Na-naa!
What?
What is it?
I booked us both a fortnight at a resort.
You're kidding?
!
Creeping Jesus will have to change your shifts.
- And don't worry about money.
- Oh, my God!
Lynn, I cannae believe it!
Morvern, you are so lovely to me!
Oh, it's all right.
It's your Christmas present.
- Where did you get the money?
- From the bank.
What are we goin' to do when we get there?
Be quiet.
It's an old woman that lives there anyway.
He's left all his stuff, eh?
Even the computer.
It's kinda creepy, innit?
Oh, my head's buzzin' wi' this tab.
- We've gotta put some music on.
- What do you want on?
Some of his stuff.
Did you know that Shadow the shelf-stacker got the boot from work?
I don't want to talk about work.
I hated him.
He's a real perv.
Let's look at some of his stuff on the computer.
- No.
- Maybe he's wrote something about me.
I don't want to.
You're a pure bore.
Let's do some hoovering'.
Oh, come on, it'll be a brilliant trip.
No.
Do you want to do some baking', then?
We got to do it right.
Oh, that's brilliant.
- It's pure dead brilliant.
- Pure dead brilliant.
It's no sticking properly to the wee pasty underneath.
Your hand's shakin'.
Cake.
It's a wee cake.
Morvern?
What?
What?
What?
You know we were pals?
What, us?
No.
Me and him.
We were good pals.
What do you mean?
You'll be in a massive huff.
Did you go with him, then?
Look, Morvern, I know how terrible it must feel to you, but it realty wasn't what you think.
I'll understand if you don't want me to come on holiday.
I'll stay here and look after the flat.
It's not that I don't want to come.
I'd love to come.
You're my best friend, Morvern.
I'm sorry, really.
I got your letter.
Um...
I'm...
I'm glad you like the book.
I can't...
I can't come and meet you in London because I'm off to Spain.
So...
Oh.
Shit.
Um...
It's the er Hotel Rozinante.
- Come on!
We're missin' the plane!
- Sorry.
Hurry up!
You're lucky to be on the flight.
Oh, wow!
This is great.
Lanna!
- What about the buses?
- We'll get a cab.
- Are the buses here already?
- No, we got a lift.
There is a special bus laid on for you, you know.
So?
Name?
Morvern Callar.
Oh, by the way, there's a message for you.
- Let me see.
- Give it back.
- "Tom Boddington."
- Give it back.
I said give it back!
There's no need to get nasty.
So who's Tom Boddington, anyway?
Just a guy I met.
Where?
- At the airport.
- At the airport?
How does he know you're here?
Cos I told him.

You're so good to me and I really don't deserve it.
- Oh, shut up.
- I mean it.
- You're such a good friend.
You're great.
- That's enough now.
And there's plenty of guys who fancy you.
You'll have no problem finding a new boyfriend.
- Who said I wanted a new boyfriend?

Have you phoned Tom?
He fancies you.
What are you talking about?

How are you getting on in there?
Nice one, Tony!
I think they've had long enough.
Drum roll, everybody.
Here we go.
And...
Look at that.
Don't they look lovely?
Beautiful.
Big round of applause.

- Do you like them?
Very nice.
I never take it off.
My hair's a fuckin' mess.
Do you like it like that?
- Does it work?
- That's much better.
It's my hat, greasy.
I don't wash it, you see.
Makes it dry.
We just got a cheap flight, didn't we?
We don't know how long we're going to be here.
We're looking for jobs.
- Do you want a job?
- Nah, you're all right.
I don't want one either.
- What's your name?
- Lanna.
Paul.
- Lanna?
- Lanna, yeah.

Lanna.
Lanna.
As in, like, Lanna the llama?
Fuckin' hell!
It's all right.
Do you...
Do you want to come to Revert with us later?
It's only down the road and it's fucking good, innit?
It's a great club.
It's got two big fuckin' rooms, right.
- 24 hours, man.
- 24 hours.
They close one room and, like, clean the other.
How can they close one and clean the other, spacker?
You're doing my fuckin' head in.
You're doing it on purpose to show me up.
I was saying summat.
Oh, Sashy!
Our fuckin' mate Sasha, man.
- He's fuckin' off his head.
- He came here for a week...
All right, mate?
Dick.
...found him a month later a month later, in The Revert, just been livin' on fuckin' orange juice and burgers, man!
He completely fried his brain.
So are you gonna come with us?
Aye, great.
You ought to.
It's gonna be a fuckin' laugh.
It just goes on and on.
You just fuckin' get smashed.
- You get some fuckin' nuts.

Think they're cute?
But I might go somewhere else.
Where's she going?
Ah, she'll be all right.
No!

No.
Are you all right?
My mum's dead.
Will you stay for a while and talk to me?
I'll tell you about my foster mum's funeral, if you like.
I've gotta go back.

- It's me.
What time is it?
Half nine.
Where have you been?
We've just taken some E's.

Get dressed.
We're leaving.

We're leaving.

- We're going elsewhere.
Where?
What are you lookin' at?
Pervert!
Come on!
What the hell is this?

Mar-way.
Where are we goin'?
Somewhere beautiful.
Oh, my God.

Lanna!
Vaya, hombre!
Lanna!
Lanna!
Lanna!
Don't like it here.
I want to go back.
Where's your case?
I don't know.
And the new bikini and everything!
I can't believe it.
That cost a fortune.
And the pink dress.
Everything.
This is too depressing'.
Wow!
This is amazing.
This?
It's the middle of nowhere.
I cannae walk.
Oh, that's a sign.
A sign for a hotel, I bet you.
- Come on.
- There's nothin' up that way.
- Come on, you.
- It's just mountains.
Come on.
Oh, I cannae walk.
My feet are killin' me.
Have you got a light?
Somethin' just bit me!
This place is crawling'.
Are you sure you haven't got a light?
You don't understand, Morvern.
We are lost in the middle of nowhere!
I want to go back.
There's nothin' wrong wi' that place.
I liked it.
I was havin' a great time.
- What?
- Did you hear that?
- What?
- There.
Look.
There's eyes.
Somebody's watching us.
This is all your fault.
Why did we have to go anywhere anyhow?
I hate this place.
Stop laughing.
It's not funny.
- You hate me, don't you?
- What?
You still fuckin' hate me because of him, don't you?
What are you talking about?
You think he's left you because of me.
That's what you think.
Shut up, Lanna.
It was just a stupid fuck.
Wasnae even a good one.
You're makin' it into some big deal.
- Shut up, Lanna.
- Just get over it,
- for fuck's sake.
- Shut up.
He's dead.
I'm sick of your stupid moods.
I mean, we could have been out clubbin' it.
Instead, we're fuckin' surrounded by donkeys and cactus.
What's wrong wi' you?
What do you want?
What planet are you on?
You're too fuckin' weird.
- Where are you going?
- Away from you.
That's my case.
Jackie.
Jackie.
A que se aparece la niña de ella que tanto te gusta.
Cémo se llama?
La que canta esa cancién...
La que siempre pone.
Mina Entrompada.
Tu te pareces a la chica de Mina Entrompada.
La conoces?
Hello?
Hello, can I speak to Tom, please?
Oh, sorry.
Tom Boddington.
Yeah.
It's Morvern.
Sorry.
Morvern Callar.
Hello.
Hi.
Yeah, I'm still in Spain.
Yeah.
One of the best first novels I've read for a while.
I really loved hearing such a distinctive female voice.
I loved just each character.
The honesty, I loved.
- Very fresh.
- It's brilliant.
It's a brave piece.
So... how are you finding it here?
Are you having a good time in Spain?
Aye, it's great, yeah.
It's really beautiful when you get to the quiet places, you know.
I like the ants.
So... tell us something about yourself.
About your background.
Well, I do books, myself, because it's got a lot to offer me.
I mean, it's much better than waking up on cold mornings knowing it's 39 years to go till pension, you know?
I mean, when you're writing, you can just... knock off when you want.
Look out the window, smoke a cigarette... then make a cup of coffee, take a shower...
Is that OK?
- Yeah, no.
Sure.
- Yeah, course, course.
Is there anyone on the business side that we should be talking to specifically?
Someone back in the UK?
Do you have an agent or someone looking after your book?
Me.
Talk to me.
- Directly.
Great.
Fine.
- That's great.
Well, um...
That's how we like it.
No agent.
Since we're talking to you directly, what did you have in mind deal-wise?
Well, shall I just put something out there?
We were thinking of something in the region of... 100?
I know it's a bit awkward talking about money.
Morvern, I'll be direct.
We love the novel.
That's why we're here.
We don't just jump on the plane to Spain at a day's notice on every unsolicited manuscript that comes through the door.
But you are a first-time writer, and we're taking a risk taking you on and you have to appreciate that.
I can assure you that for a first-time writer, £100,000 is a really good deal.
Can I go to the toilet?
Of course.
Fucking hell.
So when do I get the money?
Well, you know, these things take a little bit of time, but soon.
We have to go through lawyers, paperwork, that sort of thing.
We'll sort it out.
So how long does that take?
If you sign the contract here now, er... then, you know, by the time we get back to London, we could um... get a cheque to you immediately.
So, Morvern, are you working on any new material?
Material?
Just give us just a few words.
What are you working on next?
Hey, I'm on holiday.
Oh, come on, Morvern, don't be shy.
What's your next book about?
Sneak preview.
I work in a supermarket.
Supermarket.
Love it.
Here, take a picture.
Checkout girl.
Say cheese.
Chin-chin.
- Chin-chin.
- Chin-chin.
So, Morvern, do you really work in a supermarket?
Fruit and veg section.
No, Lanna.
Laa-nna.
Lanna Phimister.
That's right.
Yeah.
Aqualand?
Right, right.
Um...
No, I'll call back later, thanks.
No.
No message.
Thank you.
How have you been?
Same old, same old.
Back on the early shift till the end of my days.
So where did you go, then?
Oh, I met this group from Leeds.
Completely mental.
Absolutely mad.
Such a good laugh.
Oh, and I met this guy.
One of the guys from Leeds.
His name's Drew.
He's coming to see me in a fortnight.
- That's great.
- You'll like him.
He's a good laugh.
Lanna, I'm going again.
What?
Do you want to come?
Don't worry about money.
What are you talkin' about?
What money?
It doesn't matter.
And what about work?
Fuck work, Lanna.
- We can go anywhere you like.
- I'm happy here.
- Are you?
- Yeah.
Everyone I know's here.
There's nothing wrong wi' here.
It's the same crapness everywhere, so stop dreaming.
- Whisky, Morvern.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yours was...?
- Coke.
Thank you.
Ta.
I'm going to the toilet.
Hello?
Who?
No, this is Morvern Callar
Morvern Callar, M-O-R-V... I don't see anybody.
No... yes, it's the station.
No, I'm not from here, I don't know who she is.
I was going to make a call.
Don't worry, I'm sure she'll be fine
Okay then.
Thanks a lot, bye
Merry Christmas.

A busy day?
- Sorry
He's not coming Why not?
What's that?

Take this and swallow.
Okay boys, look who has come

Good to have you back

You're kidding?

You are good pal.
What do you mean?
I've been a lousy pal.
Did you love him then?
Morvern, I know how terrible it must be to you, but it really wasn't what you think.
I understand you don't want me to come for holidays.
I'll stay here and look after the flowers.
It's not that I don't want to come.
I'd love to come!
You're my best friend, Morvern.

Hello... yeah, I'm still in Spain
One of the best novels I've read for a while I really love to hear such a distinctive female voice I like the speech character
- Very fresh.
- Brilliant.
So did you have a good time in Spain?
It's great lt's really beautiful to see some quiet places
Tell us something about yourself, about your background
Well, I do books myself I mean, it's much better than to work in the cold mornings for 39 years to get your pension.
When you're writing, you just knock off on your own
Look out the window, smoke a cigarette, make a cup of coffee, take a shower.
is that okay?
Yeah, sure Of course, of course ls there anyone on the business side who we should be talking specifically?
- Someone back in the U.K.?
- Do you have an agent?
Me, you can talk to me
Directly?
Great!
Since we are talking to you directly, what do you have in mind to deal with?
We were thinking of something in the region of 100?
I know it's a bit awkward talking about money.
I'll be direct, I mean we love the book, that's why we're here.
We don't just jump on a plane to Spain at this short notice, when every manuscript comes through the door.
But you're a first time writer and as such we're taking a risk taking you on... I can assure you that as a first time writer, 100,000 pounds is really a good deal.
- Can I go to the toilet?
- Of course.
So when can I get the money?
These things take a little bit of time.
We have to go through paperwork, lawyers, that type of things.
We'll sort it out.
How long does that take?
If you sign the contract here now...
Then by the time we get back to London we'll get a cheque for you
So Morvern, are you working on any new material?

Do you know that Shadows show is up?
I don't want to know
I hate tell you that, pimp.

- You big bore.
- Come on baby, reach out.
- No.
Do some baking then?
Your hand's shaking.
- Morvern...
- What?
What?
What?
- You know we are pals.
- Of course.
You are good pal.
What do you mean?
I've been a lousy pal.
Did you love him then?
Morvern, I know how terrible it must be to you but it really wasn't what you think.
I understand you don't want me to come for holidays.
I'll stay here and look after the flowers.
It's not that I don't want to come.
I'd love to come!
You're my best friend, Morvern.
I'm really sorry.
I got your letter.
I can't meet you in London because I'm off to Spain.
It's the...
Hotel Rosanante.
Faster please, hurry up!
I didn't see you ladies.
We got left behind.
Name?
Morvern Callar.
By the way, there's a message for you.
- Let me see.
- Give it back.
Give it back.
I said give it back!
No need to get nasty.
You met the boy in England?
Just the gardener.
- Where?
- At the airport.
- At the airport?
- How did he know you're here?
I told him.
Lana Minister and Merver Callar?
For god's sake.
- Never mind, what is it?
- Good morning, Marvell.
- Have a pleasant stay, okay?
- Okay.
Speak English?
Very quiet, aren't they?
Me, Taza.
- Helga.
- Olga.
So you're German.
I know someone from Germany.
Audi Sulcher...
You know him?
Slap her.
- I like champagne.
- Me, too.
Morvern, this is great.
You're so good to me...
Oh, shut up.
I mean that, you are such a good friend.
You're great!
That's enough now
I've to give it to you, you've no problem getting a new boyfriend.
Who said I want a new boyfriend?
Like that guy Tom you met at the airport.
What are you talking about?
I'll never take it off man, it looks nice.
It's greasy I don't wash it, you see.
You're looking for jobs?
What's your name?
Lana.
Is it like Lana that llama?
You want to go there later?
It's got 3 big fucking rooms, 24 hours.
They close one room and I clean the other.
You just do it on purpose to show me you're a prick.
What's her name?
Sashi, yes, Sashi.
Living on the river, without any phones...
- What's with your friend?
- Oh, she'll be alright.
Stay for a while and talk to me.
- Who's there?
- It's me.
Will you just take some ease?
Hi, you want one?
- What are you doing?
- Get dressed, we're leaving.
Leaving?
I said get dressed, we're leaving.
Go on.
You sure you don't want a feel?
- We're getting outta here?
- We're going elsewhere.
Where?
What the hell is that?
Where're we going?
To somewhere beautiful.
Lana!
I like it here, why go back?
Where's your case?
Don't know
This is amazing.
This is the middle of nowhere.
There's a sign.
A sign for hotel, I bet you.
- Come on.
- There's nothing up that way.
Can't walk anymore.
Got a light?
Something just bit me.
You sure you haven't got a light?
You don't understand, Morvern we are lost in the middle of nowhere.
I want to go back.
I don't like this place, I'd like to have a great time.
There, look!
Somebody's watching.
Why can't we leave this place?
Stop laughing, it's not funny.
You hate me, don't you?
You still fucking hate me because he left you.
What are you talking about?
- You think he left you because of me.
- Shut up, Lana.
If it's just that stupid fuck don't you think I'll get one?
- He's just a bad deal.
- Shut up, Lana.
- Just get over it.
- Shut up!
He's dead!
I'm sick of your stupid jokes.
I mean we could have been in the club, instead of surrounded by donkeys and cattles.
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?
Away from you.
That's my case.
- Jackie.
- Jackie?
Hello, can I speak to Tom please?
Oh sorry, Tom Boddington.
It's Morvern.
It's Morvern Callar.
Hello...
Yeah, I'm still in Spain.
One of the best novels I've read for a while.
I really love to hear such a distinctive female voice.
I like the speech character.
- Very fresh.
- Brilliant.
So did you have a good time in Spain?
It's great.
It's really beautiful to see some quiet places.
Tell us something about yourself, about your background.
Well, I do books myself.
I mean, it's much better than to work in the cold mornings for 39 years to get your pension.
When you're writing, you just knock off on your own.
Look out the window, smoke a cigarette make a cup of coffee, take a shower.
Is that okay?
Yeah, sure Of course, of course.
Is there anyone on the business side who we should be talking specifically?
- Someone back in the U.K.?
- Do you have an agent?
Me, you can talk to me.
Directly?
Great!
Since we are talking to you directly... what do you have in mind to deal with?
We were thinking of something in the region of 100?
I know it's a bit awkward talking about money.
I'll be direct, I mean we love the book, that's why we're here.
We don't just jump on a plane to Spain at this short notice... when every manuscript comes through the door.
But you're a first time writer.
...and as such we're taking a risk taking you on...
I can assure you that as a first time writer, 100,000 pounds is really a good deal.
- Can I go to the toilet?
- Of course.
So when can I get the money?
These things take a little bit of time.
We have to go through paperwork, lawyers, that type of things.
We'll sort it out.
How long does that take?
If you sign the contract here now...
Then by the time we get back to London we'll get a cheque for you.
So Morvern, are you working on any new material?
Material?
Just give us a few words.
What are you working on next?
I'm on holiday.
Oh, come on, woman, don't be shy.
What's your next book about?
I work in a supermarket.
Supermarket?
I love it.
Here, take a picture.
Say cheese.
Cheers!
So Morvern, you really work in a supermarket?
No, it's Lana, Lana Flimstone that's right.
No, I'll call back later.
No.
No message, thank you.
How've you been?
Same old same old shit, buddy.
Where did you go then?
I met this guy, he's completely mad and I had a good laugh.
Then I met this guy, his name is Stuart.
He's coming to see me in a fortnight.
Well, that's great.
- Lana, I'm going again.
- Where?
To Midcombe, don't worry about the money.
- What about the money?
- Doesn't matter.
What about your work?
I quit.
I'm going to do anything I like.
- Aren't you happy here?
- Well, yes.
Everyone knows you, here.
Every place is the same, Morvern, stop dreaming.
To the toilet.
Look at that dancing doll.
Look at the way it's composing tunes.
I solved this sum by the method you taught me.
It was very easy.
There is no doll like my doll.
Sir, paper
Come and have milk and eat.
Shall I apply turmeric?
Congratulations to my friend B.P. Madhavan.
For the next business endeavour, friend who is embarking on a new journey,
Friend, we are awaiting your success
NEXT...
ENDEAVOUR...
JOURNEY..
WE'RE awaiting.
All along you taught our children without taking fees.
They were also studying very well.
Now you are leaving on another endeavour.
We wish you success in your endeavour.
Long live my son!
Come back soon.
I'm not able to hold my breath.
That's why I suggested to you to take 1/4 bottle of liquor.
You donkey!
Useless!
Damn it...
Oldie...oldie...
Can't you hear me screaming, oldie?
Haven't I repeatedly asked you, not to hang the chickens like this?
Why are you irritating me every day in the morning?
- Sir.
Will this small chicken hide such a big sun?
Oh my God.
Can I ever win you in arguments?
That's what, even I'm trying to imply.
Just the way you've kept a parrot at home, I'm keeping a chicken in my A/c outlet.
Just the way you've parked a car in the car-park, I've tied my cows in my car park.
Do we've different rights for us?
He's irritating us early in the morning...
Even if you behave properly, criticisms can't be avoided.
Education is not important, my dear.
Our family pride should be the watch word.
Do you understand?
After so much tongue-lashing, you want cow's urine, is it?
We have a naming ceremony for a child at my house, that's why.
Be careful, the cow might kick you.
Hey look, "Music" is coming.
That bloody Jackie Chang women is also a accompanying her.
Today we'll...
Oh God!
I'll slipper you, useless guys.
Try throwing this between your dad mother.
Bravo!
Hats off to that lady.
That was powerful like Saddam Hussain's bomb.
is your dignity at stake when I accompany you?
Why are you drawing a long face?
Did you see the guts of those bloody fellows?
A donkey doesn't know the value of Saffron.
Dear Deivanai, don't talk to anybody, go quietly come back safely.
I'm talking to you only.
is it difficult to say "Yes"?
Why don't you say "yes" to her?
Hey, who's that spitting on my back?
Nothing....
Sorry...
Are you trying to rub against me?
I carry a compass for guys like you.
I'll skin you guys.
Hey conductor!
You guys are increasing the bus fare.
Yet we are getting suffocated.
Why don't you run extra buses?
Even I'm getting suffocated amidst the crowd.
Why are you talking all the way?
Why are you complaining to me?
You're collecting the money, who else should be told?
Question the guy who sits in an A/c room.
Otherwise raise slogans, wave flags or organize rallies.
Instead of that why are you talking of law here?
Buy the ticket...
What is he saying?
He says he has written about this problem to the editor of "Hindu", newspaper.
Till now nearly 1000 people have written in about 100 magazines.
What is the use?
Nothing has happened.
Politicians don't have the heart to serve the people.
They've time only to amass wealth through scams corruptions safeguard it.
They have time only for that.
Give me a ticket to central.
Stop it, man.
Only when you face trouble in buses you talk about social problems.
When you get off the bus you forget it.
Don't be hypocrites.
Stop it.
You all know only to find fault with everything.
No one comes forward to challenge such issues.
The whole country is stinking with sewage water like scandals.
is there anyone to desilt the sewage?
Will you come?
..
Are you ready for it?
Barking dogs seldom bite.
Biting dogs seldom bark.
Don't crib, shut your mouths.
Don't raise...
Don't raise..
Don't raise bus fares...
Don't raise...
Don't raise...
Don't raise bus fares.
Don't raise...
Don't raise...
Don't raise bus fares.
How come transport companies lose if government runs them,
And make profit when a private firm runs them?
People who've to alight at central, please get down.
Why are you pushing me to come in the front?
Stay there itself.
Why are you pushing in this suffocation?
Somebody please take this money putitin thepiggybank .
Please, put it in the piggy bank.
Careful...
Princi, the witch.
Get lost, you old lady.
Violent granny!
violent granny!
When do we get freedom from you?
Give us in writing.
Oh Oldie!
Please give up?
Don't splutter like mustard.
When it explodes, you'll see it as bomb.
You belong to the black white era.
While we are very colourful people.
Change your eyes along with your glasses.
A dry fish can't swim.
Neither can you weave a cloth from a spider's web.
Our grandpa's horse will be of no use now.
Your days a over, oldie, get lost.
Don't withhold our money.
You'll break our dreams of desire.
We are cyclones wearing short skirt.
Oh!
Dreams!
Make way for us and get lost.
Oh Goddess!
oh Goddess!
Oh Goddess!
Oh Goddess.
-Come again?
Are you trying to back answer?
Are you trying to back answer?
Oh my dear, oh my dear.
Oh my dear...
Oh my dear...
Our era is an era of Laboratory.
Whereas yours was a troublesome era.
Your era was a palanquin era, whereas ours is a jet era.
I'm no more a kid.
I'm no more a kid nor a person to be trapped easily.
Open the door..
Open the door.
Look dear...
By trying to cheat me, you're going to cheat yourself.
Open the door... 1000 die in the Northern states due to starvation.
Will the former Minister arrested, for a food scam be released?
NORTHERN STATES.
When an individual misappropriates money for personal gains, lt affects the society to a very large extent.
This report is about that.
These cows which provide milk to the poor farmers their children,
Are being sold to slaughter houses.
Who's responsible for all this?
Cows died out of thirst hunger and became food for dogs vultures.
Who's responsible for this?
Does this tragedy only affect cows?
Haven't the humans been affected by this?
Without knowing who is cheating them, men are perishing of starvation.
Who's responsible for this?
Here, nobody seems to be bothered of anybody or anything.
In an era when there is no value for human life,
As if the death of cows will stir the hearts of people?
.
We are also living in this same land where people are perishing of starvation.
Today it is them, tomorrow it may be anybody?
It could be any of us.
Friends, lets ponder over it.
Nobody came to save us.
I just need one card to finish the game.
Haven't I told you not to come here when the officer comes?
Go that side.
What all problems are there?
Okay.
Only now the game begins, it should be played well.
Drink the milk.
Sir, 3 C.B.l officer's have come.
I'll meet them, tell them to wait.
After finishing my game I'll meet them.
Sir, they want you to come soon.
Why are you telling me again again?
I've already told you.
As soon as the game is over I'll come.
What sir?
- You pig... swine.
Greetings sir!
950 crores!
We've to enquire about that.
When we asked you about 7 files earlier, you said you haven't signed.
When you were the Chief Minister, your Home Secretary Mr. Brijesh said,
That you've signed.
What do you have to say about it?
Sir, you're sick, don't talk.
I've adviced you to take rest.
This is a political game against me.
It had originated when I was the C.M.
And it is still continuing.
I know who is engineering it against me.
What do you think?
An innocent man like me has no use for such a big amount.
I've no clue about the questions you've put to me.
You would've closed your nose with handkerchief unable to bear cow dung stink.
But we are tolerating this thing perennially.
And it has become a part of our life.
And it has entered every pore of our body.
I'm ready to give my skin to the people.
Sir, please don't talk.
I'm ready to get my skin peeled off and made into slippers shoes.
Sir, don't speak.
And you're blaming me?
Trying to get smart with me!
-Please sir, don't talk.
I've never bothered about my wife children for the welfare of my subjects.
Sir, don't speak.
You need rest.
Sir you're not feeling well.
You don't speak.
Officer, his ECG report is not normal nor good.
Please question him after he gets well.
Yes, sir.
You've come from a long distance for enquiry.
Atleast have milk go.
Oh Sreedevi, after shiting dung in the morning, you are getting excited?
Shall I get you married?
Don't know where you've the tail?
Take care of the dogs.
They may bite me.
What're you doing here?
Move away.
Have you spoiled it?
Do you think you're a M.P.?
What Madhuri Dixit, you're giving such a pose,
As if you're going to break into a dance.
What's the matter?
Why should I be angry on you, if you come early pick this.
Go....
This is the Minister's T-shirt, but where is he?
The former C.M. was kidnapped from his farm house this morning.
Former Minister of Northern India has been kidnapped in a strange way.
Police have found a tractor abandoned on the highway near the Minister's house.
They suspect the Minister could've been kidnapped in this cow dung tractor.
As you're transferred often, only once a way you come here.
Here this girl doesn't pay attention to me.
The girls in the flat have all come back home.
I don't know what is she doing there still?
If I dare to enquire, then I'll be branded as terror.
As a result of this kidnapping, Minister's supporters are agitating.
Pandi, please switch off the T.V.
The whole state is very sensitive.
It's been quite long since you're here.
Still your daughter is yet to come.
This is a daily affair.
Everyday she gives some excuse or the other.
Either she will say some guys in the auto ragged her,
Or that she had special class,
Or that she had to wait for the bus.
She will relentlessly give excuses like this.l'm not able to manage her.
There she is...
Don't pamper her as she comes in.
Take her to task.
Do you understand?
Even you ask her without being silent.
Don't fondle!
Hey, why are you late?
Daddy, granny never gave me the money you sent for my French classes.
Look at the way she is changing the subject.
You don't change the subject.
What did you do to that money?
Come on tell daddy...
tell him, you oldie.
I'll slap you... ls this the way to behave with elder people?
Mummy, daddy is always finding fault with us.
She never gives me money even to buy an ice cream.
She spends the money on buying betel leaves.
Miser lady!
Hey you are talking too much.
Come dear.
Look, how she is speaking inspite of you being here.
I'll scald you later.
Police suspect that they must've kidnapped only in the cow dung tractor.
Can you lower the volume, please?
Kindly rewind please.
This is what I had observed.
The kidnappers might have used this tube for the victim to breathe.
Maximize this and send a copy to the A.S.P who's handling the case.
Where are you posted now Pandiyan?
Otherwise can he give a clue for this case, handled by a different dept.?
Only because such people exist, public still has faith on us.
Can you connect me to Bhuvaneswar S.P.?
"Thanks for your greetings"
Journey....
Over...
Captive....
Safe...
Kind attention passengers....
Train no 6041 which goes via Salem, Trichy, Coimbatore... I'll bring her when the vacation starts.
Pandi, have a safe journey, take food timely.
Mother, give her this money from your hands, she wants to join French classes.
For what?
Inspite of attending classes during day time she comes late.
Evening class is not necessary for her.
No mother, I promise, Deiva will get back earlier.
It is always good to learn an additional language.
You should be back by 7.00 p.m, is it okay?
Here mother - l'm agreeing because you've promised.
If she reaches home later than 7 p.m, I'll show my true colours.
See you aunty, see you dear.
Don't trouble granny, get back home on time.
See you mother.
Son, call me as soon as you reach.
Stupid fellow!
Don't you know that smoking is banned in public places?
You've not only smoked cigaratte but you've also blown the smoke on this girl.
Hey police, instead of just watching, Put him behind bars.
Come dear.
Hey who are you?
You're not allowed in the 1st class compartment, get lost.
Who are you?
Why did you get into a running train?
You are a thief, isn't it?
Sir, this is unnecessary.
- Hit him .......
Sir, am I not enquiring him?
When he is enquiring, why is everybody questioning?
Sir, allow the boy to speak.
- Why are you so worried,
As if you're carrying luggages or money.
As a freedom fighter, you're permitted to travel free of cost in trains.
Shut your mouth leave this place.
Sir, check his bag, there might be a bomb.
Sir check...
He might be a terrorist also?
- Keep quiet.
Give me the bag...
take out your bag.
Look...
Check what's in his bag.
I'm not the kind of person you're thinking me to be.
In a hurry, I got into this compartment, I'm sorry.
As soon as the train stops, I'll go to the general compartment.
Trust me.
He has got a ticket, but check out whether it is for this train.
Yes, it is for this train.
Ticket!
- Now that he has a ticket, everybody clear out.
Go inside...
Go...
Always ready to abuse others.
Where's the dry fish gravy which my mother gave?
Oh god, I've forgotten it.
You'll forget everything whatever my mother gives.
Only to feel proud, we can say we've attained freedom...
Dear, what happened?
- lf anyone over eats...
Oh God, what happened, dear?
Someone please help.
- What happened?
Fast...
is there a doctor around?
Quickly call the T.T.R ...
- Be here... I'll check whether the doctor is there?
Doctor, I don't know what happened to him, he is not speaking anything.
Hey, where are you going?
Sir, attend to him...
You too...
- Leave him free.
Nothing will happen.
Don't cry.
is the patient in this compartment?
- Yes doctor.
Who gave him first aid?
We don't know who he was?
He looked like a thief.
He is the one who gave him first aid.
Your husband is alive because of the first aid given by him.
You can continue your journey.
I'll also prescribe a medicine.
Don't worry, be brave.
If a man is dirty, we immediately brand him as a thief.
We never even thanked the guy who saved this man's life...
What sort of people are we?
Mr.N.Varadarajan, A.E., Kullamalai dam, Rani malai, taluk, Melapalayam Dist.
Oh Bamboo forests.
Songs murmured by betels.
Oh waterfalls!
That starts from distant hills.
Getting separated from the lap of Mother nature,
Losing my heart over it for a life like this.
I'm fed up being human, I want to become a bird see this world,
By flying flying.
Slushy water that bears the lotus doesn't have a fragrance but the lotus has.
Even if the roots are cut off, the tree won't have animus with you.
The stream carries the flowers of the trees.
Will I become a lotus flower and attain salvation?
Will I become a tree and be a part of the human?
Or will I become a dew drop to be absorbed by the sun?
Even if clouds are formed through salt water in the sea,
The clouds does not send back salt water.
Even if the sun sets, it does not die, lt transforms as a moon stayson.
Will I become a cloud and posses that extraordinary features?
Will I become a sun and rule the world?
Will I become a rain drop unaware of life death?
That's enough, give me the newspaper.
llliterate!
Moron!
You buy paper only for packing.
What else do we buy the paper for?
Useless!
Where is Mr.Varadharajan, P.W.D Engineer's house?
Old man, whose house is he referring to?
Asking about your uncle, shut up.
Where are you coming from, sir?
I'm coming from "Kulla malai dam".
His office is there.
By mistake I went...
-P.W.D Engineer's house, isn't it?
His house is......
- P.W.!
Look if you climb go down the mount there...
First house of the two there.
A literate man has directed you, isn't it?
Proceed.
Hey, what did you say for Engineer?
- P.W?
Get lost, you stupid fellow.
Hug me..
Hug me my dear...
Hug me as you please.
I'm going to spread the cot, hug me tightly, my dear.
I don't have anybody to hug except the T.V.
Within 3 months they've separated us by giving T.V in dowry.
Akila, look how I'm managing without you.
I don't have side dish, but I'll adjust.
Oh God!
Bones!
Some bloody fellow has come for a share in my liquor.
The way he is pushing me aside, could he be a policeman?
You're barging into my house like P.K.S. Who're you?
Why are you cleaning the place?
Are you a social worker?
He is confusing me with his "Khadi" kurtha.
Who are you?
This is my wife's photograph, she is like your sister.
Who's he?
Oh God!
that is my dirty dhoti.
What do you think of yourself?
I'm going to lodge a complaint to the police.
Who do you think I am?
Hey, Chatter box!
- You're camera Thyagarajan, isn't it?
It's been so long... I couldn't identify you because I was drunk.
Don't mistake me.
I thought....
You're still the same confident type.
I was shocked for a minute.
How did you find my address?
Did our friends give it to you?
I'm very happy to see you after so many years.
Why're you wet?
Wait, get yourself wet inside also.
Original Rum!
Military Product.
You don't drink, is it?
We don't take coffee or tea in this hill station, only rum.
That too raw, to feel warm.
Look here...
After sometime, we'll feel warm.
Are our school friends, Murthy, Kumaresan Murugasen married?
It is 5 years since I got married.
My wife is expecting, so she has gone to her mother's house.
Varadha, I have some personal work here.
So I would like to stay separately.
Will I get a room here?
You want to stay separately, is it?
Don't make me angry.
Then, why did you come in search of me?
There is no point in our being friends.
You're staying with me.
It will take three months for my wife to come back.
Even I'm a bachelor till then.
So feel free to live here.
Buddy, somebody is at the door.
Let me check.
Change your clothes, you're wet.
Who the hell is banging the door at midnight?
Will he be a classmate or a glass mate?
Oh Devil!
It's me Varadha.
- Oh !
Aunty!
is it you?
I've run out of gas halfway through my cooking.
I came to you for an additional cylinder if you've.
What are you doing in the dark?
Aunty wanted an extra cylinder, that's why I'm removing this.
Tyagu, give me a hand.
Don't remove that, you might die.
Extra cylinder is over here.
Oh yes, if one is connected, other will be free, isn't it?
Since my wife isn't here...
That's why I asked you not to drink.
You've drunk it raw and you're taking my life out.
You should have it raw in the night.
Carry the cylinder carefully.
Aunty, he is my friend.
Don't mistake him to be a cylinder delivery boy.
You go forward, we'll bring the cylinder carefully.
Be careful, it is very slippery.
- You go carefully.
It won't look nice if I come inside as I'm drunk.
Kindly connect the cylinder for her.
What is this, you're cooking without cleaning the fish.
Should the fish be cleaned?
Yes, it should be cleaned.
100 preparations of fish.
I'm a vegetarian, my husband is a non-vegetarian.
Do you know it's how many years since we're married?
But he has never asked me to cook non-vegetarian even once!
Since he loves fish, I wanted to learn...
That's not difficult at all.
Just as you peel the skin of raw plantain, lt is the same with fish also.
First take the fish chop its head.
Like this...
Then, chop the tail.
Then, remove the scales like you do for a raw plantain.
- That's all.
Wash it, add 'masala' thenfryit .
Varadhan, why are you standing outside?
Come, lets go in.
Are you drunk?
- No, I smoked a cigarette.
I'll inform your wife.
- Sir don't...
Please.
Your wife is in Dharmapuri, isn't it?
I'll make a call right away.
Sir, you're staying with your wife, but I'm alone.
Does that mean you should drink?
I'm getting fish smell.
Did you take fish?
I never had anything solid, I took only liquid.
The aroma of fish is from here.
Aunty!
Wow!
A vegetarian woman has cooked non-vegetarian.
Gayathri, did you cook this?
I didn't, his friend prepared it.
Who?
- He is my friend Thyagarajan.
Don't take him to be a cook because he has cooked non-vegetarian.
We are bosom friends neighbours.
We studied together in the same school class.
He is here to meet me after a long time.
Because of his benevolence, we've non-veg. today.
I wanted to thank you there itself.
But, I couldn't find you.
Sir, I've got a job in the dam.
Do you know, what it is?
If I bring fish, crab snails for aunty,
She will cook them deliciously for us.
I'll meet you all with crabs.

Both Appa and Aatha is it?

Hey, have it, nothing will happen to you.

You've to come here definitely.
Oh God!
As soon as my grand-daughter attains puberty, I had taken a vow that I'll offer you pongal and do all the rituals.
I couldn't fulfill it.
Within the forth coming new moon I'll fulfill all the vows.
This oldie is sickening to us.
Children's education are getting spoiled.
Won't anyone of you question her?
This oldie is sickening.
She'll start fighting with us if we say something.
She doesn't have brains at all.

Without letting any evil spirits to come near her,
Without letting her to suffer from any diseases,

Because of the broken bridge, 86 people including children have died.
Sinners!
Was there any fraud involved during the construction of the bridge?
Case has been filed in the court against Ex. l.A.S officer Rajeswaran?
Don't take revenge against the officer of our caste.
Prosecution which was about to commence today against Ex. las officer,
Regarding the scam on the construction of the bridge.
On the basis of his medical report submitted in the court, I postpone this case for 15 days.
In lieu of his request in another application,
This court permits him to go out of station for Naturopathy treatment.
Why're you always postponing this case for various reasons?
Can you give us a copy of the medical report submitted in the court?
What's wrong with your father's health?
Don't disturb!
Withdraw the case against Ex l.A.S officer.
How come all the convicts have some disease or the other?
Really, can't you talk?
Answer us and then go.
What did that lady reporter question?
Hey, I can talk.
I can talk very well.
I'll put you behind bars in a brothel case.
Your family will commit suicide, be careful.
Withdraw the case against him.
Hey, phone up the Judge.
How're you Mr.Sandhana Pandian?
Has sir come?
- There he's going.
What's this?
Did he pretend in the court?
Was it a drama, sir?
Hey, why're you so dumb?
If you play ball with him... I told you about the cardamom estate, isn't it?
- Yes.
It's in this place only.
We'll go in the morning and have a look.
Sir, I'm coming.
Come...
I'll introduce you to him.
For the 15 days you're going to stay here,
He'll be your security in-charge.
Where's the A/c car?
Our lawyer has sent a car for us.
Then, what's this ambulance for?
Pandiyan, please come.
Sir, he'll do anything you ask for.
He's very good person.
That is why he has brought this ambulance?
Okay, were you posted directly or after promotion?
Why're you fighting with him on the first meeting itself?

Ex l.A.S officer Rajeswaran who had worked in many departments, ls owning properties worth millions through fraud.
Misusing his official positions in Government undertakings,
Namely construction of bridges,
He has taken a commission of atleast 20 crores...
- Hey...
There are people who are worst than us.
If we go to the north.
We may find that they've looted a sum of 900-1000 crores.
Hey, what'll they do with so much of money?
They'll fry papads, get lost man.
I'm worried when I read this.
They're going to the court after scamming on the taxes which we pay...
As if they're coming back from their concubines house,
They're giving poses in the police van happily.
You people aren't dare to question them.
But you people are kidding.
Instead of having a sickle, you're roaming with lottery tickets.
Aren't you ashamed?
Will this country get reformed?
Phew...
Oh God, what's this?
Shouldn't you be careful while working.
Please sit down for a while, you can work later.
Be quiet, we can't survive if we give importance to this.
You go and carry our child.
What happened?
- Nothing.
No need.
is this enough?
You're going to dance in my music album.
Oh God!
No...
You're definitely going to perform in my music album.
If my grandma comes to know this, that's all...
You're doing it!
I've a river, a new moon and a boat.
Who's the boat man amongst you?
I've a forest, a small hillock and a few flowers.
Who's the florist amongst you?
I've a treasure, a map and a Magical door.
Who's Alibaba amongst you?
A person who captures gives me the full moon unnoticed by me,
A person who collects and gives the songs which are unheard by me,
is it me?
- No.
is it me?
- No.
A person who ties the drenched rainbow to my lap,
A person who opens the door and window of my body, ls it me?
- No.
I'm looking for a different person, not you, get lost.
A person who knows to fulfill my unfulfilled desires,
A person who smiles even if he crosses the uncrossed limits,
A person who smiles... ls it you?
- No.
is it you?
- No.
A person who doesn't bother about chastity, eyelids and good or bad,
A person who does wonders even if I ask him to stop, ls it you?
- No....
Why isn't the handsome I'm searching for isn't here?
A river, a full moon.
A river!
My dresses are in the room, upstairs.
If you give me the keys...
Rogue.
Oh God!
What do you want?
Go out!
Go out!
Here's the bulb!
Fix it quickly.
What're you doing sir?
I had asked you to finish this work yesterday, isn't it?
I had asked him to come yesterday.
But he came only now, work is going on.
Don't give these lame excuses.
If I allot some work to you, try to execute it properly.
Don't you know they're V.l.P's?
Hey, he's calling you, go....
Not you, man...
I meant you...
come.
Between this sandal wood fragrance and this massage,
Look at the place where God has created happiness.
What father?
- Take that cigarette
What do you like to have for your dinner?
I don't want the usual chicken and mutton stuff.
Something special.
Have you ever tasted deer?
You always speak about it.
But I haven't tasted it at all.
is it?
- Today we'll have it.
Sandanam (sandal) won't suit me at all.
I'll chop it off immediately.
is it a problem if I call you just Pandian?
My son wants it, so find a young deer arrangeitwithinanhour .
Sir, you're an l.A.S officer.
You were the secretary for the Ministry of Forest.
It's a crime to slaughter wild animals.
Hey, which is a crime?
It's becomes a crime only if we file a complaint.
If 2 cars dash each other, it's an incident.
It becomes an accident only when we file a complaint.
If you slaughter the deer and prepare it,
Will the mother deer lodge a complaint?
Or, will you leave the peeled skin without burning?
Do I've to teach you all this?
Sir, this isn't fair.
Leave me!
I used to have breakfast in D.G.P's house,
And coffee in Governor's house.
Every officer will comply to my gestures.
They won't question me nor they'll stand infront of me like this.
Even after completing 20 years of service.
I don't think you're reformed.
After being posted as A.S.P.,
You've been receiving charge memos in tandem.
So you're still an A.S.P without being promoted.
Are you wondering how I'm saying your service records upto date?
That's l.A.S
Will you arrange it?
What else do you want, man?
- Liquor, father.
Hey, if I ask him to buy betel leaves.
That even includes white lime.
is he brainless?
What Pandian?
Don't stiffen up like a well starched uniform.
Stop acting smart and do what I say.
Sir, what's it?
What did he say?
Why's he coming here without going to his house?
Why's he tensed?
Sit down!
Give me a cigarrate.
- Cigarrate for you?
Give me, man.
What's it?
What happened?
Why're you in an off mood?
Even though he's an l.A.S officer, he's still an accused.
Now he's under police custody after committing frauds.
It seems he wants deer's flesh and arrack.
He's asking me!
I've bashed people who stole for their hunger.
He has swindled people's money.
But I'm supposed to serve him with folded hands.
Do I've to deserve this?
It's a shame!
I can understand your anger.
What to do?
Only because of big shots support, they're talking very boldly.
We'll feel like slapping them when they talk like this.
If you rub him on the wrong side,
At the next moment, an auto'll be parked infront of your house.
They'll pour acid on you.
They'll throw stones and bottles on you.
Atleast you'll receive a transfer order.
Sir, Don't get tensed, be patient.
What're you saying?
Do you want me to be patient?
Where's Thyagu?
He has gone to take tuitions for small children.
Who doesn't have problems?
First relax.
Who put off the fire?
I'm going to tell him that's impossible.
Let anything happen!
Hey, who's that lying on Sir's cot disrespectfully?
Get up...
Get up... 204, give me a pen.
Wait...
I'll go and come back
- Come fast.
Are you in full booze?
- l had a peg.
Who's that?
Where's your father?
He's bathing.
Hey, has Pandian brought the deer's flesh?
Hey, who's there?
What's happening there?
What happened?
- Someone...
Father.
What happened to your father?
Someone...
Father...
Soon.
Block all the vehicles which go this way.
Do it fast.
Thief cheated...
Thyagu, I received a phone call from my kinswoman.
My wife is going to deliver a child.
I'll come back in 4 days.
Police was cheated by the thief.
Brother, active and passive voice are right, isn't it?
Yes!
Where did they go?
Don't know.
Why did they kidnap him?
Don't know.
But, when asked how did they kidnap him,
You've given me the report in 8 pages.
Who needs your report, man?
It seems you weren't in the spot at that time.
Where did you go?
Sir, he...
Tell me!
Sir, I went home and...
Were you lacing your wife's in skirt at home,
Or were you playing dice?
What did you do?
Now I feel that you've some link with the kidnappers.
Sir's wife has called up from Rani malai.
It seems she wants to talk to him urgently.
Hey, I know everything.
Hey, you had misbehaved with Mr.Rajeswaran right from the beginning, ls it true or false?
That's different and this is different.
Government pays your salary,
So, be dutiful to them.
Politicians bribe you with bags of money,
So, be trustworthy to them.
Look we've to save him without even a small scratch.
This should happen.
If this doesn't happen, then commit suicide, man.
What Gayathri?
What's so urgent?
Tell it soon!
Why're you getting angry?
It seems Deiva has boarded a train last night.
So she called up on the way.
Within an hour, the train will reach here.
She should be picked up from the station, isn't it?
That's why, I called you.
What's this?
Why should she start suddenly?
With whose permission is she coming here?
Why should she come here?
I don't know the reason.
She spoke in a hurry.
I thought of asking her later, so I didn't ask her anything now.
Gayathri, I'm in a fix.
No...
She must be picked up from the station, isn't it?
That's why.
- Okay.
Give me a ticket to Cochin.
When'll the Cochin express arrive?
Journey is over.
Captive in safe custody.
Can you do me a favour?
My daughter is coming by Cochin express from Madras.
I came here to pick her up.
But I received an important message, so I've to leave immediately.
Can you pick her up and drop her home?
You've not seen her, isn't it?
This is her photo...
Have a look at her.
Come fast.
Who am I?
How are we both related?
Get down.
Get in.
Will you show me your bag?
He's friend of A.S.P.
He has come to receive his daughter.
You can carry on...
-Carry on...
Get in... I'm Thyagu, your father's friend.
He came to receive you.
He went away since he had to attend an important matter.
So he asked me to drop you in your house.
Has she arrived?
Come madam.
-Greetings.
Shall I arrange for a Jeep?
No need. lt's okay.
-Okay.
You were on duty last night isn't it?
-Yes sir...
How could've they escaped without your knowledge?
I swear, I don't know anything.
I was fast asleep.
Tell me the truth.
-Don't beat me.
I'll break your legs.
Tell me... I'm telling you the truth.
-Tell me..
Won't you tell me or not?
-Tell me...
Sir, phone call from D.l.G.
What did I tell you?
And what're you doing?
Sir, I've got a small clue from...
Hey, have you arrested anyone?
No Sir.
I'm receiving faxes from higher officials.
What happened to the enquiry report?
I'm preparing the report based on the information I've got.
Shut up.
Come to my office immediately with the report.
The report is not yet complete.
I've got a new clue...
Hubby....
Hubby, look at her.
She's gloomy since she came here.
Ask her, what are her problems?
Why're you walking out while I'm talking?
What important work do you've?
What do you think of yourselves?
She'll do anything she likes.
Am I in a position to listen to your problems?
Hey, what's the problem between you the old lady?
Why don't you both adjust with each other?
Won't you listen to your elders?
After hurting that old lady's feelings,
Has she come here to attend any funeral?
If she had died on the way, I would've performed her obsequious.
What kind of a girl have you given birth to?
Are you behaving like a father?
Why do you need a wife daughter?
What're you going to achieve by working like this?
Hey, what're you talking?
Leave me...
No...
No...
Leave me, Thyagu.
What's this, why're you beating her?
It's wrong.
What can I do, Thyagu?
Someone has kidnapped the Minister.
If I catch him, I'll....
But before that, higher officials are torturing me.
Should I answer them or should I solve her problems?
Each one of them are making me to...
When a volcano erupts few flowers will get burnt.
Burnt flowers will become manure for the new plants.
When we are destroying the polluted forest which ruins our country.
Bird's nests will also be destroyed and it can't be avoided.
It's injustice if we hesitate.
Leave me alone.
If you've come here only to cry.
I'll wait.
Finish crying.
Who are you?
Why should I tell you about why I'm here and what I'm going to do?
It's my wish to live or die.
What do you know about me?
I know.
I've seen you before.
I know the punishment you gave to the person who brushed you in the bus.
I had also seen your mischievous acts.
I had also seen you giving charity when others were not bothered.
That was the real Deiva.
You are not what you were.
You've some other problems.
I don't know what it is.
You are unable to tell your problems to others.
But, you've come here only to reveal them.
This is not the place or time for that.
Come, we'll go home.
I don't know whether my problem will be solved if I tell you.
But, I feel like telling you.
Me and Vishal from French class...
Why're they lying like this?
Nothing happened, isn't it?
Why're you making a mess of it?
Yuck!
My father, mother grandma wanted me to study well come up in life.
But I...
What can I do?
What're you crying for?
You shouldn't cry.
There's nothing wrong if we wish to walk on mountain paths.
It's idiotic to wish that there should be no thorns.
They will be there.
We breathe in Oxygen breathe out dirt.
This is the process of life.
Both are necessary for our survival.
Every experience we've in our life is a test.
Each of it will teach us a lesson.
We must feel happy, if we get good experience.
We must get matured when we face worst experience.
This has made you to understand your strength.
It made you to know about your culture.
You must thank this experience.
But you shouldn't cry, Deiva.
Grandma...
-Dear.
Why did you leave me come here?
If I had committed any mistake...
-Oh No!
I had committed the mistake.
-Oh No!
I had committed the mistake.
Come, we'll go in.
I've come, isn't it?
Grandma, I won't do like this hereafter.
Are the bells ringing in my heart?
is it a snow fall in my heart?
Electricity is passing through a tender flower.
And swallowing me
There is no sweet pain like this.
But still there's no way we can lie.
Who is playing saxophone in my heart?
Who first opened your heart?
is he a young lad pinching my heart?
is he a thief stealing my eyelids?
is he an artist who adds colours to my dreams?
Planets are revolving around the universe.
When you think of me sufferings disappear.
The report on the sample flesh given to the lab, has come.
Based on tissue analysis, it is said that he would be between 25-30 years.
Then, his blood group is B +ve.
What happened to Mr.Rajeswaran's report?
-His blood group is A +ve.
After studying the report of the kidnapped people.
It is confirmed that many cases are pending against them.
Not only that, all 6 people have been jailed in some cases.
But, they've escaped by filing appeals in the High Court.
I think that this strange way of kidnapping will continue.
One way to catch him is with the help of evidences.
Another way is to lay a trap.
I've collected a list of Politicians who are dodging the court.
Ex-Health Minister Mr.lnbaraj is popular in all medias.
This is also a guess work.
How can we be so confident that he'll be their next target?
Sometimes guess may become a trap for them.
Where is Mr.lnbaraj now?
He is in Kovai Pudur Government Hospital.
Look Rajamanickam...
You must sign these documents, if I have to escape from this case.
For how many days can I be in the hospital with my wife concubine?
If I say that my health is not good, no one is believing me.
If I become the Managing Director of your company..
I must answer all the charges against you.
You'll come out of jail.
But, Police will arrest me only.
If I'm sentenced for 3 years in this case..
...I can't contest this elections.
I made you Dean..
If I win become the minister, you'll be the Health Secretary.
Sign it.
If I don't contest this elections All the pending cases will be foisted on me and I'll be jailed.
Please, don't put me trouble.
I'll definitely win the elections and become the minister.
It's my responsibility to bring you out absolve you from all cases.
Please leave me.
Leave me.
Malar, why is he doing like this?
You were an ordinary Doctor..
But my husband made you a Dean, isn't it?
Sign it.
You must be...
Save me...
Hey, it's enough...enough.
Remove it.
Don't kill me, I'll sign it.
You unnecessarily tensed me up.
Sign it.
My blood pressure has raised because of you.
Hey, give him first aid and drop him in our car.
Go.
Who are they?
They're touring all over India for world peace.
They've come to our city today.
If they travel through mountains, will they get peace?
Hit me...
Hit me... I'm telling you to hit me, isn't it?
Hit me...
Hit me....
We're unable to tolerate this.
Don't cry.
Kavitha told that Samurai's don't cry.
Hit me..
Hit me.
Every blow i bear is to strengthen my will.
Hit me....
Hit me.... lt's very painful.
No good work can be done if we bother about pain.
No good work can be done if we bother about pain.
Buddy, they're beating the drums from morning, who's dead?
Not dead. lt's our leader's birthday.
Buddy..
-Happy birthday, buddy.
I'll pick you up after the film.
Keep quiet.
Even, she could've bunked classes like others, isn't it?
But, she has come here asking me to take the class.
I'm watching you for the past 4 years.
You're going on a separate path.
You're not coming with us anywhere.
Are you the only one who has come to study?
Have we all come to work as labourers?
Don't laugh.
Look, you'll get lost if you go separately.
Leave it, buddy.
You always keep talking about her.
Give me a cigarette.
Hey, you should go ask her.
-l'll smash you.
Kavitha, don't you know about his character?
It was his birthday yesterday.
He took us to a movie to celebrate it.
Why didn't you come for that also?
That's why, he is angry.
"Birthday wishes to Thyagu" from Kavitha.
You're nearly fulfledged Doctors.
Life is a wonderful thing.
In this world...
Rich Poor, Friends Enemies are...
Two things that don't differentiate between...
Life Disease.

At the same time, new diseases are also emerging.
So, you must be always alert and upgrade your knowledge.

Does she have to do that?
-Yes.
What "Yes"?
Why did you give charity?
If you were really concerned..
You should've given charity when that girl asked for it.
Or, is it because you consider Kavitha as your friend?
Or you should've told her that you won't give charity for this?
Forget it, buddy.
Give me a cigarette.
Are you my friend only for this cigarette or,
Are you asking cigarette to be my friend?
Buddy, if I ever asked you for a cigarette.

If you had kept to yourself, will such dogs dare to touch you?
Mind your business.

You got into trouble because of me, isn't it?
No good work can be done if we feel the pain.
Since your medicines sub-standed,
Government has stopped approving them.
How can you expect me to buy them?
Don't put me in trouble.
Take them back.
Why're you getting tensed?
Our brother will call you.
Don't cry.
It's alright.
Have it... ls it Rajamanickam, I'm Minister lnbaraj speaking.
Greetings Sir.-Greetings.
Have my boys come there?
2 people have come from Raj Pharma company.
I'm the main partner of that company.
Wherever they want your signature, sign it.
Your company doesn't have drug control license certificate.
Why did I made you as the Dean of Medical college?
is it to question me?
No sir, there shouldn't be any problem...
Do what I say.
Sir, sign it with green ink.
We must be very particular in casting bogus votes.
This is the problem, isn't it?
Affix the seal here. lt's alright.
Affix the seal.
What's it brother?
We're unloading.
Okay.
See you, sir.

Which standard are you studying?
Do you know Rhymes?
Tell me.
Continue...continue... lt's paining.
-Really!
You must get cured, isn't it?
Come, dear.
Which class are you studying?
I'm not studying.
Then, what are you doing?
I'm working in a mechanic shed.
How did you get injured?
The owner asked me to get spanner.
He kicked me when I was searching for it.
I fell on the bike the silencer scalded.
Owner has given me only one day off.
I must go to work.
When'll you discharge me?
You can go when your wounds get healed.
Give him Dextrose.
Do dressing in the morning evening.
- Okay.
What's your husband doing?
-She can't talk.
One day my father drank stamped on her throat.
Nerve got cut.
She can't speak from that day.
Forget it.
My owner will cut my salary.
When'll you discharge me?
Turn that side.
Did you eat?
They didn't give me since I had no money.
Why should you give money?
Everything is money related here.
What's this?
What have you given me?
Everybody has give Rs.5, but you have given me Rs.2.
I must put this in the dust bin.
What?
Why haven't you given this patient anything to eat?
I'm calling you only.
Am I taking the whole lot?
Shouldn't I've to give share to others.
Mind your business only.
It's okay, leave that.
Get up.
Milk given here is not good.
Doctor has told to give Horlicks Complan, isn't it?
Ask father to buy me Horlicks.
Oh!
Leave it.
Have it.
No thanks.
You eat.
Eat.-No thanks, you eat.
Take this.
Give this to eat.
He shouldn't have empty stomach.
Sister...
What's it?
-What's your name?
Thank you very much.
Smile.
You can go home very soon.
Buddy, look at that parrot there.
Make fun of him.
I'm not feeling well.
I'm not feeling well, sir.
-Come here.
They're not allowing me to take the tablet.
These boys are a big trouble.
What?
Not feeling well.
-Who?
You or parrot?
Me!
Then, why did you bring the parrot?
You spoiled my livelihood that day also.
Just like this, you had come to the station also, that day.
Were you also not there?
Why do you come wherever I go?
Are you coming to the place where l go?
Or else, am I coming to the place where you go?
Bloody!
Allow me to earn my livelihood.
Hey!
It's time to go to ward.
Come, let's go.
Greetings Madam.
Where's Rajendran?
Gone
Discharged?
Dead.
Body has gone to mortuary.
Where's Rajendran case report?
It's here, Madam.
How?
-l don't know.
Doctor, Rajendran, a 12 year old patient...died...
Look at the reason in the report, for his death?
Look.
It's written as sudden fits.
No, Doctor.
There's no chance for him to get fits.
He was a healthy boy.
Last night he was given dextrose.
The problem was in that only.
Look at this, how contaminated it is.
He got fits due to contaminated dextrose.
Mano, call immediately someone from her batch.
-Yes sir.
Death in a hospital is a natural thing.
This is not a natural death.
We've taken a life by injecting poison in the name of Medicine.
He has died because of this only.
I've seen his body.
It has turned blue.
We mustn't leave it.
We mustn't spare the supplier.
Only one inquiry will reveal the truth.
You're going on accusing.
Never heard of it.
We've never brought any item for our hospital from this place.
Patient's relatives may've brought this from elsewhere.
Are we responsible for it?
I'll enquire from the duty officer as to what happened?
I'll ask him to submit the enquiry report.
Just now, you had accused that this hospital is responsible for all this.
Don't say like that outside.
Come in.
Your friend has faced a death for the first time, isn't it?
It's not a death. lt's a murder.
I told you that I'll make an enquiry.
They're charging me of corruption.
Can they prove it?
Ask...
-Sir, a phone call for you.
I'm lnbaraj speaking.
What's the matter?
A few patients died after administering medicines supplied by you.-Really?
!
Save my ass, sir.
You do one thing.
First clear dispose all our company's products.
I'll send my men.
-Okay sir.
What were we discussing?
-Corruption sir.
Oh!
Yes, corruption.
-Corruption is there.
I'm asking you...
Jayakumar, look.
Dean said that they'll never buy any product from Raj Pharma.
Then, what's all this?
Then, Dean is also involved in this.
If we're buying from Raj Pharma,
Then, entire batch of this supply would be contaminated.
Don't know how many patients have been given this?
A mistake has been committed.
A mistake on a large scale has occurred.
Oh God!
First, we must go to store room and stop the supply immediately.
Make it fast, load it quickly man.
I'm loading it...
I'll come immediately.
Brother.
-Don't know what when to ask?
-Get lost man.
To which wards have you supplied Saline bottles of Raj Pharma.
Raj Pharma?
We never buy any medicines from that company.
I know that.
First check the stock.
Why're you ordering me, Madam?
Look at this....
We're buying all medicines from here only.
Don't argue any further, go away.
Elder man!
What's this, there are many deaths today?
Don't know.
What's happening here?
May be they had consumed spurious liquor.
Who knows?
They appear to be healthy.
Don't know what's the problem.
Does Thyagu know about this?
He is in the hostel. I've sent for him.
I don't want anything.
What a treacherous plan has been executed here.
That Dean who had stressed about this profession as being a divine service, ls involved in this.
What can we do?
We're just House Surgeons.
We're under Dean's control.
We can pass MBBS only if he gives us a certificate.
If we autogonize him, we'll be jeoparding our future.
There's some truth in what Kavitha is saying.
Some big mistake has been committed.
Ignoring it, we're...
She's blabbering in emotion.
Why're you talking like mad?
Why to poke nose in unnecessary things?
We must concentrate on our studies only.
is this our job?
An injustice has been done in front us.
You all are so insensitive towards it.
You all are talking about your personal problem.
No Kavitha, try to understand, what I'm saying.
Leave it.
Don't try to convince me.
Let Thyagu come.
Let Thyagu come.
A small boy.
Stop crying. I know everything.
You know, isn't it?
We're treating people having faith on the medicines of this hospital.
But, there is some mischief in it.
Right from the Dean, everyone is committing mistakes.
They're not coming with me to enquire.
We must enquire.
Whom will you ask?
Tell me, whom will you ask?
We'll seek justice from Secretary Minister of Health.
Do you know who's the Minister of Health?
The original proprietor of Raj Pharma is this supplier of this hospital.
If you start making enquiries, it'll lead to witch hunting.
Then, are you also suggesting to drop this issue here itself?
What else can we do?
Everyone knows about all the corruption going on here.
They've turned a blind eye to it and become insensitive to it.
Only you're trying to seek justice change.
Stop this job of changing the world.
It'll be like this only.
Endure it and carry on living.
How can we endure all this Thyagu?
Blood from his wound didn't even stop flowing.
Even you're not able to understand me.
Understand, what I'm saying?
Now, you're crying.
Will you be crying all the 24 hours?
Look, every man can't be in the same emotional condition all the time.
Think about it, you'll come to a decision.
Sister, I don't have any great wish.
Somehow I must make her talk.
I'm ready to spend any amount for it.
To make her talk, I'll run a mechanic shop foot the bill.
Why don't you say something sister?
Okay.
Thanks, sister.
The corruption which is taking lives is happening before us.
How can I turn a blind eye to it?
Has everyone's heart become so insensitive that even a death can't move it?
I can't be like that.
I'm not worried about cowards but even a brave man like you didn't question!
...And tried to pacify me I'm not able to bear it Thyagu.
Though you've bad habits of a common man,
You're a good man, Thyagu.
A great warrior who can't even act like a coward is called as Samurai.
You're one like that.
If you start seeking justice, thousands will follow you.
I've to climb 3 floors to cigarette.
Buddy!
Did you get drunk last night?
Without coming to room, you slept here only.
It seems Kavitha didn't come to Hostel last night.
Okay, I'll go, it's getting late.
What happened to you?
Are you still thinking about it?
What's the relationship between you and the persons who died?
Thinking about person totally unconnected to you, you had a sleepless night?
Why're you sitting here like a mad girl?
Who's he?
Your brother?
Without eating anything.
First drink this.
Will you seek justice only if you're related to the victim?
I'll make you seek justice.
Please give that plate.
Grandma, give me 2 "ldlis".
Grandma, I'll come back pay you.
Please come save her.
-Give me.
Shut up..shut up.
You did all this.
Why're you torturing me?
I can't bear it any more.
What am I going to do now?
Why all this is happening to me?
Who's Thyagu here?
It's me.
My Kavitha...!
Why Kavitha?
...
What am I to do now?
Why're you crying?
Why did you do like this?
I'm not able to bear this.
Who am I?
What is the relationship between you me?
Do you've to resort to this to make me understand.
You're my life.
You're only...!
Then, will you stand for justice wherever a crime in committed?
You must seek justice.
Will you do it?
You mustn't cry!
You mustn't cry!
You're a Samurai.
You'll seek justice.
You'll?
Sudden turn in Medicine Company's corruption case...
Who owns Raj Pharma?
Will former Health Minister lnbaraj be released?
Only we are working under the Law but look at these people.
Missing.
Look at this advertisement.
Neither there's a photo nor there are clear details.
Next week in our lives after the operation.
With Govt.'s help you definitely promised to meet at the Hospital.
I read the sentence leaving words defaced by coffee.
Listen.
Next operation at Govt.Hospital.
We'll meet definitely.
Come without fail.
If we read leaving a word we get a clear meaning.
Isn't it?
Aged 51 years.
...lnbaraj.
'lnbam'....
Santhosam(Happiness).
...lnbaraj, he's also 51 years old.
...5 feet 9 inches.....wheatish complexion.
This is the method of communication of the kidnappers.
Where are you sleeping?
Get up.
In the name of Holy Christ...
What's your name?
Age?
-45 years.
What's your problem?
It seems you're making plenty of money with a new CT scanner in your clinic.
Brother, where shall we put this body?
Why're you torturing me for a corpse not worth a penny?
Put it somewhere inside.
It's paining....
Doctor, it's paining.
I'm Inspector Selvamani speaking.
What are you doing there?
I've been calling you for a long time.
Can't you attend the call?
Sir, I was on rounds.
No one should get suspicious when I talk.
So, I've come to a secluded place to talk to you.
Okay!
Now what's the position there?
Nothing suspicious till now!
Our people are keeping vigil all over the hospital, as Doctors ward boys.
We're following all your instructions to the letter.
I've given instructions to all the Hospital staff.
In room No:312 of lnbaraj, all our people are waiting fully prepared.
We'll catch anyone entering in any disguise.
Be alert like this. I'll call you every 5 minutes.
Hey!
This phone is not working.
Change the batteries.
-Yes, sir.
Why're you torturing me like this?
I'll get out of this case.
All this hospital drama is for a day or two.
You're shifting my room and torturing me.
Give your phone.
All this is for your security only.
Bloody security.
Don't we know about your security.
When a person blasts himself with a belt bomb.
lmmediately, you'll start checking only the stomachs.
If another comes with a bomb tied to his leg, you'll leave him.
After the murder...
You'll protect the murder spot heavily.
Look, I know about my security.
You worry about your job.
My calculations never go wrong.
Today, I'll catch them.
Hey, you go that side watch.
...I'll go this side.
Didn't you get a wheel chair?
Doctor had advised to walk...
-ls it?
Be careful!
Please!
- Not able to.
Oh God!
I must stop the gang from entering here.
Yes...yes...
It's confirmed on 3rd.
Tell me, why're you here?
How many people have come here?
Tell me.
You came to do something with the AC.
What's that?
Come on speak up.
Take this...do it..
do it man.
Check what's it?
Police have hidden lnbaraj and laid a trap for us.
You go away.
Then, you?
-l'll escape somehow.
I'll say we'll link Ganges Kaveri that's all, isn't it.
I'm calling from dig's Office.
is Ex-Minister lnbaraj there?
What were you doing there?
How could they enter such a heavy security cordon?
Close the hospital.
-Not a single patient should come in or go out.t.
Check everyone.
Okay, we'll round up everyone.
...ASP is on the way.
Thyagu is signaling something.
See, what's it?
It seems we must reach in 5 minutes.
Go.
Close the gate.
Look up there!
There's some one there...go quickly.
When I was talking to you from mortuary, someone attacked me.
Don't give me silly reasons.
Change the department and join elsewhere.
We've planted a bomb in your hospital.
It'll go off in another 5 minutes.
If possible, save lives.
This may be Thyagu's plan.
To facilitate us to do our job easily he would've done something.
Come, fast.
Show your slip.
Take it.
Go to room no:8.
-Where's it?
It's opposite only.Look.
-Okay.
Sir, I've been standing since a long time, my legs are paining.
Wait, let the patient come out.
Hey, leg pain!
You go in.
What happened?
A small accident.
That's why...
I came to consult a Doctor.
Okay.
Have they kidnapped lnbaraj from Sooriya Hospital?
Come in Varadan.
What do you want?
Thyagu has hurt his leg.
Oh God!
-Give me tincture or any ointment if you have.
We don't have English Medicine.
Wait, my mother-in-law might be having some medicine.
She knows about country medicines.
I'll send her.
Okay.
What sort of treatment they give in Hospitals?
They'll forget a scissors inside and stitch it.
If we enter the hospital in one piece, they'll send us handicapped.
Look!
Even for this wound they've medicated it superficially.
How did you get hurt so severely?
How could that slippery mount know that he's a great Nature Lover?
He got into the mount to take photographs.
He slipped fell.
...And broke his leg.
Who plucked the wild flower?
Who removed the stalks?
If I given medicine, even a corpse will come to life again.
You're the one who stays with him, isn't it.
-Yes.
At midnight you must medicate him like this again.
Okay.
The medicine will dry off.Peel it off and put the way I'm putting it.
Understood?
One who tied the Sun of the Sky in her single plait.
One who stuck stars in her head jewellery.
I'm the one who applied volcanic Lava as henna.
I'm a twig which has entangled your body.
I don't know what I desire.
I'm a parrot who will eat you in small bits.
is it my desire to fondle you?
You're the one who tied the Sun with your single plait.
You're the one who stuck shining stars in your head band.
You're the one who applied volcanic Lava as henna.
Oh!
Twig who has entangled my body.
I don't know what's your desire.
Dear!
You're the parrot who eats me in small bits.
Do you desire to kill me?
In the Love feast, we are the food.
You can find strange things here.
Food eating food here.
In interpretation of Love, earth is different.
In winter it'll be hot, ln summer, it'll be cold.
These strange things can be seen here only.
As the warmth for your chillness burn me often.
My sword will find peace by getting drenched in your sweat.
One who forgot love.
One who went beyond desire.
One who gave up sainthood achieved heaven immediately.
Why're you hiding from me?
Even if you go to Tora Bora Carves I'll come after you.
If I leave you, where can I go?
I'll hide myself in the lines of your palm.
Even after falling in love!
Why're you playing hide seek?
If you find me out, love will rule after that.
Plucking the sword from my hand, you're placing the flowers.
I've some peace on getting this warrant.
I'm a Dam Engineer.
But there's no one to give me even a glass of water.
Shall we go?
Come.
I'll stay here only.
Take the keys.
Shall I go?
Won't you ask me, why?
I know whatever you'll do, it'll be for good only.
I'll not ask.
I'll not ask.
I'll come back soon.
Tissues collected from the rope car.
And the tissue collected from hospital yesterday.
Belong to same person.
Both match perfectly.
Can you say to which part of the body these tissues belong to?
..From the knees.
In the tissue given by you, there was a strand of Jeans pant also.
Hey you applied medicine to the knees of the people
Between the age group of 25-30 Do you remember their faces?
No, sir, since there will be heavy rush.
I'll first see the slip given by the Doctor,
Second, I'll see the wound.
Third, I'll apply medicine to the wound.
Where are those slips?
-They're here only.
The hand writing here doesn't belong to any of our hospital's Doctor.
But, definitely this is a Doctor's hand writing.
Sir, there's no name of Thyagu in this register.
Dear, our Deiva is missing.
Deiva?
I searched her everywhere.
She's missing.
Deiva missing?
What happened Deiva?
Where's Thyagu?
Thanks for all your help.
I'm leaving.
The one going there's Thyagu.
-Deiva stop.
Why did you come here?
-To see you.
You've seen me, isn't it.
Go away.
Why do you hate me?
Why do you always move away from me
Don't ask me anything.
First, go away from here.
Please don't ask me to go away.
I'll come with you.
What?
Love?
!
What do you know about me?
I know you're a good man.
What else?
I know you're a good man.
What else do you know about me?
I know you're a good man.
Have you gone mad?
Who's this Kavitha?
Don't look at me like that Deiva.
Don't look at me like that.
Many things which I couldn't feel when Kavitha was alive.
She made me understand them by giving her life.
You know only one side of my face.
Your father is after the other side of the face.
I'm like fire.
You're trying to come under it mistaking it for shadow.
It's impossible.
Father!
Don't move.
Who are you?
What have you done to the people whom you've kidnapped?
Tell me.
Did you kill them?
Come one...speak..speak...
Won't you speak?
You'll go on kidnapping people.
Do you want us to watch all the fun like kids?
Speak man!
Otherwise, you'll become dumb forever.
Why're you staring?
Now, you'll speak.
Did you ever interrogate anyone for corruption like this?
I'm D.G.P speaking.
Did you interrogate him?
Did he say anything?
We are interrogating, sir.
C.B.l officers are waiting here.
Bring him immediately to Chennai.
Just now, he started telling...
Just follow my order man.
Put him into the vehicle.
Move...move...move.
What are you looking at?
Take the camera and take out the roll.
Mask his face and get him into the vehicle.
Go back.
Look, how happy these people are?
Why're you like this?
I'm like this because I want to see everyone as happy as these people...
Father's name Nallamuthu Swamy.
Mother's name Annakameshwari.
Doctor, tell me, why did you kidnap all these people?
What do you want?
I want justice.
I want justice.
For the people I had kidnapped, I want judgement for their corruption cases.
..And I want maximum sentence.
...And lt should be given by Supreme Court Judge only.
The proceedings should be infront of Media public.
If you arrange for all this.
I'll hand over the kidnapped people myself.
There are many cases on each one of them.
Each case is in a different stage of enquiry.
Suddenly if you ask Supreme Court to interfere judge it immediately.
is it possible?
It must happen.
It must happen.
What I'm asking is not for my own self.
But, for those innocent people.
Who have always been victims of your injustice corruption.
Not for me.
I'm ready to wait till you arrange for this.
Till then, you will not know the whereabouts of the kidnapped people.
Get ready.
Delhi!
we must praise that man's courage.
Whatever he has done, he is right.
Mumbai!
Every village must have such a man.
Bangalore!
we'll get justice only when such people exist.
Hyderabad!
what he has done is right otherwise we'll not get justice.
Kidnapper Thyagu's condition.
Here a man is emotionally insistant to wipe out corruption.
Yesterday, a Minister in an interview says corruption is a normal thing.
Will he accept if we catch his wife's hand say it's natural thing?
That's why, he's giving such interviews.
Only a youth can speak so bravely.
Our support is for Thyagu only.
Our country will reform only if many people like him do it.
You're realistic.
Terrorist Thyagu gets public support.
A special programme on it.
Do you feel it is justified what Thyagu is asking?
What he's asking is absolutely justified.
I'm going to file a pil in Supreme Court seeking justice.
They're accusing him of kidnapping.
Did he smuggle Gold or diamonds?
Did he, kidnap any girl?
Did he kidnap a little child?
He has kidnapped only cheats.
Why're you spending lakhs for a Councillor Ward's Election?
To serve public?
Will he keep quiet after spending so much money?
He'll rob in crores.
We can't expect justice from them.
If we ask mildly, will the peacock give a feather?
We must pluck it.
What do you want from us?
Someone has come to seek justice.
Even if you arrest us, we'll support him only.
If Govt. doesn't accept his demands immediately...
We'll fight for him.
Thyagu is seeking justice so, we support him.
We just talk about justice, someone is doing it in deeds.
He's a great man!
A sudden turn has taken place in Thyagu's case.
Supreme Court has received 1 7 PlL's in support of Thyagu's wish.
Following which Supreme Court has constituted a 5 Judge Enquiry Commission.
It's reported that Thyagu will be presented before this 5 Judge Commission.
Who's he?
An orphan!
He's threatening a Govt.
Without getting truth out of him by torturing him.
Will you accept his demands?
I feel ashamed.
If you can't, leave him to us.
We'll take care of him.
I can understand your anger.
Don't forget he still holds 7 lives.
Then, will Judges pass judgement accepting his demands?
Do you want us to accept?
We won't accept.
They can't pass judgement.
Even if they pass, don't think this Govt.
Will be a mute spectator.
Whether Govt. be a mute spectator or not.
We'll not be.
No...
No.
You keep quite, Mother-in-law.
Let me see, what she'll say.
I want to see Thyagu.
Do you insist on seeing him?
Will you die if you don't meet him?
Will you die?
I would've died...
Mother I would've died.
When no one listened to my problem that day.
Only he listened.
Dear...my daughter.
He's a good man.
Accept Thyagu's Demands.
Long live Thyagu.
Long live Thyagu, who fights for justice.
We'll wipe out corruption.
Long Live Thyagu.
Accepting my demands.
Judges, TV Press people general public who have come here.
My heartful thanks.
I'm one amongst you.
Why should I be standing as a kidnapper before you?
What connection do we've with the people, kidnapped?
We too were thinking like you that Politics corruption is not our concern.
Only after losing few lives because of that corruption.
We were forced to interfere.
Getting fed up with all democratic ways of protest, fast, Rally, etc.
With no other option...
We chose this way.
You promised to handover the kidnapped people.
Where are they?
You say that you'll sentence them to death.
I'll hand them over immediately.
I'm seeking justice for the murders under the garb of corruption.
When bridges, buildings fall down people die.
Isn't there corruption behind those deaths?
For Bank scandals, farmers committed suicide with their families.
Isn't there corruption behind those deaths?
Police who give bribes to Ministers allow the brewing of spurious liquor.
This society has been facing them regularly.
Spurious liquor deaths.
Isn't there corruption behind those deaths?
In a country where 2 lakhs people are buying cell phones every month.
Thousands are dying because of starvations.
They didn't die in cyclones or of, disease or of hot sun.
They're dying out of hunger.
Isn't there corruption behind these starvation deaths?
Innocent patients die because of adulterated spurious medicines.
Isn't there corruption behind these deaths?
What's wrong in calling the corrupt people as killers?
Who are the 7 people kidnapped by us?
All people who embezzled crores of rupees.
All people were proved guilty sentenced by Courts of Law.
But, to put a stay to the judgement appealing in higher courts.
And using all loop holes in the Law for their own benefit.
They're people who were roaming freely in public.
People are enraged seeing all this.
The punishment you give must be the highest punishment.
If you do support corruption No, adjournments.
Only Death!
they must get this message.
No court.
They must understand, it is grave yard only.
Your judgement must instill such a fear in them.
You must punish them with Death, as expected by these people.
Law can't act like an emotional individual.
Even if their accusations are proved...
As wished by you, law doesn't have a right to punish them to death.
I know that the existing Law doesn't have that rule.
We can save this nation from corruption only if we have such a law.
Our Politicians should enact such a law.
But, those who enter politics to make money.
Why'll they make such a Law?
After getting arrested, they stand infront on the court.
Without a crease on their shirt.
Shamelessly blatantly they call it an act of political Vendetta.
is he going to change the Law?
They complain of chest pain get admitted in a hospital.
And get a postponement.
They change, threaten bribe the court officials cheat justice.
Are these politicians going to change the law?
These people's blood dries up they aren't worried about heat, cold rain.
They earn money by working as labourers in forest on road in factories.
The milk that they buy for their children
Rice, pulses, kerosene, chilly salt tamarind which he uses,
The water which quenches their thirst,
And the loin cloth which protects their honour.
They're paying tax to the government throughout their lives.
But the politicians become corrupt rob that money with ease.
They buy properties in outside the country.
And empty the treasuries.
Not only put the burden of price hikes on people.
They file cases of corruption on one another to prove that they're innocent.
And they're cheating the people.
Look at the public which is ruined by electing such people.
Look at their feelings.
Only these people give power to politicians send them to parliament.
All the laws were formulated for these people only.
The only place which can give orders to the government in our supreme court.
You yourself had enquired about many unlawful things in this country.
Human rights were violated at Ervadi,
And mentally retarded people were facing, many problems.
When you came to know about it you intervened,
And it was the supreme court which rehabilitated them.
All the states took census of people living below poverty line.
It was the supreme court which gave this order.
When the supreme court is able to question these things.
Why are you not questioning the corrupt?
Let your death sentence to them, be the new beginning.
Let your judgement be an example.
Give your judgement...
How can we give the judgement without seeing them alive?
Over there.
We'll surrender them to you without even a scratch on them.
Look for yourself.
If we had wished we could've punished them, but we didn't.
Because we still believe the law department.
We've surrendered them to you without a scratch.
Now, give your judgement.
All interrogated will be done according to law.
The law won't abide for your demands.
Cases against them will have the lawful waivers.
We're not ready to abide by your arguments.
Move away.
If supreme court doesn't punish these corrupt unlawful politicians,
We must only punish them.
They're punishing the people who ask for justice,
And leaving the people who've committed injustice.
Kill them.
Smash those who've committed mistakes.
We order police to save the kidnapped arrest the kidnappers.
He has done all these things risking his life.
What kind of a judgement are you giving?
They have deceived us.
After all this, if we keep quiet we aren't humans.
Chop them.
Don't be in a hurry
-Give me the gun.Leave me.
Some one has shot him they've killed justice.
We shouldn't spare him.
I feel delicate to arrest you.
You've struggled for people risked your life.
I feel your speech struggle were right.
You were carrying the duty assigned to us.
The law which you were asking, must come to practise.
It is everyone's desire.
I'm not coming as Deiva, but as Kavitha
That is snow
Ultraman Cosmos
You can become strong, it's all right.
What is love?
What is justice?
To win with only strength,
There is something lacking.
At times a fist, at times a flower, but fights take place in our hearts!
You can become strong it's all right.
Power that begins from gentleness,
That is a hero.
At any time, wanna be right.
Only to yourself must you never lose.
The vow of Ultra...
The Door of Snow
Gruanfan comes up
Across from this door there lives Gruanfan
Mr. Tomano told me about it
I met him in the early summer
A slight force suddenly pushed my back
That slight force
Cram school?
We are in 3rd grade.
There is a big exam next year
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
I'm jogging
Why?
In the last district contest
Come on...
You don't look good
This is just one of my habits This is how I pluck up my courage
You'll say "be fast" in the test... won't you?
Sure
Sure
The time has come?
It's really troublesome
What are you doing?
I'm asking Gruanfan to hear my tunes of memories
The air is refreshing here You can hear beautiful tunes
Gruanfan
Right...
Gruanfan lives right across this door
Damn...
What did you say?
Nothing... please take it easy
Right...
It will be fixed for the time being
Thank you
Let me do it
But... you should practice more
I don't need any practice
The community contest was closed last month
I had a good performance in the contest
I made my best record in the preliminary
Ready...
When I stand upon the line
The lines on the runway seem to be sparkling
I think I will win and get into the national
How?
Who will win?
At the very moment I only care about who will win
I just fell a little behind
Thus... my summer ended by only 2/100 secs
What a pity
It's a pity
Let's not talk about this now sir
You have to let Gruanfan over there listen to your music
Right... right
My name is Tomano
I am Akira
Tomano, stand over there Let me do it
Gruanfan likes listening to music
Right... if Gruanfan likes this
It should appear by the door
Really?
Can I see it.
if it comes?
It comes from a cold place
So if Gruanfan gets close the weather will be cold
What kind of animal is it?
It's an ancient creature that goes into our heart
And the ancient memory revives it in front of us
And then, once we go into the scenes of the memory
We can go with Gruanfan
Together?
Where?
The other side of the door
It leads to the "World of Memory"
I thought it's just a fairy tale
But... 3 days later
There is snowing in the summer
Right... it snowed suddenly
I'm so jealous
The EYES
Don't worry...
I'm sorry Don't be afraid
Are you here to look into this city?
You know what has happened?
I don't know too much
You seem to...
No... nothing at all Goodbye
Mr. Tomano
You...
Akira
Look at this
Gruanfan will be here soon
Gruanfan will take me to the world across from the door
Once it goes back
Everything will be restored
Only in his short presence in this world
The time in this world will be paused
Time will be paused?
Right
Because time of the real world and of the memory can't coexist
So when no one knows that time is paused
You will go with it?
Don't worry
You can see Gruanfan
If you see the sparkle of snow in the beginning
Close your eyes then
Why do you want to go to the world of memory
I found you
I've been looking for you
Nothing has happened to you
Nothing...
Not at all
You'd better not stay here tonight
It's getting cold and you might catch a cold
The EYES uniform resists heat and coldness
It's warm in winter and very flexible
Let me ask you...
what is the light of snow?
The light of snow?
Forget it
Anyway... don't stay in the city
Wait
What the hell
Ayano, what has happened?
Nothing at all
Let's go
Eh?
40 years ago...
my young wife and I... and my son
My wife passed away 5 years ago
Everything was just like yesterday
Mr. Tomano played the violin before
I used to be a violinist
So the song Gruanfan listens to
Yes...
I played it
That's awesome
No... there's only one song recorded
I can't be a famous violinist
But...
I've always wanted to be a violinist
Although I can't play the violin as I used to
But at this age...
it's reasonable
Afterward Mr. Tomano remains silent
I don't know Mr. Tomano on the picture
But I think Mr Tomano his the feeling of hollowness that no one can help with
How can you collect so many books?
There's something about abnormal weather conditions
It's okay if you wanna open it but you have to clean it up
I see
Mr. Musashi
Have you ever heard the light of snow?
The light of snow?
I just...
Got it
Where?
Look
Come on
It shows up
Coming
Gruanfan
Mr. Tomano...
you wanna go with memory?
No way
Why?
Isn't that the time of the picture?
All that Mr. Tomano has are over there
Why don't you go?
Suddenly I realize
Those used to belong to me
I can't let the time be restored
Mr. Tomano
Only once
Right
No matter what it is...
it's only a short moment
Because only once...
you can't forget it
You won
I won
You won
Because it comes just once your brain is preoccupied with something
Mr. Tomano Send Gruanfan back
Why...
Why do you look down on EYES We are really troubled
By the way...
You are here to help me
Eh?
Don't care about it...
Follow me now
Eh?
Here...
Gruanfan come here
Yours
Please accept this card
I should say goodbye to you
You wanna say goodbye to me?
The one who opens the door has to disappear from this world
Please remember...
I live a happy life
Although no one knows and it might be a normal life
But I've made it
I've gained something important about loneliness
I won't forget
Thank you
I don't live to create memories
But..
Someday, when I leave this world
I've done my best
I'm count all the same days
You have reached me that I'm alive
Someday, I'll grasp the dream and I'll travel
Open the doors of heart and I will see a new you
The light of love will be there when you want it
The friendship of heart that joined us
Now we must...
I wanna run
Even if can see ahead Even if I am not the first one
I will grow up

Musashi
Musashi
Answer me...
Musashi
Where are they?
I don't know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
...This is not a dr...
...Dad!
Hey...
Honey...
Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
Alright, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an arse-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favour.
Alright, listen...
we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
Alright, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three 1...
...Alright.
2... 3! Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your arse, bitch!
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
It's time for an arse-whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
CAROLINE:
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
...You can?
...Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop!
It's hideous!
Get it off!
I-I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da!
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amoebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but I-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
I-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favourite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
GRAHAM:
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm...
I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and...
and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something... what I said in there, it still goes.
Your... your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
CARL:
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far... 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
MAN ON RADIO:
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favour, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey...
I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world...
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows... covertlike.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing."
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group... very small...
to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall...
set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
[Pounds table] CARL: 13!
¶ Don't give me that so-so-soda ¶
¶ That same old cola ¶
¶ I wanna pop ¶ ...¶ Pop, pop I wanna...
Shasta ¶ ...I'll take it.
TRACE Y:
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly..."shits"
and..."bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he?
MERRILL:
What is it?
GRAHAM:
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyse Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, alright.
Turn it up.
See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
[Static, droning continue]
It's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
BO:
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous!
Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U.S. officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
MAN ON TV:
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
[Exhales sharply] Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way... is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
[Exhales sharply] She was just sitting there
looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her and I realise I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident... drunk driving, they weren't sure...
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
...Is he okay?
...Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5.00 a.m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11.00 a.m.
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His...
his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, I-like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now... all over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c... the crop circles.
They could be some kind of... some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate... makes sense.
MORGAN:
Want to hear a story?
BO:
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realised the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book Bimbu?
...Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason...
they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
MAN:
Father?
Hello?
I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house...
no one.
Where you going?
...Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
[Door opens, slams]
BO:
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment... that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh...
Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such... none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.
Alright.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
WOMAN ON TV:
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7 th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Oh!
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy waggon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
Their skin changes colours.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics...
hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle 'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?
Is this really happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favour of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favour of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favour of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
MAN ON TV:
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be 400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack manoeuvre.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like "War of the Worlds."
MAN ON TV:
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone?
Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
...Stop crying!
...Graham...
...Don't yell at her! Alright, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
[Chuckles] Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she's like an angel."
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad...
Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamt about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamt."
MERRILL:
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
...[Light bulb shatters] ...Dad!
Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
What's happening out there?
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
[Wind whistling]
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamt this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We're the same.
We're the same.
[Exhales deeply]
We should save the flashlights.
CAROLINE:
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean...
pinned?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's... she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out 'cause we... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
MAN ON RADIO:
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
...I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I'm serious.
Okay.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now...
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
MAN ON TV:
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
...They're doing this on TV.
...People are celebrating.
There's a great sense of relief.
...They're dancing.
...Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life, ...Do you want to see it?
...we will be left with a lot of questions.
...I'll bring the TV in here.
...I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
[Voice breaking] Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
[Voice breaking] I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham...
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
GRAHAM:
That's why he had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D-Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't... don't.
MORGAN:
Dad?
What happened?
Did someone save me?
Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
- This is not a dr...
- Dad!
Hey...
Honey...
Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an ass-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favor.
All right, listen...
we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three...
- 1...
- All right.
2... 3!
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your ass, bitch!
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
It's time for an ass-whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop!
It's hideous!
Get it off!
I-I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da!
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but I-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
I-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm...
I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and...
and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something... what I said in there, it still goes.
Your... your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far... 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey...
I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world...
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows... covert like.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing."
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group... very small...
to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall...
set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
13!
## Don't give me that so-so-soda ##
## That same old cola ##
## I wanna pop ##
- ## Pop, pop I wanna...
Shasta ##
- I'll take it.
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly..."shits"
and..."bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he?
What is it?
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, all right.
Turn it up.
See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
It's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous!
Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. Officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way... is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
She was just sitting there looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realize I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident... drunk driving, they weren't sure...
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5:00 a.m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11:00 a.m.
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His...
his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, l-like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now...
All over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c... the crop circles.
They could be some kind of... some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate... makes sense.
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book...
- Bimbu?
- Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason...
they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
Father?
Hello?
I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house...
no one.
Where you going?
Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment... that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh...
Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such... none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.
All right.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Move, children!
Vámanos!
Oh!
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
Their skin changes colors.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics...
hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle 'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?
Is this really happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be 400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like "War of the Worlds."
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone?
Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
Stop crying!
- Graham...
- Don't yell at her!
All right, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she's like an angel."
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad...
Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamed."
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
Dad!
Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
What's happening out there?
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamed this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We're the same.
We're the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean...
pinned?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's... she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out 'cause we... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I'm serious.
Okay.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now...
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
- People are celebrating.
- They're doing this on TV.
There's a great sense of relief.
- They're dancing.
- Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life,
- Do you want to see it?
- We will be left with a lot of questions.
- I'll bring the TV in here.
- I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham...
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Ahhhh!
That's why he had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D-Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't... don't.
Dad?
What happened?
Did someone save me?
Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
[Suspenseful instrumental music plays]
[Music intensifies]
[Silence]
[Gasps]
[Door hinges creak]
[Bo screams]
[Bo screams]
[Insects chirping]
[Door hinges creak, door slams]
Where are they?
I don't know.
MORGAN:
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
[Birds cawing]
[Rapid footsteps]
Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
- This is not a dr...
- MORGAN:
Dad!
Hey...
Honey...
[Panting]
Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.
[Dogs barking in distance]
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
[Barking continues, birds cawing]
[Barking]
Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
[Sighing] Alright, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
[Telephone beeps]
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
[Chain rattles]
[Door hinges creak;
door opens, slams]
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
[Sighs deeply]
So, what happened to your crops?
[Sizzling]
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
[Barks]
[Growling]
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
[Growling continues]
Stop it, Houdini.
[Barks]
[Gasps]
[Snarling]
CAROLINE:
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
GRAHAM:
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
[Birds cawing]
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
[Sniffles]
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
[Sniffling and wheezing]
- [Air hisses] - [Inhales deeply]
[Exhales deeply]
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
[Insects chirping]
[Gasps] What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
[Breathes deeply]
[Sighs softly]
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
[Sighs deeply]
[Inhales sharply]
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an arse-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favour.
Alright, listen...
we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Ust make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
Alright, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three...
- 1...
- Alright.
2... 3!
[Door hinges creak]
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your arse, bitch!
[Clattering]
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
[Rapid footsteps]
It's time for an arse-whupping!
[Rapid footsteps]
[Both panting]
I cursed.
I heard.
[Rustling]
How did he get...
[Rustling continues]
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
[Clattering]
[Squeaking]
[Birds chirping]
CAROLINE:
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
[Machinery whirring on television]
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
MAN:
Stop!
It's hideous!
WOMAN:
Get it off!
L-I know what to do.
[Woman shuddering]
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da!
[Laser gun fires]
[Volume decreases]
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amoebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
[Chuckles]
I never got a chance to tell you, but l-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
L-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favourite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
[Footsteps approach]
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
GRAHAM:
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
[Indistinct conversations]
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
- [Air hisses] - [Inhales deeply]
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm...
I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and...
and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something... what I said in there, it still goes.
Your... your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
[Engine turns over]
MAN ON TV:
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
WOMAN ON RADIO:
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
[Radio turns off]
No radio either.
Ust for a while.
[Sighs]
[Brakes squeak]
Book money?
Sure.
Ust one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
CARL:
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far... 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
MAN ON RADIO:
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
WOMAN:
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favour, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey...
I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
[Voice breaking] All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world...
I'm just a little scared.
[Sniffles]
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows... covertlike.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing."
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group... very small...
to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall...
set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
[Pounds table] CARL: 13!
!
Don't give me that so-so-soda!
!
That same old cola!
!
I wanna pop!
- !
Pop, pop I wanna...
Shasta!
- I'll take it.
TRACE Y:
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly..."shits"
and..."bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "ohn, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
[Breathes deeply]
Is that him?
Yeah.
[Car door closes, engine turns over]
Who is he?
[Tyres squeal]
[Insects chirping]
[Car approaches]
[Brakes squeak]
[Static]
MERRILL:
What is it?
GRAHAM:
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
[Droning]
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyse Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, alright.
Turn it up.
See.
[Volume increases]
[Droning continues]
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
[Static, droning continue]
It's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
[Droning continues, volume increases]
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
[Droning]
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
[Pitch fluctuates]
Let me see it.
[High-pitched droning]
Stop!
[Warbling]
[Volume decreases]
See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
BO:
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
MERRILL:
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
[Volume increases]
[Panting]
[Droning, trilling]
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
[Droning, trilling]
[Static]
[Sighs]
[Bell clanging]
[Isabel barks, whines]
[Barking continues]
[Barking]
- [Snarls] - [Gasps]
[Barking continues]
[Chain rattling]
[Whining]
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
[Whining continues]
[Creaks]
[Barking continues]
- [Trilling] - [Gasps]
[Breathing heavily]
[Echoing] You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous!
[Trilling]
[Gasps]
[Breathing heavily]
[Corn stalks rustling]
[Trills]
[Gasps]
[Panting]
[Dishes clanking, water splashing]
[Giggling]
[Sighs deeply]
Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
[Clicks, television humming]
MAN ON TV:
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U.S. Officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
- [Siren walls on TV]
- The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
[Videotape clattering]
[Siren continues]
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
MAN ON TV:
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
- [Wheezing]
- Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
- [Air hisses] - [Inhales deeply]
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
[Exhales sharply] Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way... is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
[Clicks tongue]
[Exhales sharply] She was just sitting there looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her...
[Laughing] and I realise I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
[Chuckles softly]
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
[Laughs]
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
[Siren walls]
[Keys jingle, engine turns off]
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident... drunk driving, they weren't sure...
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance, Father.
[Floorboards squeak]
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5.00 a.m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11.00 a.m.
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His...
his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, l-like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now... all over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c... the crop circles.
They could be some kind of... some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate... makes sense.
[Wind chimes tinkling]
MORGAN:
Want to hear a story?
BO:
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realised the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book...
- Bimbu?
- Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason...
they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
[Telephone rings]
- [Gasps] - [Gasps]
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
[Ringing continues]
Hello?
MAN:
Father?
Hello?
[Pulsating tone]
[Footsteps approach]
[Door hinges creak]
I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house...
no one.
MERRILL:
Where you going?
- [Keys jingle]
- Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
[Door opens, slams]
BO:
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
[Knock on door]
[Insects chirping]
[Insects chirping, door hinges creak]
[Creaking]
[Pulsating tone]
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment... that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
[Keys jingle]
[Engine turns over]
Wh...
Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such... none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.
[Sighs deeply]
Alright.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
[Tyres spin]
WOMAN ON TV:
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7 th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
[Children shouting indistinctly in Portuguese]
[Dog barking]
Move, children!
Vamanos!
[Shouting continues]
[Shouting intensifies]
Oh!
[Shouting continues]
[Tape rewinds]
[Shouts in Portuguese]
[Rustling, wind whistling]
[Rustling stops]
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy waggon.
Ust tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
[Sighs]
[Knife scrapes]
[Grunts]
[Scrapes]
Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
[Both scream]
[Birds chirping]
[Dead bolt clicks]
Their skin changes colours.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics...
hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle 'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?
Is this really happening?
[Sighs]
I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favour of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favour of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favour of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
[Sighs deeply]
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
[Sighs deeply]
[Wind chimes tinkling]
[Wind chimes tinkling]
[Door hinges creak]
[Corn stalks rustling]
[Tinkling, rustling continue]
[Soft thud]
[Tinkling, rustling intensify]
MAN ON TV:
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
- [Siren walls on TV, pounding]
- MORGAN:
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and erusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be 400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack manoeuvre.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
[Horns honk on TV]
It's like "War of the Worlds."
MAN ON TV:
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
[Clears throat]
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
[Indistinct conversations, bell tolls]
God be with us all.
[Machinery clanking, helicopters whirring on TV]
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
[Tinkling]
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
[Chuckles]
What's the matter with everyone?
Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
MERRILL:
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
[Bo cries]
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
- [Crying continues]
- Stop crying!
- Graham...
- Don't yell at her!
[Crying continues]
Alright, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
[Silverware bangs]
[Sniffles]
[Crying]
[Static]
[Droning, trilling]
["Off air" signal blaring]
It's happening.
[Insects chirping]
[Silence]
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
[Chuckles] Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she's like an angel."
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
[Isabel barking in distance]
We forgot Isabel.
[Barking continues]
[Growling]
[Whimpering]
[Silence]
[Wind chimes tinkling]
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
[Footsteps]
[Wind chimes tinkling]
[Sighs]
[Footsteps continue]
[Loud thud]
[Thud]
[Clattering]
Dad...
[Rapid footsteps]
Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
[Footsteps continue]
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
[Crash]
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamt about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamt."
[Breathes deeply]
[Chuckles]
[Clattering]
[Rapid footsteps]
MERRILL:
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
[Trilling]
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
- [Light bulb shatters]
- Dad!
[Thumping, clattering]
[Coughs]
Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
[Footsteps, clattering]
[Clicks, tuning, static]
What's happening out there?
GRAHAM:
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
[Pounding on door]
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
[Pounding continues]
They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
[Pounding continues]
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
[Pounding continues]
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
[Wind whistling]
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
[Rustling, clattering]
[Panting]
[Wheezing]
We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamt this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
It'll pass.
[Wheezing continues]
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
[Panting]
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Ust wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
[Inhales deeply]
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
[Exhales deeply] Together.
[Exhales deeply] We're the same.
[Voice breaking] We're the same.
[Exhales deeply]
We should save the flashlights.
[Clicks]
[Clicks]
[Clicks]
[Sirens wailing]
CAROLINE:
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean...
pinned?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's... she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out 'cause we... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
[Indistinct radio conversation]
MAN ON RADIO:
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
- [Static]
- I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
[Static]
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
[Static]
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
[Static]
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
[Radio turns off]
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I'm serious.
Okay.
[Wheezes]
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now...
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
[Clicks]
[Static]
[Sighs]
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
[Clanging]
[Hinges creak]
[Indistinct television conversation]
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
MAN ON TV:
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
- They're doing this on TV.
- People are celebrating.
There's a great sense of relief.
- They're dancing.
- Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life,
- Do you want to see it?
- We will be left with a lot of questions.
- I'll bring the TV in here.
- I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
[TV turns off]
[Trilling]
Merrill, wait.
[Growls, trills]
[Wheezing]
[Growling]
[Trilling]
[Weakly] Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
[Voice breaking] Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
[Voice breaking] I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham...
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?
[Hisses]
[Trilling]
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
[Groans]
[Growls]
[Grunts]
[Alien growls]
[Trills]
[Sizzling]
[Growls]
[Trilling]
[Growls]
[Hisses]
Ahhhh!

[Wheezing]
[Silence]
GRAHAM:
That's why he had asthma.
[Breathing heavily]
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D-Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't... don't.
MORGAN:
Dad?
What happened?
[Gasps]
Did someone save me?
[Sobs]
Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
[Giggling, indistinct conversation]
[Instrumental music playing]
[Music ends] Subtitles :
Filou ;-)
Where are they?
I don't know.
Morgan:
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan! Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
-
- This is not a dr-- Dad!
Hey...
Honey... Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking -- woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan? Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops? Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy? Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny -- and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around -- peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father".
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an ass-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favor.
All right, listen -- we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger -- make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy".
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises".
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three 1...
-
- All right.
2...3! Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your ass, bitch! We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind! It's time for an ass-whupping! I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get... Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard? You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
-
- You can?
-
- Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop!
It's hideous!
Get it off!
I-I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da! You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but I-I thought your moving in here with your brother after -- it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark".
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
I-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know -- I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you -- maybe a-a church member who -- who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was -- he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
Graham:
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm -
- I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and -- and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something -- what I said in there, it still goes.
Your -- your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
Woman on radio:
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky -- No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far -- 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment -- decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey...
I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV -- two girls came in here talking about the end of the world --
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows -- covertlike.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing".
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group -- very small -- to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation -- evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall -- set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
13!
## Don't give me that so-so-soda ##
## That same old cola ##
## I wanna pop ##
-- ## Pop, pop I wanna...
Shasta ## -
- I'll take it.
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly..."shits"
and..."bastards".
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood? Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he? What is it?
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, all right.
Turn it up.
See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please? lt's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop! See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous! Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U.S. officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign -- evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way -- is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
She was just sitting there looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realize I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See".
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away".
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident -- drunk driving, they weren't sure --
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
-
- Is he okay?
-
- Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5:00 a.m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11:00 a.m.
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His -- his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, I-like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now...
All over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c-- the crop circles.
They could be some kind of -- some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate -- makes sense.
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book -- -
- Bimbu?
-
- Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us -- to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason -- they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
Father?
Hello? I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house -- no one.
Where you going?
Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die? Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment -- that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh-
- Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such -- none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.
All right.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Move, children!
Vámanos! Oh! Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Oh!
Ah!
Oh! Their skin changes colors.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh...in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics -- hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle 'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what -- what book is this?
Is this really happening? I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be 400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like "War of the Worlds".
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone?
Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood? Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
Stop crying!
-
- Graham...
-
- Don't yell at her! All right, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she's like an angel".
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful".
And then...you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad... Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamed".
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
Dad! Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
What's happening out there?
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door? They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him! We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamed this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We're the same.
We're the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean -- pinned?
The truck -- the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's -- she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out 'cause we -- we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I'm serious.
Okay.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now --
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
-
- People are celebrating.
-
- They're doing this on TV.
There's a great sense of relief.
-
- They're dancing.
-
- Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life,
-
- Do you want to see it?
-
- We will be left with a lot of questions.
-
- I'll bring the TV in here.
-
- I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was...just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham --
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences? Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
Ahhhhhhhhh! Ahhhh! That's why he had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D-Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't...don't.
Dad?
What happened? Did someone save me? Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
Ripped by muy_tAte from Signs.DVDRip.XViD-ViTE (Removed Hearing Impaired Stuff) Where are they?
I don't know.
Morgan:
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan! Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
-
- This is not a dr-- Dad!
Hey...
Honey... Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking -- woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan? Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops? Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy? Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny -- and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around -- peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father".
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an ass-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favor.
All right, listen -- we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger -- make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy".
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises".
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three 1...
-
- All right.
2...3! Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your ass, bitch! We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind! It's time for an ass-whupping! I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get... Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard? You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
-
- You can?
-
- Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop!
It's hideous!
Get it off!
I-I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da! You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but I-I thought your moving in here with your brother after -- it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark".
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
I-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know -- I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you -- maybe a-a church member who -- who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was -- he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
Graham:
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm -
- I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and -- and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something -- what I said in there, it still goes.
Your -- your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
Woman on radio:
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky -- No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far -- 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment -- decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey...
I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV -- two girls came in here talking about the end of the world --
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows -- covertlike.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing".
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group -- very small -- to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation -- evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall -- set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
13!
## Don't give me that so-so-soda ##
## That same old cola ##
## I wanna pop ##
-- ## Pop, pop I wanna...
Shasta ## -
- I'll take it.
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly..."shits"
and..."bastards".
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood? Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he? What is it?
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, all right.
Turn it up.
See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please? lt's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop! See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous! Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U.S. officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign -- evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way -- is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
She was just sitting there looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realize I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See".
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away".
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident -- drunk driving, they weren't sure --
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
-
- Is he okay?
-
- Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5:00 a.m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11:00 a.m.
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His -- his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, I-like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now...
All over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c-- the crop circles.
They could be some kind of -- some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate -- makes sense.
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book -- -
- Bimbu?
-
- Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us -- to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason -- they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
Father?
Hello? I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house -- no one.
Where you going?
Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die? Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment -- that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh-
- Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such -- none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.
All right.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Move, children!
Vámanos! Oh! Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Oh!
Ah!
Oh! Their skin changes colors.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh...in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics -- hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle 'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what -- what book is this?
Is this really happening? I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be 400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like "War of the Worlds".
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone?
Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood? Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
Stop crying!
-
- Graham...
-
- Don't yell at her! All right, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she's like an angel".
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful".
And then...you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad... Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamed".
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
Dad! Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
What's happening out there?
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door? They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him! We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamed this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We're the same.
We're the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean -- pinned?
The truck -- the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's -- she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out 'cause we -- we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I'm serious.
Okay.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now --
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
-
- People are celebrating.
-
- They're doing this on TV.
There's a great sense of relief.
-
- They're dancing.
-
- Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life,
-
- Do you want to see it?
-
- We will be left with a lot of questions.
-
- I'll bring the TV in here.
-
- I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was...just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham --
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences? Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
Ahhhhhhhhh! Ahhhh! That's why he had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D-Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't...don't.
Dad?
What happened? Did someone save me? Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
Ripped by muy_tAte from Signs.DVDRip.XViD-ViTE (Removed Hearing Impaired Stuff)
Where are they?
I don't know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
...This is not a dr...
Dad!
Hey...
Honey...
Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an ass-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favor.
All right, listen...
we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three 1...
...All right.
2... 3!
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your ass, bitch!
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
It's time for an ass-whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
...You can?
...Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop!
It's hideous!
Get it off!
l-I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da!
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but l-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
l-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm...
I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and...
and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something... what I said in there, it still goes.
Your... your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far... 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey...
I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world...
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows... covertlike.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing. "
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group... very small...
to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 50 7-footer over the left-field wall...
set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
Carl: 13!
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly..."shits"
and..."bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he?
What is it?
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, all right.
Turn it up.
See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
It's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous!
Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. Officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
...The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
...Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way... is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
She was just sitting there
looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realize I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away. "
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident... drunk driving, they weren't sure...
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
...Is he okay?
...Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5:00 a.m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11:00 a.m.
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His...
his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, l-like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now...
All over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c... the crop circles.
They could be some kind of... some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate... makes sense.
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book Bimbu?
...Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason...
they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
Man:
Father?
Hello?
I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house...
no one.
Where you going?
...Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment... that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh...
Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such... none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.
All right.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7 th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Move, children!
Vamanos!
Oh!
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
Their skin changes colors.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics...
hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle 'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?
Is this really happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 2 74 cities.
They think it'll be 400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like "War of the Worlds."
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone?
Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
...Stop crying!
...Graham...
...Don't yell at her! All right, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she's like an angel."
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad...
Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamed."
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
...Dad!
Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
What's happening out there?
Graham:
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamed this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We're the same.
We're the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean...
pinned?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's... she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out 'cause we... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
...I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I'm serious.
Okay.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now...
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
...People are celebrating.
...They're doing this on TV.
There's a great sense of relief.
...They're dancing.
...Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life, ...Do you want to see it?
...We will be left with a lot of questions.
...I'll bring the TV in here.
...I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham...
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
That's why he had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D-Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't... don't.
Dad?
What happened?
Did someone save me?
Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
Signs (2002) 25 fps
Where are they?
I don't know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
- This is not a dr...
- Dad!
Hey...
Honey...
Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
Alright, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an arse-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favour.
Alright, listen...
we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
Alright, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three...
- 1...
- Alright.
2...3!
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your arse, bitch!
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
It's time for an arse-whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop!
It's hideous!
Get it off!
L-I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da!
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amoebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but l-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
L-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favourite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm...
I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and...
and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something... what I said in there, it still goes.
Your... your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far... 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favour, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey...
I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world...
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows... covertlike.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing."
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group... very small...
to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall...
set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
13!
Don't give me that so-so-soda
That same old cola
I wanna pop
- Pop, pop I wanna...
Shasta
- I'll take it.
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly..."shits"
and..."bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he?
What is it?
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyse Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, alright.
Turn it up.
See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
It's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous!
Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U.S. Officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way... is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
She was just sitting there looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realise I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident... drunk driving, they weren't sure...
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5.00 a.m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11.00 a.m.
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His...
his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, l-like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now... all over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c... the crop circles.
They could be some kind of... some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate... makes sense.
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realised the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book...
- Bimbu?
- Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason...
they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
Father?
Hello?
I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house...
no one.
Where you going?
Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment... that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh...
Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such... none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.
Alright.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7 th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Move, children!
Vámanos!
Oh!
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy waggon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
Their skin changes colours.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics...
hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle 'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?
Is this really happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favour of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favour of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favour of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be 400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack manoeuvre.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like "War of the Worlds."
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone?
Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
Stop crying!
- Graham...
- Don't yell at her!
Alright, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she's like an angel."
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad...
Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamt about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamt."
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
Dad!
Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
What's happening out there?
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamt this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We're the same.
We're the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean...
pinned?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's... she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out 'cause we... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I'm serious.
Okay.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now...
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
- They're doing this on TV.
- People are celebrating.
There's a great sense of relief.
- They're dancing.
- Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life,
- Do you want to see it?
- We will be left with a lot of questions.
- I'll bring the TV in here.
- I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham...
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Ahhhh!
That's why he had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D-Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't... don't.
Dad?
What happened?
Did someone save me?
Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
Where are they?
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Morgan!
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Are you in my dream, too?
- This is not a dr...
- Dad!
Morgan, what's happening?
The dogs are barking.
Woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
Just have a word with him.
That'd be enough for me.
It was strange, finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it.
It'd take the strangeness away if I knew it was Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Thanks for your patience.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
- He doesn't treat animals.
- He'll know what to do.
That was quick, Caroline.
I called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when some kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thorton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spittin'!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place.
She must've had a cold.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
- It tastes funny.
- It does not.
Besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
Stop it.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
What machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
Doesn't sound like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon.
- He would've mentioned something.
- Why were you at Theo's?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny.
Some of them violent.
- Is it a virus?
- I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy.
On alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator, peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline?
Please stop calling me "Father".
- What's wrong?
- I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
- Did he hurt you?
- No.
I'm so sorry.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabelle up to the back of the shed, please.
Make sure the knot's tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me, either.
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an ass-whoopin'.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend.
- This is his son.
- We'll be doing Lee a favor.
We go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act insane with anger, make them crap in their pants.
Force them around till we meet up on the other side.
- Explain "act crazy".
- Curse and stuff.
- Want me to curse?
- You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
It won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
- Just make noises, then.
- Explain "noises".
- Are you gonna do this or what?
- No, I'm not.
You want them stealing from the house next time?
On the count of three.
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your ass, bitch!
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
It's time for an ass-whoopin'!
- I cursed.
- I heard.
How did he get up...?
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's monitor as a walkie-talkie.
You can?
It only works one way, but it'll do fine.
Until someone gets you a new walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water and you finish it.
What's wrong with this?
- It has dust in it.
- This one?
A hair.
Morgan took a sip and it has his amoebas in it.
How are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How's work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but I thought you moving in here with your brother after...
That was a nice thing to do.
I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
OK, so far I have: "It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
So he was tall?
- I would say so.
- Probably.
Over six feet?
- It was very dark.
- Yes.
How certain are you that this was a male?
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know.
I have seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in a second.
Our roof is ten feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point, but what is it?
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon, and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No-one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw.
We should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Check in the sofa cushions.
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions.
And I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge against you?
Maybe a church member?
Who might not have liked the fact you left the church?
I don't think so.
I was out of line with the female Scandinavian Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, just change the channel on the television?
- I did.
- And?
Same show is on every station.
Every station.
Turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s.
Dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals, over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or, basically it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of yours overnight,
- using just boards and ropes.
- Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there's so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm going back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee.
Try to think clear.
After that, I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you, what I said in there, it still goes.
Your family has been through a lot.
The last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things.
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself.
Graham.
The footage was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
No radio, either.
Just for a while.
- Book money?
- Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas, it's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen twelve soda commercials so far.
Twelve!
Do you have any books on extraterrestrials?
You don't believe this horse manure?
I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment.
Decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no-one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone, somewhere, does the first one.
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" any more.
...a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey, I am not a Reverend any more.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV, Joe Gills came in talking about the end of the world,
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
- You do?
- I've had two separate folks tell me there've been strangers around here last couple of nights.
Can't tell what they look like, 'cause they're staying in the shadows, covert-like.
Nobody's been hurt.
And that's the give-away.
- I see.
- It's called "probing".
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group, very small.
Check things out.
Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation.
Evaluate the level of danger.
Make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah.
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
You didn't use to play baseball, did you?
Shit, I know you, you're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the wall.
Set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home.
On the wall.
You've got two minor-league home run records?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros, making stacks of cash, and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a Class-A screw-up.
He'd just swing that bat as hard as he could.
Didn't matter what the coaches said or who was on base.
He'd whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
Thirteen!
I'll take it.
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "f" word a couple times, but mostly... "shits"
and... "bastards".
Is "douchebag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douchebag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37, it's 71 .
Pharmacy crowded?
None of you are to spend time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Understood?
Is that him?
Who is he?
- What is it?
- It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
- It's not.
- But it wasn't working.
This crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend.
They're 30, they work up codes together, they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies, where other guys who never had girlfriends can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static.
Turn it up and see.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
It's noise.
It's broken.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
- Maybe some new batteries.
- We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move!
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
This is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
- I'm letting go now.
- No, Dad!
- Don't do it!
- You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabelle, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops, to the news or TV or anybody.
You're not going to get famous.
Let's turn on the TV.
...first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as US officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York, as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City airspace.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
- The nerds were right.
- We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything written in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children and say you were there.
For your children.
- My ballet recital.
- Dad?
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups.
When they experience something lucky, group number one sees it as more than luck.
More than coincidence.
They see it as a sign.
Evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck.
A happy turn of chance.
I'm sure people in group two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, this situation is a 50/50.
Could be bad.
Could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
So you have to ask yourself, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles, or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or, look at the question this way.
Is is possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
She's just sitting there, looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her, and I realize I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened, it was a miracle.
I could've been kissing her when she threw up.
That would've scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words Colleen said before they let her die.
She said "See".
And her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said "Swing away".
You know why she said that?
'Cause the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died.
Some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head.
There is no-one watching out for us.
We are all on our own.
- What do you know?
- There was an accident, drunk driving.
Not drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
- Is he OK?
- Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She's talking?
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
They were watching TV from 5:00 a.m.
They were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing "furry, furry rabbit".
- What's "furry, furry rabbit"?
- It's a game.
They closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
- What time is it?
- 11:00 a.m.
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew where the lights were last night.
It stopped in the air and fell straight down.
They been playing the tape all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
The bird's head was crushed in.
They think there's some invisible shield.
Like an optical illusion.
They're still there.
Hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now.
All over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the crop circles.
They think they'd be some kind of...
Some kind of landmark, visual mapping systems, so they could navigate.
Coordinate.
Makes sense.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development.
They're probably vegetarians, they realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
- That means they're unemployed.
- If you're gonna make fun, forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book...
- Bimboo?
- Dad.
- I just asked his name.
- You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us.
To make contact to further their knowledge of the universe, or the other reason.
They're hostile.
They've used up their resources, and now they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
- Same windows.
- That's weird.
That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for now.
Everybody needs to calm down.
Eat some fruit or something.
- Hello?
- Father?
I'm going out for a few minutes.
No-one leaves this house, no-one.
Where are you going?
Ray Reddy's house.
- Why?
- I think he just called here.
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for six months.
When I knew it was inside the house,
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before.
- Never since.
- Don't...
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would've ended up in a ditch with a headache.
It had to be at that right moment.
That ten, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world, I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't ushered into heaven.
Where are you going?
To the lake.
Way I see it, this place is marked in crops and such.
None of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.
Don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The footage we're about to show was photographed by 42-year-old Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday at his son's seventh birthday in Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the news bureau there and sent via satellite a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Move, children!
¡Vamonos!
Hello.
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Their skin changes colors.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
In this book of yours, did they detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
Said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics.
Hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use technology or fight an airborne battle, 'cause they know eventually we'd use nuclear weapons, and the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they are defeated and have to return again with full forces, hundreds, maybe even thousands of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Is this really happening?
I heard a theory that they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling it wanted to harm me.
So, we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
- OK, my vote counts as two.
- That's bullshit, you're cheating!
Calm down.
I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here, anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
- I change my vote.
- You can't change your vote.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose.
Three to two.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
This information comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill.
...Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be 400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
They think these are stages preceding an attack maneuver.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like War of the Worlds.
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
You guys OK?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
- I wish you were my dad.
- What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
- We don't have enough boards.
- We'll board up the doors.
- Where are we gonna sleep?
- In the family room.
What about Isabelle?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
- I want spaghetti.
- We'll just eat fast.
Spaghetti sounds great.
- What do you want, Morgan?
- Anything?
French toast.
And mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
- Chicken teriyaki.
- Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone?
Eat.
- Maybe we should say a prayer?
- No.
- Why not?
- We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
- I had a dream.
- We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat.
I hate you.
- That's fine.
- You let Mom die.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
Now, we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
Stop crying!
Don't yell at her!
All right, since you're not gonna eat, I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry!
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came outta your momma, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes and looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous, all the ladies in the room just gasped.
They literally gasped.
They go, "Oh, she's like an angel."
They said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then, you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabelle.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad?
Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your momma kept bleeding.
The doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your momma to see you first, because she had dreamed about you her whole life.
And she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms.
She looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said, real soft,
"Hello, Morgan, I'm your momma."
"You looked just how I dreamed."
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
I forgot our foil helmets.
Is there anything to wedge against the door?
They'll read our minds.
- You're scaring your sister.
- I'm already scared.
- I'm looking!
- They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Got it!
Where's Bo?
I'm OK.
What's happening out there?
I can't even imagine.
Hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
- They're distracting us.
- From what?
The book says they're good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
- I can feel air.
- Me, too!
- It's getting stronger.
- We're close.
What?
Pull him.
You got him?
- Pull him!
- I got him.
We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
I dreamed this.
Stay with me.
I know, it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate You.
The fear is feeding it.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
Together, we're the same.
We're the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray's truck swerved off the road, and he hit Colleen, and then a tree.
She was pinned between the two.
What does that mean, "pinned"?
The truck, the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive.
And the truck is holding her together.
She doesn't feel much, and she's talking almost like normal.
We didn't pull the truck out, 'cause we want you to come and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family, they dragged them away.
Nobody believes me, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving.
- They're leaving?
- That's what they said.
How long have we been sleeping?
Twelve hours or so.
They said they had poison gas.
They secrete it in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
- But they're leaving?
- They left real fast this morning.
Something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
Listen.
There's things I can take, and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, OK?
I'm serious.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared.
But who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
- If he has another attack...
- I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door.
- Good enough for me.
- Me, too.
Get the syringe as well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
They're doing this on TV.
- They're dancing.
- Yeah, like this.
You want to see it?
I'll bring the TV in here.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, baby.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
- I don't feel much.
- Good.
Tell Morgan to play games.
- It's OK to be silly.
- I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
- He'll always take care of her.
- I will.
- And tell Graham...
- I'm here.
Tell him...
See.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
So you have to ask yourself, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible there are no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Swing away.
That's why you had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him, give him a minute.
Give him a second.
- Daddy?
- Don't touch him.
Don't.
Don't.
Dad?
What happened?
Did someone save me?
Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
...This is not a dr...
... Dad!
Hey...
Honey...
Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
Alright, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father. "
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an arse-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favour.
Alright, listen...
we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy. "
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises. "
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
Alright, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three 1...
... Alright.
2... 3!
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your arse, bitch!
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
It's time for an arse-whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
...You can?
... Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop!
It's hideous!
Get it off!
I
- I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da!
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amoebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but I-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark. "
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
I
- I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O
- Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favourite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm...
I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and... and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something...
what I said in there, it still goes.
Your... your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far... 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favour, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey...
I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world...
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows... covertlike.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing. "
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group... very small...
to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall...
set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o- on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
13!
¶ Don't give me that so-so-soda ¶
¶ That same old cola ¶
¶ I wanna pop ¶ ...¶ Pop, pop I wanna...
Shasta ¶...
I'll take it.
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly... "shits"
and... "bastards. "
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he?
What is it?
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyse Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, alright.
Turn it up.
See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
It's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous!
Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U.S. officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way... is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
She was just sitting there looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her and I realise I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See. "
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away. "
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident...
drunk driving, they weren't sure...
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
...Is he okay?
... Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5.00 a. m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11.00 a. m.
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His...
his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, I- like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now... all over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c... the crop circles.
They could be some kind of... some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate... makes sense.
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realised the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book Bimbu?
... Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason...
they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
Father?
Hello?
I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house...
no one.
Where you going?
...Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment... that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh...
Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such... none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.
Alright.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7 th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Oh!
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy waggon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
Their skin changes colours.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics... hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle 'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?
Is this really happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favour of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favour of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favour of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be 400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack manoeuvre.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like "War of the Worlds. "
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone?
Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
...Stop crying!
...Graham...
... Don't yell at her!
Alright, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she's like an angel. "
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful. "
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad...
Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamt about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamt. "
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
...Dad!
Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
What's happening out there?
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamt this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We're the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean...
pinned?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's... she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out 'cause we... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
...I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I'm serious.
Okay.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now...
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
...They're doing this on TV.
... People are celebrating.
There's a great sense of relief.
...They're dancing.
... Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life, ...Do you want to see it?
... we will be left with a lot of questions.
...I'll bring the TV in here....
I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham...
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
That's why he had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D
- Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't... don't.
Dad?
What happened?
Did someone save me?
Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
...This is not a dr...
Dad!
Hey...
Honey...
Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an ass-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favor.
All right, listen...
we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three 1...
...All right.
2... 3!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your ass, bitch!
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
It's time for an ass-whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
...You can?
...Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop!
It's hideous!
Get it off!
l-I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da!
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but l-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
l-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm...
I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and...
and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something... what I said in there, it still goes.
Your... your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
Woman on radio:
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far... 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Man on radio:
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey...
I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world...
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows... covertlike.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing".
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group... very small...
to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 50 7-footer over the left-field wall...
set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
13!
Don't give me that so-so-soda
That same old cola
I wanna pop ...Pop, pop I wanna...
Shasta ...I'll take it.
Tracey:
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly... "shits"
and..."bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he?
What is it?
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, all right.
Turn it up.
See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
It's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous!
Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. Officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
...The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show "your" children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
...Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
