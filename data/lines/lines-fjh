I was one of your doctors.
You were in a vegetative state when you left here last week.
Addison's disease.
All I needed was cortisol, and my brain turned on like a switch.
This is amazing!
Surprised you didn't know.
How would I know?
Not quite my old self yet.
Baby steps, the doctors tell me.
Now...
With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?
How would I...
I wanna have sex with my wife, and I was hoping that maybe you could...
Viagra?
You're here for Viagra?
A bucketful would be nice.
Dr. Cuddy.
Hi.
It's completely unethical.
He was reckless with a patient.
He was right.
But he didn't know that.
He needs at least some glimmer of humility.
Why does he need that?
Because other people have that?
Why does he need to be like other people?
He needs to be less reckless.
Well, you did it.
He's dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions.
He's in pain.
How much pain?
Why?
You know this is affecting him, don't you?
Telling him that he got his last case right won't do anything to help him.
It'll make him less depressed.
Which might not help his leg.
But you don't know.
Just let me run a PET scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.
If it is, the ketamine isn't working anymore, and he's headed for a huge crash.
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault, and I will tell him the truth.
Too tight?
My parents think I'm crazy.
No, they don't.
They're just worried about you.
That's all.
I'm not weird.
It's just that weird things keep happening to me.
Slight pinch.
If you make me better, do you think the aliens will leave me alone?
I don't think they're gonna be bothering you for much longer.
Are you lying again?
No.
We figure this out, everything's gonna be okay.
Still with us?
Let's go.
Pulmonary edema, stage-two hypertensive crisis.
What is happening?
Wait outside.
Get him oxygen, and start him on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.
Get them outside!
He's in ICU, systolic is hovering around 1 70.
I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.
Trade-off being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke,
MI and blindness.
I'm open to suggestions.
Solve the case.
Kidneys could explain...
Kidneys are clean.
Tell me he's a mutant-human hybrid.
It is a bleeding disorder.
Clancy tested positive for Von Willebrand's.
I didn't screw up.
How could he clot on his own two out of three times?
Maybe he cheated.
Right.
Kids always cheat on their bleeding-time tests.
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.
I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what The Rock was cooking.
I meant, he's clotting right now, and he's in hypertensive crisis.
Maybe the two are related.
What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?
Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors.
Even someone low on Von Willebrand's could theoretically clot.
And the first time Clancy clotted, he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction.
He could've easily been hypertensive.
I know I get worked up when I cut microchip tracking implants out of my neck.
Sounds like a cheat to me.
Yeah, we get it.
Okay, what's the differential for a seven-year-old boy suffering multiple hypertensive crises?
We think the problem is in your son's heart.
We need to do a procedure called a transesophageal echo.
Okay, and that will fix his heart?
That will tell us where the problem is, hopefully.
Then we can fix him.
Listen, this isn't really part of my job, but he's worried that you think he's crazy.
Well, isn't he?
There are still plenty of other explanations for what's going on.
It's important he knows you believe in him, even if you don't.
It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.
Why don't I have a high-def in my office?
I'm a department head.
There are no structural defects.
Valves are intact.
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Foreman, you gotta steal this thing for me.
Let me ring up one of the homies.
The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears.
The problem's gotta be somewhere else.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
You're wrong, House.
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?
There.
Where?
Right there.
Left side, no movement.
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.
How do you see something not move if nothing's moving?
I need a laser pointer.
We don't have a laser pointer.
Well, why not?
Who's gonna take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer?
Right here.
A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest.
So you've found an arrhythmia?
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhtyhmia.
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.
Go get me those myocytes.
I wanna talk to them in my office.
How's the kid doing?
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.
Most of it, anyway.
Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click, "Yes, I am 18?"
Even a 1 7-year-old can figure that out.
What's going on with the leg?
First, tell me what's going on with the boobs.
If you're feeling pain...
They're firmer.
It's called an underwire.
I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
I think it's hormones.
As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus...
Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
...then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.
After you workout, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.
Guess I should be saying, "Mazel tov".
Who gets to pass out the cigars?
I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.
Boy or girl?
You got a name picked out?
I'm not pregnant.
My leg doesn't hurt.
You're in denial.
No, I'm not!
Oh, you got me.
If I thought that my leg was deteriorating, don't you think I'd want to take steps to prevent that?
Okay.
Gotta go.
Here's Clancy's DNA.
And here's the DNA from that piece of his heart we just biopsied.
That is impossible.
Run it again.
We already did and once more after that.
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body.
Alien DNA.
Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.
That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.
Nitrous acid or ethidium-bromide exposure.
First, Daddy was a rapist.
Now he's a chemist.
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia or both.
Is your leg hurting?
Is that question helping?
You're leaning.
You're sitting.
You're evading.
My head's hurting.
Please, someone, give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA.
We could search his home for toxins, fungals and radiation.
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with strep, we don't conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from.
We cure it.
We know he's got the stuff inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.
Where do we cut?
Chances are, it's not just in his heart.
Well, we got lucky with the heart.
Myocytes contract.
We could see that these weren't working.
I don't know how the hell we're gonna find it anywhere else.
What if we take the heart cells with the bad DNA, and we tag them?
Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
It's the same way we search for cancer.
The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells.
We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein, we flush it throughout his system, and the similar cells light up like light bulbs.
Okay, let's do that.
You have to tell him.
He said he wasn't in any pain.
He's lying.
Of course he's lying.
We need another plan.
Don't talk about it that way.
What way?
"Plan."
It sounds like we're conspiring against him.
I'm gonna tell him.
No, you're not.
Then come up with a cunning plan and fast.
She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is.
What's this machine do?
Makes a lot of noise, and it's gonna help us figure out what's wrong with you.
You think House has lost a step?
He's fine.
There.
Clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur.
Explains the intermittent-bleeding disorder.
'Cause I don't need to subject myself to House's torture if there's no upside.
I'm telling you, he's fine.
We missed some affected cells in his heart.
Explains the continuing hypertensive issues.
You said the last case really threw him, and now suddenly...
I was wrong.
So you changed your mind.
Why?
His brilliant ideas on this case have all been yours.
There's the reason for him needing glasses.
Apparently, it's a symptom.
It means the condition predates...
You don't change your mind without a reason.
Now, what do you know?
House didn't blow the last case.
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.
Cuddy and Wilson are trying to teach him some humility.
Scan is complete.
Three hot spots, but nothing in his brain.
House's original theory was right.
It is not neurological.
Is he going to be able to walk?
His leg should be functional after some rehab.
"Functional"?
What does that mean?
He'll be able to walk, but not run?
He'll have a limp?
If everything goes well, he'll walk.
He'll run.
He'll probably be even stronger than he is now.
When we close him up, we'll move over to his other leg, snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart.
Once the affected areas are removed, his normal tissue will step back in, do its job.
He should have no more problems with his blood pressure.
After confirming those areas are clear, we'll start the final procedure.
We're gonna insert a needle through the pupil and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina.
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?
Yeah, it's clear.
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.
Thank you.
Do you wanna go for a run?
What do you want?
I want you to run.
When did you become an enabler?
I'm enabling you to exercise.
Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab, muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.
I'd rather not become dependent on pain pills to get through my day.
You're just like any other patient, running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
You're scared the ketamine treatment's wearing off, that it was just a torturous window to the good life.
What part of "poop" didn't you understand?
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?
It's my leg.
We've known each other a long time.
You're not always right, House.
You've proven that lately.
What's happening to him?
He's seizing.
I need clonazepam.
I thought you got it all.
Yeah, yell at me.
That'll fix your kid.
Obviously, we missed some foreign tissue.
There's something still in him.
The hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe.
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you're wrong again.
We didn't miss anything.
Brain scan was completely clean.
Our tag must not have penetrated the blood-brain barrier.
Don't use an IV this time.
Get it right into the brain.
No cells are lighting up.
His brain is clean.
It is not neurological.
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.
What if it is there, but didn't show up on the scan?
What if the tag just doesn't work in his brain?
Brain cells are structurally different, express a different protein.
So how do we find it?
Where are we going?
I am going to think.
Send the kid home.
What do you mean?
Make sure his blood pressure's stabilized, and send him home.
What, like nothing ever happened?
We cured his bleeding disorder, removed all the damaged cells we could find.
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.
Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.
It's more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
He had a convulsion.
May be epilepsy.
May be psychological.
May be nothing.
If the kid gets sick again, it'll give us another clue.
We can start searching again.
If he doesn't, doesn't matter.
Send him home.
House.
You're just giving up on this kid?
You gotta know when to stop.
You don't stop.
You never stop.
You just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.
Except on my last case.
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.
This kid obviously has something wrong with him.
When did you develop such strong opinions about my patients?
Last week, you were convinced my patient wasn't sick.
Now you're convinced this one is.
This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.
Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours...
Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg.
That's where we found most of it.
Maybe we should just remove his affected eye completely.
If you have reason to believe that that might help...
I'm not gonna start lopping off body parts, but it's interesting that you give me the green light.
I just want you to do something.
You've been overly supportive this entire week.
Either you're hormonal, or you're guilt-ridden, and it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
I'm not pregnant.
Then what did you do wrong?
He had Addison's.
Your last patient.
You were right.
I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.
Oh, your mommy is in such trouble.
She's such a liar.
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...
How does one person end up with two different sets of DNA?
We've been through this.
Our assumptions are faulty.
We've confirmed two different sets of DNA.
We re-ran the sequence.
I didn't say the lab work was faulty.
I said our assumptions were faulty.
We assumed he's a person.
Of course.
The aliens didn't just visit him.
They replaced him.
You're being silly.
What if he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?
I'm not getting the metaphor.
No metaphor.
Chase, you said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?
Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
Kid was right all along.
He was implanted with something, back when he was young.
I mean really young, like 1 2-cells young.
In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.
But he doesn't have a twin.
Not walking around.
But in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop, so doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth.
Problem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.
Two brothers get stuck sharing.
There's no bunk beds, so they cuddle up to keep warm, and they never untangle.
He's two people in one.
It's called chimerism.
Unfortunately, his brother's like a bad doubles partner.
The guy just takes up space, gets in the way.
Clancy's body thinks that he's gonna put away the easy winners.
His brother just keeps swatting balls into the net.
We gotta get him off the court.
So does that mean that you can find the bad cells in his brain or not?
Sure, abandon the metaphor.
Fine.
Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks.
If we induce an alien abduction...
Wait.
What the hell are you talking about?
The foreign DNA has got to be in a portion of your son's brain that makes him believe that he's being abducted.
If we stimulate those neurons with an electric probe, we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating.
Your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will remain dark.
Those are the ones we cut out.
You're talking about brain surgery.
I'm talking about really cool brain surgery.
One of your sons will die, but the taller one won't be so annoying anymore.
So I have a twin?
Not really.
What's on the card?
A light bulb.
Start us out at 10.
I'm not doing that.
That was all me, kid.
Sorry.
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.
He lives inside me?
Sort of.
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.
You're in sensory.
You're getting closer.
What do you see on this one?
Moon and stars.
So I am kind of weird?
We're all kind of weird.
No!
Clancy?
We got something.
What do you see?
The light.
Here they come, I think.
Brain waves indicate a mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.
Any dark spots?
Area's too fuzzy.
Hallucination isn't strong enough.
Turn up the juice.
His blood pressure's already 160 over 1 10.
Any higher...
Riding the short bus is better than not breathing.
Take us to 100.
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.
Crank it up higher.
You've already exceeded the preset maximum.
Next step's brain damage.
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.
Clancy?
Can you hear me?
Clancy?
You got them.
Yep.
We got them all.
Close him up.
Everything's gonna be normal again.
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?
What now?
She lied to me.
She cured my patient with my diagnosis, then lied to me about it.
That doesn't sound like her.
You're right.
Does sound like you, though.
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?
Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.
So what was the plan?
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case that I'd reevaluate my entire life, question the nature of truth and goodness and become Cameron?
Something like that.
More that if we told you the truth, that you solved a case based on absolutely no medical proof, you'd think you were God.
And I was worried your wings would melt.
God doesn't limp.
Mom!
- I'm thirsty.
- I just gave you water.
I want juice.
It's bedtime.
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
Mom!
What do you want, Clance?
Hi, Dad.
Go to bed.
- Can I turn the TV on?
- TV is only for the daytime.
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.
Go to bed.
Dad, what if...
What if they come to get me again?
Nobody is coming to get you.
OK?
Go to bed.
Now.
Come on, Clancy.
It's time to get up.
- I guess he's already up.
- That's a first.
I-I will, uh, I'll see if he needs breakfast.
Hey, Clance, you hungry?
Hon, he's not down here.
You sure?
Clancy?
Clancy?
Where are you?
- Sweetie, are you hiding?
- Clancy?
Where is he?
You're gonna be in big trouble when I find you.
Honey, come out right now, wherever you are.
This is not funny.
House S03E02 Cane and Able
Where's the sweat and the B.O.?
You've taken such pride in bathing us all in your musk.
- Showered at home.
- And yet you're earlier than usual.
Is this an intervention?
It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore.
I am, however, still hooked on phonics.
If you did your morning run and showered at home, you'd be later than usual.
Thought of you in the shower.
How's your leg?
You seem to be favoring your left side.
I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday.
- Makes all the difference in the world.
- You've taken the stairs every day.
- Did I need a restraining order?
- You slack on your rehab, the muscle will weaken.
And your leg will hurt again.
Looks like the Ketamine treatment might not stick.
Or maybe we've made him depressed because we're lying to him.
- Telling him he got that case wrong.
- We didn't hurt him.
The pain isn't...
He gets depressed, he stops exercising.
He stops exercising, the muscle atrophies.
The muscle atrophies, the pain returns.
Maybe he stopped exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.
The Ketamine could work perfectly and he would still be back on his cane popping Vicodin again.
You can't tell him.
He got lucky.
There was no medical...
He was right.
We tell him he was right, and we're feeding his addiction.
Without Vicodin, he's only got one to focus on.
- Well, he's not gonna O.D. on puzzles.
- No, it's not gonna hurt him.
But he could just as easily have killed that patient.
We have a tiny window of time here where House may be healthy enough to change.
And based on that limp, the window's closing fast.
Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy.
Had all his vaccinations.
Fractured his right ulna at age three, chicken pox at age five...
Did he ever get his feelings hurt?
I'll need to know that too.
You are 0 for 1 since you came back.
We just wanna make sure...
Rectal bleeding plus alien abduction fantasies, most likely sexual abuse.
Penetration causes the bleed, trauma causes the fantasy.
E. R. ran a rape kit, found no evidence of tearing, semen, or pubic hairs.
I think we should talk to the kid.
Why?
In case he's telling the truth?
You're a believer, aren't you?
I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy and ten million billion planets in the universe, that we're the only ones with life.
No.
But
I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our backdoors.
There is new research indicating a link between neurological problems
- and bleeding disorders.
- Perfect.
Especially if there were neurological problems.
What part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?
- It wasn't a hallucination.
- What?
- You think the kid...
- Is having nightmares.
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything other than wanting to sleep with mommy.
Which just leaves us with one symptom, the bloody tuchus.
Which can easily be explained by a G. I. problem or a bleeding disorder.
Check his coags with a PT, PTT, and bleeding time.
Prep him for endoscopies from above and below.
Gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm, okay?
Then I'm gonna time how long it takes for you to stop bleeding.
This is gonna sting a little, so you might want to look the other way.
Are those windows locked?
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.
Good. 'Cause they know I'm here.
Clancy... don't bother the doctor with this stuff.
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?
They put a chip in my neck so they can keep track of me.
I can feel it back there.
Clancy, you know there is nothing back there.
- There is.
- Let me see.
Lean forwards.
And they have this other thing.
And they put it... in between these two ribs.
Always on this side.
And then they move it around my insides.
- It hurts.
- You know what, Clancy?
I think I might have found the chip back there.
And I think I might be able to get it out.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
Okay, lean forwards.
Now hold very still, okay?
Got it.
I'm seven... not three.
All you did was pinch my neck.
Sorry.
His alien abduction story, the level of detail is...
I don't know where he gets it from.
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books.
Great.
You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.
So, it's a simple bleeding disorder.
No.
Blood tests were all normal.
And he clotted in six minutes.
So it's a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.
I didn't screw up the test.
So it's a U.F.O.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.
Either you screwed up the test or I screwed up my analysis of this case.
If you screwed up, I don't have to cry myself to sleep.
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.
How could I screw up a simple bleeding time test?
Maybe you were abducted and lost time.
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.
You're sure?
I had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.
So you're saying Chase did screw up.
Or Foreman screwed up.
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playin' the dozens.
You're at a huge cultural disadvantage here, Chase.
Take a couple minutes to think of a witty retort.
So we have contradicting bleeding time tests.
If we run labs to check his clotting fac- tors, we can confirm which one's right.
Yeah, testing.
Nice idea.
Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent.
Looks better in the paperwork too.
Hey, Foreman, your mama's so fat, when her beeper goes off, people think she's backing up.
Where's Clancy?
He's asleep.
He's...
House!
Clancy's gone missing.
Oh, no!
You take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on Tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint.
Let's pray he hasn't gone into hyperdrive.
We'll never catch him.
Clancy?
I had to go where there are no windows so I could get the chip out like you said.
God.
- I can feel it, I just can't grab it.
- Clancy, stop!
There is no chip.
We're gonna clean you up and we're gonna go back to your room.
You can't do things like this.
Your parents--
Results came back.
The lab cannot identify the metal.
Said it might not even be terrestrial.
- Really?
- No, you idiot, it's titanium.
Like from a surgical pin.
Like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago.
- Nice medical history.
- That pin was removed six months after.
So a little piece broke off during removal.
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.
Tell that to guys on the Kursk.
And how exactly did it get from his arm to the back of his neck?
Body attacks any foreign object.
Inflammatory reaction could erode it into a vein, fragment gets a free ride.
To his lungs, maybe.
Not his neck.
Yeah, an alien chip makes more sense.
The real mystery is that you didn't actually screw up.
You okay?
Fine.
Tripped.
Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck and apparently didn't bleed to death.
- Now, that's weird.
- He clotted on his own?
Sure did.
So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there is not again.
- Which is impossible.
- Or Foreman screwed up.
Two out of three tests agree with my findings.
Well, lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.
So you're just gonna keep cutting him?
Until what?
This test is different.
We draw some blood and see if any clotting factors are low or missing.
But why haven't the other tests--
We've got three results that haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.
Or two of them.
Is it possible the problem isn't his blood?
It's just psychological.
- I mean, he almost killed himself.
- He wasn't trying to hurt himself.
No... he was just looking for an alien tracking device.
I have time for one more.
Don't blame you for spending extra time down here.
Heard the artist formerly known as gimp is back upstairs.
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.
She's busy.
I'll take it.
Oh, my God.
You're...
How...
You're okay.
Have we met?
I was one of your doctors.
You were in a vegetative state when you left here last week.
Addison's disease.
All I needed was cortisol and my brain turned on like a switch.
- This is amazing.
- Surprised
- you didn't know.
- How would I know?
Not quite my old self yet.
- Baby steps, the doctors tell me.
- With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?
- How would I...
- I wanna have sex with my wife.
And I was hoping that maybe...
- You could...
- Viagra?
- You're here for Viagra?
- A bucketful would be nice.
Dr. Cuddy.
- It's completely unethical.
- He was reckless with a patient.
- He was right.
- But he didn't know that.
He needs at least some glimmer of humility.
Why does he need that?
Because other people have that?
Why does he need to be like other people?
- He needs to be less reckless.
- Well, you did it.
He's dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions.
He's in pain.
- How much pain?
- Why?
You know this is affecting him, don't you?
Telling him that he got his last case right won't do anything to help him.
- It'll make him less depressed.
- Which might not help his leg.
But you don't know.
Just let me run a PET scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.
If it is, the Ketamine isn't working any- more and he's headed for a huge crash.
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault and I will tell him the truth.
Too tight?
- My parents think I'm crazy.
- No, they don't.
They're just worried about you, that's all.
I'm not weird.
It's just that weird things keep happening to me.
Slight pinch.
If you make me better, do you think the aliens will leave me alone?
I don't think they're gonna be bothering you for much longer.
- You lying again?
- No.
We figure this out, everything's gonna be okay.
You still with us?
Pulmonary edema, stage two hypertensive crisis.
- What is happening?
- Wait outside.
Get him oxygen.
Start him on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.
Get them outside!
He's in ICU.
Systolic is hovering around 170.
I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.
The trade-off being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke,
- M. I., and blindness.
- I'm open to suggestions.
Solve the case.
- Kidneys could explain...
- Kidneys are clean.
Tell me he's a mutant/human hybrid.
It is a bleeding disorder.
Clancy tested positive for Von Willebrand's.
I didn't screw up.
How could he clot on his own two out of three times?
- Maybe he cheated.
- Right.
Kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.
I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking.
I meant he's clotting right now and he's in hypertensive crisis.
Maybe the two are related.
What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?
Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors.
Someone low on Von Willebrands could theoretically clot.
And the first time Clancy clotted, he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction.
He could have easily been hypertensive.
I know I get worked up when I cut micro- chip tracking implants out of my neck.
- Sounds like a cheat to me.
- Yeah, we get it.
Okay, what's the differential for seven-year-old boys suffering multiple hypertensive crises?
We think the problem is in your son's heart.
We need to do a procedure called a transesophegeal echo.
Okay, and that will fix his heart?
That will tell us where the problem is.
Hopefully.
Then we can fix him.
Listen... this isn't really part of my job, but... he's worried that you think he's crazy.
Well, isn't he?
There are still plenty of other explanations for what's going on.
It's important he knows you believe in him.
Even if you don't.
It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.
Why don't I have a hi-def in my office?
I'm a department head.
- There are no structural defects.
- Valves are intact.
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Foreman, you gotta steal this thing for me.
Let me ring up one of the homies.
The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears.
The problem's got to be somewhere else.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
You're wrong, House.
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?
- There.
- Where?
Right there.
Left side.
No movement.
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.
How do you see something not move if nothing's moving?
I need a laser pointer.
- We don't have a laser pointer.
- Well, why not?
Who's gonna take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer?
Right... here.
A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest.
So you found an arrhythmia.
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhythmia.
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.
Go get me those myocytes.
I want to talk to them in my office.
How's the kid doing?
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.
Most of it anyway.
Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click "Yes, I am 18"?
Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.
What's going on with the leg?
First tell me what's going on with the boobs.
- If you're feeling pain...
- They're firmer.
It's called an underwire.
- I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
- I think it's hormones.
As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus--
Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
Then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.
After you work out, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the Ketamine failed.
Guess I should be saying mazel tov.
- Who gets to pass out the cigars?
- I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.
Boy or girl?
You got a name picked out?
- I'm not pregnant.
- My leg doesn't hurt.
- You're in denial.
- No, I'm not!
Oh, you got me.
If I thought that my leg was deteriorating,
Don't you think I'd want to take steps to prevent that?
Okay.
Gotta go.
Here's Clancy's DNA.
And here's the DNA from that piece of his heart we just biopsied.
That is impossible.
- Run it again.
- We already did.
And once more after that.
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body.
Alien DNA.
Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.
That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.
Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.
First daddy was a rapist, now he's a chemist.
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia or both.
- Is your leg hurting?
- Is that question helping?
- You're leaning.
- You're sitting.
- You're evading.
- My head's hurting.
Please, someone give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA.
We could search his home for toxins, fungals, and radiation.
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with a strep, we don't conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from, we cure it.
We know he's got this inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.
Where do we cut?
Chances are it's not just in his heart.
We got lucky with the heart.
Myocytes contract, we could see that these weren't working.
I don't know how the hell we're gonna find it anywhere else.
What if we take the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?
Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
It's the same way we search for cancer.
The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells.
We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein.
We flush it throughout his system and the similar cells light up like... lightbulbs.
Okay.
Let's do that.
- You have to tell him.
- He said he wasn't in any pain.
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- We need another plan.
- Don't talk about it that way.
What way?
Plan.
Sounds like we're conspiring against him.
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No, you're not.
Then come up with a cunning plan and fast.
She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is.
What's this machine do?
It makes a lot of noise.
And it's gonna help us figure out what's wrong with you.
You think House has lost a step?
He's fine.
There, a clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur.
Explains the intermittent bleeding disorder.
'Cause I don't need to subject myself to House's torture if there's no upside.
I'm telling you, he's fine.
We missed some affected cells in his heart.
Explains the continuing hypertensive issues.
You said the last case really threw him.
And now suddenly...
I was wrong.
So you changed your mind.
Why?
His brilliant ideas on this case have all been yours.
There's the reason for him needing glasses.
Apparently it's a symptom.
Means the condition predates--
You don't change your mind without a reason.
What do you know?
House... didn't blow the last case.
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.
Cuddy and Wilson are trying to teach him some humility.
Scan is complete.
Three hot spots, but nothing in his brain.
House's original theory was right.
It is not neurological.
Is he gonna be able to walk?
His leg should be functional after some rehab.
Functional?
What does that mean?
He's be able to walk but not run?
He'll have a limp?
If everything goes well, he'll walk, he'll run.
He'll probably be even stronger than he is now.
When we close him up, we'll move over to his other leg.
Snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart.
Once the affected areas are removed, his normal tissue will set back in and do its job.
He should have no more problems with his blood pressure.
After confirming those areas are clear, we'll start the final procedure.
I'm gonna insert a needle through the pupil and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina.
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?
Yeah.
It's clear.
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.
Thank you.
You wanna go for a run?
What do you want?
I want you to run.
When did you become an enabler?
I'm enabling you to exercise.
Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab.
Muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.
I'd rather not become dependent on pain pills to get through my day.
You're just like any other patient.
Running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
You're scared the Ketamine treatment's wearing off.
That it was just a.... torturous window to the good life.
What part of poop didn't you understand?
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?
It's my leg.
We've known each other a long time.
You're not always right, House.
You've proven that lately.
- What's happening to him?
- He's seizing.
I need clonazepam.
I thought you got it all!
Yeah, yell at me.
That'll fix the kid.
Obviously we missed some foreign tissue.
There's something still in him.
The hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe.
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you were wrong, again.
We didn't miss anything.
The brain scan was completely clean.
Our tag must not have penetrated the blood brain barrier.
Don't use an IV this time, get it right into the brain.
No cells are lighting up.
His brain is clean.
It is not neurological.
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.
What if it is there, but didn't show up on the scan?
What if the tag just doesn't work in his brain?
Brain cells are structurally different.
They express a different protein.
So how do we find it?
Where are we going?
I am going to think.
Send the kid home.
What do you mean?
Make sure his blood pressure is stabilized and send him home.
- Like nothing ever happened?
- We cured his bleeding disorder and removed all the damaged cells we could find.
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.
Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.
It's more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
He had a convulsion.
Maybe epilepsy, maybe psychological.
Maybe nothing.
If the kid gets sick again, that'll give us another clue and we'll start searching again.
If he doesn't, it doesn't matter.
Send him home.
House!
You're just giving up on this kid?
You gotta know when to stop.
You don't stop.
You never stop, you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.
Except on my last case.
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.
This kid obviously has something wrong with him.
When did you develop such strong opinions about my patients?
Last week you were convinced that my patient wasn't sick.
- Now you're convinced this one is.
- This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.
Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours...
Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg.
It's where we found most of it.
Maybe we should just remove his affected eye completely.
If you have reason to believe that that might help...
I'm not gonna start lopping off body parts.
But it's interesting that you give me the green light.
I just want you to do something.
You've been overly supportive this entire week.
Well, either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden.
And it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
- I'm not pregnant.
- Then what did you do wrong?
He had Addison's.
Your last patient.
You were right.
I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip Van Winkle.
Oh, your mommy's in such trouble.
She's such a liar.
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...
How does one person... end up with two different sets of DNA?
- We've been through this.
- Our assumptions are faulty.
We've confirmed two different sets of DNA.
We re-ran the sequence.
I didn't say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty.
We assumed he's a person.
Of course.
The aliens didn't just visit him, they replaced him.
You're being silly.
What if he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?
- I'm not getting the metaphor.
- No metaphor.
Chase said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?
- Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
- Kid was right all along.
He was implanted with something.
Back when he was young.
I mean, really young.
Like 12 cells young.
In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.
But he doesn't have a twin.
Not walking around...
But in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop.
So doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth.
The problem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.
Two brothers get stuck sharing, but there's no bunk beds.
So they cuddle up to keep warm and they never untangle.
He's two people in one.
It's called chimerism.
Unfortunately, his brother's... like a bad doubles partner.
The guy just takes up space, gets in the way.
Clancy's body thinks he's gonna put away the easy winners, his brother just keeps swatting the balls into the net.
We gotta get him off the court.
So does that mean that you can find the bad cells in his brain or not?
Sure, abandon the metaphor.
Fine.
Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks.
If we induce an alien abduction...
Wait, what the hell are you talking about?
The foreign DNA has got to be in the portion of your son's brain that makes him believe that he's being abducted.
If we stimulate those neurons with an electric probe, we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating.
Your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will remain dark.
Those are the ones we cut out.
You're talking about brain surgery.
I'm talking about really cool brain surgery.
One of your sons will die.
But the taller one won't be so annoying anymore.
- So I have a twin?
- Not really.
What's on the card?
Light bulb.
Start us out at ten.
I'm not doing that.
It was all me, kid.
Sorry.
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.
- He lives inside me.
- Sort of.
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.
You're in sensory.
Getting closer.
- What do you see on this one?
- Moon and stars.
So...
I am kind of weird?
We're all kind of weird.
No!
- Clancy?
- We got something.
- What do you see?
- The light.
Here they come.
I think.
Brain waves indicate mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.
- Any dark spots?
- Area's too fuzzy.
Hallucination isn't strong enough.
Turn up the juice.
His blood pressure's already at 160 over 110.
Any higher and...
Riding the short bus is better than not breathing.
Take us to 100.
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.
Crank it up higher.
You've already exceeded the pre-set maximum.
Next step's brain damage.
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.
Clancy, can you hear me?
Clancy?
You got them.
We got 'em all.
Close him up.
Everything's gonna be normal again.
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?
What now?
She lied to me.
She cured my patient with my diagnosis, then she lied to me about it.
- That doesn't sound like her.
- You're right.
Does sound like you, though.
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?
Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.
So what was the plan?
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case that I'd re-evaluate my entire life, question the nature of truth and goodness,
- and become Cameron?
- Something like that.
More that if we told you the truth, that you'd solved a case based on absolutely no medical proof,
you'd think you were God.
And I was worried your wings would melt.
God doesn't limp.

Mom!
- I'm thirsty.
- I just gave you water.
I want juice.
It's bedtime.
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
Mom!
What do you want, Clance?
Hi, Dad.
Go to bed.
- Can I turn the TV on?
- TV is only for the daytime.
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.
Go to bed.
Dad, what if...
What if they come to get me again?
Nobody is coming to get you.
OK?
Go to bed.
Now.
Come on, Clancy.
It's time to get up.
- I guess he's already up.
- That's a first.
I-I will, uh, I'll see if he needs breakfast.
Hey, Clance, you hungry?
Hon, he's not down here.
You sure?
Clancy?
Clancy?
Where are you?
- Sweetie, are you hiding?
- Clancy?
Where is he?
You're gonna be in big trouble when I find you.
Honey, come out right now, wherever you are.
This is not funny.

Where's the sweat and the B.O.?
You've taken such pride in bathing us all in your musk.
- Showered at home.
- And yet you're earlier than usual.
Is this an intervention?
It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore.
I am, however, still hooked on phonics.
If you did your morning run and showered at home, you'd be later than usual.
Thought of you in the shower.
How's your leg?
You seem to be favoring your left side.
I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday.
- Makes all the difference in the world.
- You've taken the stairs every day.
- Did I need a restraining order?
- You slack on your rehab, the muscle will weaken.
And your leg will hurt again.
Looks like the Ketamine treatment might not stick.
Or maybe we've made him depressed because we're lying to him.
- Telling him he got that case wrong.
- We didn't hurt him.
The pain isn't...
He gets depressed, he stops exercising.
He stops exercising, the muscle atrophies.
The muscle atrophies, the pain returns.
Maybe he stopped exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.
The Ketamine could work perfectly and he would still be back on his cane popping Vicodin again.
You can't tell him.
He got lucky.
There was no medical...
He was right.
We tell him he was right, and we're feeding his addiction.
Without Vicodin, he's only got one to focus on.
- Well, he's not gonna O.D. on puzzles.
- No, it's not gonna hurt him.
But he could just as easily have killed that patient.
We have a tiny window of time here where House may be healthy enough to change.
And based on that limp, the window's closing fast.
Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy.
Had all his vaccinations.
Fractured his right ulna at age three, chicken pox at age five...
Did he ever get his feelings hurt?
I'll need to know that too.
You are 0 for 1 since you came back.
We just wanna make sure...
Rectal bleeding plus alien abduction fantasies, most likely sexual abuse.
Penetration causes the bleed, trauma causes the fantasy.
E. R. ran a rape kit, found no evidence of tearing, semen, or pubic hairs.
I think we should talk to the kid.
Why?
In case he's telling the truth?
You're a believer, aren't you?
I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy and ten million billion planets in the universe, that we're the only ones with life.
No.
But
I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our backdoors.
There is new research indicating a link between neurological problems
- and bleeding disorders.
- Perfect.
Especially if there were neurological problems.
What part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?
- It wasn't a hallucination.
- What?
- You think the kid...
- Is having nightmares.
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything other than wanting to sleep with mommy.
Which just leaves us with one symptom, the bloody tuchus.
Which can easily be explained by a G. I. problem or a bleeding disorder.
Check his coags with a PT, PTT, and bleeding time.
Prep him for endoscopies from above and below.
Gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm, okay?
Then I'm gonna time how long it takes for you to stop bleeding.
This is gonna sting a little, so you might want to look the other way.
Are those windows locked?
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.
Good. 'Cause they know I'm here.
Clancy... don't bother the doctor with this stuff.
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?
They put a chip in my neck so they can keep track of me.
I can feel it back there.
Clancy, you know there is nothing back there.
- There is.
- Let me see.
Lean forwards.
And they have this other thing.
And they put it... in between these two ribs.
Always on this side.
And then they move it around my insides.
- It hurts.
- You know what, Clancy?
I think I might have found the chip back there.
And I think I might be able to get it out.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
Okay, lean forwards.
Now hold very still, okay?
Got it.
I'm seven... not three.
All you did was pinch my neck.
Sorry.
His alien abduction story, the level of detail is...
I don't know where he gets it from.
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books.
Great.
You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.
So, it's a simple bleeding disorder.
No.
Blood tests were all normal.
And he clotted in six minutes.
So it's a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.
I didn't screw up the test.
So it's a U.F.O.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.
Either you screwed up the test or I screwed up my analysis of this case.
If you screwed up, I don't have to cry myself to sleep.
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.
How could I screw up a simple bleeding time test?
Maybe you were abducted and lost time.
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.
You're sure?
I had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.
So you're saying Chase did screw up.
Or Foreman screwed up.
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playin' the dozens.
You're at a huge cultural disadvantage here, Chase.
Take a couple minutes to think of a witty retort.
So we have contradicting bleeding time tests.
If we run labs to check his clotting fac- tors, we can confirm which one's right.
Yeah, testing.
Nice idea.
Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent.
Looks better in the paperwork too.
Hey, Foreman, your mama's so fat, when her beeper goes off, people think she's backing up.
Where's Clancy?
He's asleep.
He's...
House!
Clancy's gone missing.
Oh, no!
You take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on Tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint.
Let's pray he hasn't gone into hyperdrive.
We'll never catch him.
Clancy?
I had to go where there are no windows so I could get the chip out like you said.
God.
- I can feel it, I just can't grab it.
- Clancy, stop!
There is no chip.
We're gonna clean you up and we're gonna go back to your room.
You can't do things like this.
Your parents--
Said it might not even be terrestrial.
- Really?
- No, you idiot, it's titanium.
Like from a surgical pin.
Like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago.
- Nice medical history.
- That pin was removed six months after.
So a little piece broke off during removal.
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.
Tell that to guys on the Kursk.
And how exactly did it get from his arm to the back of his neck?
Body attacks any foreign object.
Inflammatory reaction could erode it into a vein, fragment gets a free ride.
To his lungs, maybe.
Not his neck.
Yeah, an alien chip makes more sense.
The real mystery is that you didn't actually screw up.
You okay?
Fine.
Tripped.
Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck and apparently didn't bleed to death.
- Now, that's weird.
- He clotted on his own?
Sure did.
So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there is not again.
- Which is impossible.
- Or Foreman screwed up.
Two out of three tests agree with my findings.
Well, lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.
So you're just gonna keep cutting him?
Until what?
This test is different.
We draw some blood and see if any clotting factors are low or missing.
But why haven't the other tests--
We've got three results that haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.
Or two of them.
Is it possible the problem isn't his blood?
It's just psychological.
- I mean, he almost killed himself.
- He wasn't trying to hurt himself.
No... he was just looking for an alien tracking device.
I have time for one more.
Don't blame you for spending extra time down here.
Heard the artist formerly known as gimp is back upstairs.
Oh, my God.
You're...
How...
You're okay.
Have we met?
I was one of your doctors.
You were in a vegetative state when you left here last week.
Addison's disease.
- you didn't know.
- How would I know?
Not quite my old self yet.
- Baby steps, the doctors tell me.
- With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?
- How would I...
- I wanna have sex with my wife.
And I was hoping that maybe...
- You could...
- Viagra?
- You're here for Viagra?
- A bucketful would be nice.
Dr. Cuddy.
- It's completely unethical.
- He was reckless with a patient.
- He was right.
- But he didn't know that.
He needs at least some glimmer of humility.
Why does he need that?
Because other people have that?
Why does he need to be like other people?
- He needs to be less reckless.
- Well, you did it.
He's dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions.
He's in pain.
- How much pain?
- Why?
You know this is affecting him, don't you?
Telling him that he got his last case right won't do anything to help him.
- It'll make him less depressed.
- Which might not help his leg.
But you don't know.
Just let me run a PET scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.
If it is, the Ketamine isn't working any- more and he's headed for a huge crash.
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault and I will tell him the truth.
Too tight?
- My parents think I'm crazy.
- No, they don't.
They're just worried about you, that's all.
I'm not weird.
It's just that weird things keep happening to me.
Slight pinch.
If you make me better, do you think the aliens will leave me alone?
I don't think they're gonna be bothering you for much longer.
- You lying again?
- No.
We figure this out, everything's gonna be okay.
You still with us?
Pulmonary edema, stage two hypertensive crisis.
- What is happening?
- Wait outside.
Get him oxygen.
Start him on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.
Get them outside!
He's in ICU.
Systolic is hovering around 170.
I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.
The trade-off being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke,
- M. I., and blindness.
- I'm open to suggestions.
Solve the case.
- Kidneys could explain...
- Kidneys are clean.
Tell me he's a mutant/human hybrid.
It is a bleeding disorder.
Clancy tested positive for Von Willebrand's.
I didn't screw up.
How could he clot on his own two out of three times?
- Maybe he cheated.
- Right.
Kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.
I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking.
I meant he's clotting right now and he's in hypertensive crisis.
Maybe the two are related.
What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?
Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors.
Someone low on Von Willebrands could theoretically clot.
And the first time Clancy clotted, he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction.
He could have easily been hypertensive.
I know I get worked up when I cut micro- chip tracking implants out of my neck.
- Sounds like a cheat to me.
- Yeah, we get it.
Okay, what's the differential for seven-year-old boys suffering multiple hypertensive crises?
We think the problem is in your son's heart.
We need to do a procedure called a transesophegeal echo.
Okay, and that will fix his heart?
That will tell us where the problem is.
Hopefully.
Then we can fix him.
L isten... this isn't really part of my job, but... he's worried that you think he's crazy.
Well, isn't he?
There are still plenty of other explanations for what's going on.
It's important he knows you believe in him.
Even if you don't.
It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.
Why don't I have a hi-def in my office?
I'm a department head.
- There are no structural defects.
- Valves are intact.
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Foreman, you gotta steal this thing for me.
Let me ring up one of the homies.
The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears.
The problem's got to be somewhere else.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
You're wrong, House.
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?
- There.
- Where?
Right there.
Left side.
No movement.
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.
How do you see something not move if nothing's moving?
I need a laser pointer.
- We don't have a laser pointer.
- Well, why not?
Who's gonna take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer?
Right... here.
A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest.
So you found an arrhythmia.
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhythmia.
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.
Go get me those myocytes.
I want to talk to them in my office.
How's the kid doing?
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.
Most of it anyway.
Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click "Yes, I am 18"?
Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.
What's going on with the leg?
First tell me what's going on with the boobs.
- If you're feeling pain...
- They're firmer.
It's called an underwire.
- I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
- I think it's hormones.
As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus--
Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
Then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.
After you work out, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the Ketamine failed.
Guess I should be saying mazel tov.
- Who gets to pass out the cigars?
- I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.
Boy or girl?
You got a name picked out?
- I'm not pregnant.
- My leg doesn't hurt.
- You're in denial.
- No, I'm not!
Oh, you got me.
If I thought that my leg was deteriorating,
Don't you think I'd want to take steps to prevent that?
Okay.
Gotta go.
Here's Clancy's DNA.
And here's the DNA from that piece of his heart we just biopsied.
That is impossible.
- Run it again.
- We already did.
And once more after that.
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body.
Alien DNA.
Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.
That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.
Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.
First daddy was a rapist, now he's a chemist.
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia or both.
- Is your leg hurting?
- Is that question helping?
- You're leaning.
- You're sitting.
- You're evading.
- My head's hurting.
Please, someone give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA.
We could search his home for toxins, fungals, and radiation.
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with a strep, we don't conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from, we cure it.
We know he's got this inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.
Where do we cut?
Chances are it's not just in his heart.
We got lucky with the heart.
Myocytes contract, we could see that these weren't working.
I don't know how the hell we're gonna find it anywhere else.
What if we take the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?
Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
It's the same way we search for cancer.
The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells.
We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein.
We flush it throughout his system and the similar cells light up like... lightbulbs.
Okay.
Let's do that.
- You have to tell him.
- He said he wasn't in any pain.
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- We need another plan.
- Don't talk about it that way.
What way?
Plan.
Sounds like we're conspiring against him.
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No, you're not.
Then come up with a cunning plan and fast.
She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is.
What's this machine do?
It makes a lot of noise.
And it's gonna help us figure out what's wrong with you.
You think House has lost a step?
He's fine.
There, a clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur.
Explains the intermittent bleeding disorder.
'Cause I don't need to subject myself to House's torture if there's no upside.
I'm telling you, he's fine.
We missed some affected cells in his heart.
Explains the continuing hypertensive issues.
You said the last case really threw him.
And now suddenly...
I was wrong.
So you changed your mind.
Why?
His brilliant ideas on this case have all been yours.
There's the reason for him needing glasses.
Apparently it's a symptom.
Means the condition predates--
You don't change your mind without a reason.
What do you know?
House... didn't blow the last case.
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.
Cuddy and Wilson are trying to teach him some humility.
Scan is complete.
Three hot spots, but nothing in his brain.
House's original theory was right.
It is not neurological.
Is he gonna be able to walk?
His leg should be functional after some rehab.
Functional?
What does that mean?
He's be able to walk but not run?
He'll have a limp?
If everything goes well, he'll walk, he'll run.
He'll probably be even stronger than he is now.
When we close him up, we'll move over to his other leg.
Snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart.
Once the affected areas are removed, his normal tissue will set back in and do its job.
He should have no more problems with his blood pressure.
After confirming those areas are clear, we'll start the final procedure.
I'm gonna insert a needle through the pupil and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina.
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?
Yeah.
It's clear.
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.
Thank you.
You wanna go for a run?
What do you want?
I want you to run.
When did you become an enabler?
I'm enabling you to exercise.
Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab.
Muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.
I'd rather not become dependent on pain pills to get through my day.
You're just like any other patient.
Running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
You're scared the Ketamine treatment's wearing off.
That it was just a.... torturous window to the good life.
What part of poop didn't you understand?
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?
It's my leg.
We've known each other a long time.
You're not always right, House.
You've proven that lately.
- What's happening to him?
- He's seizing.
I need clonazepam.
I thought you got it all!
Yeah, yell at me.
That'll fix the kid.
Obviously we missed some foreign tissue.
There's something still in him.
The hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe.
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you were wrong, again.
We didn't miss anything.
The brain scan was completely clean.
Our tag must not have penetrated the blood brain barrier.
Don't use an IV this time, get it right into the brain.
No cells are lighting up.
His brain is clean.
It is not neurological.
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.
What if it is there, but didn't show up on the scan?
What if the tag just doesn't work in his brain?
Brain cells are structurally different.
They express a different protein.
So how do we find it?
Where are we going?
I am going to think.
Send the kid home.
What do you mean?
Make sure his blood pressure is stabilized and send him home.
- Like nothing ever happened?
- We cured his bleeding disorder and removed all the damaged cells we could find.
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.
Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.
It's more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
He had a convulsion.
Maybe epilepsy, maybe psychological.
Maybe nothing.
If the kid gets sick again, that'll give us another clue and we'll start searching again.
If he doesn't, it doesn't matter.
Send him home.
House!
You're just giving up on this kid?
You gotta know when to stop.
You don't stop.
You never stop, you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.
Except on my last case.
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.
This kid obviously has something wrong with him.
When did you develop such strong opinions about my patients?
Last week you were convinced that my patient wasn't sick.
- Now you're convinced this one is.
- This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.
Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours...
Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg.
It's where we found most of it.
Maybe we should just remove his affected eye completely.
If you have reason to believe that that might help...
I'm not gonna start lopping off body parts.
But it's interesting that you give me the green light.
I just want you to do something.
You've been overly supportive this entire week.
Well, either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden.
And it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
- I'm not pregnant.
- Then what did you do wrong?
He had Addison's.
Your last patient.
You were right.
I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip Van Winkle.
Oh, your mommy's in such trouble.
She's such a liar.
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...
How does one person... end up with two different sets of DNA?
- We've been through this.
- Our assumptions are faulty.
We've confirmed two different sets of DNA.
We re-ran the sequence.
I didn't say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty.
We assumed he's a person.
Of course.
The aliens didn't just visit him, they replaced him.
You're being silly.
What if he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?
- I'm not getting the metaphor.
- No metaphor.
Chase said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?
- Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
- Kid was right all along.
He was implanted with something.
Back when he was young.
I mean, really young.
Like 12 cells young.
In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.
But he doesn't have a twin.
Not walking around...
But in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop.
So doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth.
The problem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.
Two brothers get stuck sharing, but there's no bunk beds.
So they cuddle up to keep warm and they never untangle.
He's two people in one.
It's called chimerism.
Unfortunately, his brother's... like a bad doubles partner.
The guy just takes up space, gets in the way.
Clancy's body thinks he's gonna put away the easy winners, his brother just keeps swatting the balls into the net.
We gotta get him off the court.
So does that mean that you can find the bad cells in his brain or not?
Sure, abandon the metaphor.
Fine.
Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks.
If we induce an alien abduction...
Wait, what the hell are you talking about?
The foreign DNA has got to be in the portion of your son's brain that makes him believe that he's being abducted.
If we stimulate those neurons with an electric probe, we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating.
Your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will remain dark.
Those are the ones we cut out.
You're talking about brain surgery.
I'm talking about really cool brain surgery.
One of your sons will die.
But the taller one won't be so annoying anymore.
- So I have a twin?
- Not really.
What's on the card?
Light bulb.
Start us out at ten.
I'm not doing that.
It was all me, kid.
Sorry.
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.
- He lives inside me.
- Sort of.
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.
You're in sensory.
Getting closer.
- What do you see on this one?
- Moon and stars.
So...
I am kind of weird?
We're all kind of weird.
No!
- Clancy?
- We got something.
- What do you see?
- The light.
Here they come.
I think.
Brain waves indicate mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.
- Any dark spots?
- Area's too fuzzy.
Hallucination isn't strong enough.
Turn up the juice.
His blood pressure's already at 160 over 110.
Any higher and...
Riding the short bus is better than not breathing.
Take us to 100.
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.
Crank it up higher.
You've already exceeded the pre-set maximum.
Next step's brain damage.
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.
Clancy, can you hear me?
Clancy?
You got them.
We got 'em all.
Close him up.
Everything's gonna be normal again.
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?
What now?
She lied to me.
She cured my patient with my diagnosis, then she lied to me about it.
- That doesn't sound like her.
- You're right.
Does sound like you, though.
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?
Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.
So what was the plan?
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case that I'd re-evaluate my entire life, question the nature of truth and goodness,
- and become Cameron?
- Something like that.
More that if we told you the truth, that you'd solved a case based on absolutely no medical proof,
you'd think you were God.
And I was worried your wings would melt.
God doesn't limp.
Mom!
- I'm thirsty.
- I just gave you water.
I want juice.
It's bedtime.
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
Mom!
What do you want, Clance?
Hi, Dad.
Go to bed.
- Can I turn the TV on?
- TV is only for the daytime.
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.
Go to bed.
Dad, what if...
What if they come to get me again?
Nobody is coming to get you.
OK?
Go to bed.
Now.
Come on, Clancy.
It's time to get up.
- I guess he's already up.
- That's a first.
I-I will, uh, I'll see if he needs breakfast.
Hey, Clance, you hungry?
Hon, he's not down here.
You sure?
Clancy?
Clancy?
Where are you?
- Sweetie, are you hiding?
- Clancy?
Where is he?
You're gonna be in big trouble when I find you.
Honey, come out right now, wherever you are.
This is not funny.
Where's the sweat and the B.O.?
You've taken such pride in bathing us all in your musk.
- Showered at home.
- And yet you're earlier than usual.
Is this an intervention?
It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore.
I am, however, still hooked on phonics.
If you did your morning run and showered at home, you'd be later than usual.
Thought of you in the shower.
How's your leg?
You seem to be favoring your left side.
I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday.
- Makes all the difference in the world.
- You've taken the stairs every day.
- Did I need a restraining order?
- You slack on your rehab, the muscle will weaken.
And your leg will hurt again.
Looks like the Ketamine treatment might not stick.
Or maybe we've made him depressed because we're lying to him.
- Telling him he got that case wrong.
- We didn't hurt him.
The pain isn't...
He gets depressed, he stops exercising.
He stops exercising, the muscle atrophies.
The muscle atrophies, the pain returns.
Maybe he stopped exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.
The Ketamine could work perfectly and he would still be back on his cane popping Vicodin again.
You can't tell him.
He got lucky.
There was no medical...
He was right.
We tell him he was right, and we're feeding his addiction.
Without Vicodin, he's only got one to focus on.
- Well, he's not gonna O.D. on puzzles.
- No, it's not gonna hurt him.
But he could just as easily have killed that patient.
We have a tiny window of time here where House may be healthy enough to change.
And based on that limp, the window's closing fast.
Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy.
Had all his vaccinations.
Fractured his right ulna at age three, chicken pox at age five...
Did he ever get his feelings hurt?
I'll need to know that too.
You are 0 for 1 since you came back.
We just wanna make sure...
Rectal bleeding plus alien abduction fantasies, most likely sexual abuse.
Penetration causes the bleed, trauma causes the fantasy.
E. R. ran a rape kit, found no evidence of tearing, semen, or pubic hairs.
I think we should talk to the kid.
Why?
In case he's telling the truth?
You're a believer, aren't you?
I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy and ten million billion planets in the universe, that we're the only ones with life.
No.
But
I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our backdoors.
There is new research indicating a link between neurological problems
- and bleeding disorders.
- Perfect.
Especially if there were neurological problems.
What part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?
- It wasn't a hallucination.
- What?
- You think the kid...
- Is having nightmares.
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything other than wanting to sleep with mommy.
Which just leaves us with one symptom, the bloody tuchus.
Which can easily be explained by a G. I. problem or a bleeding disorder.
Check his coags with a PT, PTT, and bleeding time.
Prep him for endoscopies from above and below.
Gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm, okay?
Then I'm gonna time how long it takes for you to stop bleeding.
This is gonna sting a little, so you might want to look the other way.
Are those windows locked?
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.
Good. 'Cause they know I'm here.
Clancy... don't bother the doctor with this stuff.
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?
They put a chip in my neck so they can keep track of me.
I can feel it back there.
Clancy, you know there is nothing back there.
- There is.
- Let me see.
Lean forwards.
And they have this other thing.
And they put it... in between these two ribs.
Always on this side.
And then they move it around my insides.
- It hurts.
- You know what, Clancy?
I think I might have found the chip back there.
And I think I might be able to get it out.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
Okay, lean forwards.
Now hold very still, okay?
Got it.
I'm seven... not three.
All you did was pinch my neck.
Sorry.
His alien abduction story, the level of detail is...
I don't know where he gets it from.
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books.
Great.
You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.
So, it's a simple bleeding disorder.
No.
Blood tests were all normal.
And he clotted in six minutes.
So it's a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.
I didn't screw up the test.
So it's a U.F.O.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.
Either you screwed up the test or I screwed up my analysis of this case.
If you screwed up, I don't have to cry myself to sleep.
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.
How could I screw up a simple bleeding time test?
Maybe you were abducted and lost time.
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.
You're sure?
I had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.
So you're saying Chase did screw up.
Or Foreman screwed up.
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playin' the dozens.
You're at a huge cultural disadvantage here, Chase.
Take a couple minutes to think of a witty retort.
So we have contradicting bleeding time tests.
If we run labs to check his clotting fac- tors, we can confirm which one's right.
Yeah, testing.
Nice idea.
Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent.
Looks better in the paperwork too.
Hey, Foreman, your mama's so fat, when her beeper goes off, people think she's backing up.
Where's Clancy?
He's asleep.
He's...
House!
Clancy's gone missing.
Oh, no!
You take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on Tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint.
Let's pray he hasn't gone into hyperdrive.
We'll never catch him.
Clancy?
I had to go where there are no windows so I could get the chip out like you said.
God.
- I can feel it, I just can't grab it.
- Clancy, stop!
There is no chip.
We're gonna clean you up and we're gonna go back to your room.
You can't do things like this.
Your parents--
Results came back.
The lab cannot identify the metal.
Said it might not even be terrestrial.
- Really?
- No, you idiot, it's titanium.
Like from a surgical pin.
Like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago.
- Nice medical history.
- That pin was removed six months after.
So a little piece broke off during removal.
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.
Tell that to guys on the Kursk.
And how exactly did it get from his arm to the back of his neck?
Body attacks any foreign object.
Inflammatory reaction could erode it into a vein, fragment gets a free ride.
To his lungs, maybe.
Not his neck.
Yeah, an alien chip makes more sense.
The real mystery is that you didn't actually screw up.
You okay?
Fine.
Tripped.
Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck and apparently didn't bleed to death.
- Now, that's weird.
- He clotted on his own?
Sure did.
So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there is not again.
- Which is impossible.
- Or Foreman screwed up.
Two out of three tests agree with my findings.
Well, lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.
So you're just gonna keep cutting him?
Until what?
This test is different.
We draw some blood and see if any clotting factors are low or missing.
But why haven't the other tests--
We've got three results that haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.
Or two of them.
Is it possible the problem isn't his blood?
It's just psychological.
- I mean, he almost killed himself.
- He wasn't trying to hurt himself.
No... he was just looking for an alien tracking device.
I have time for one more.
Don't blame you for spending extra time down here.
Heard the artist formerly known as gimp is back upstairs.
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.
She's busy.
I'll take it.
Oh, my God.
You're...
How...
You're okay.
Have we met?
I was one of your doctors.
You were in a vegetative state when you left here last week.
Addison's disease.
All I needed was cortisol and my brain turned on like a switch.
- This is amazing.
- Surprised
- you didn't know.
- How would I know?
Not quite my old self yet.
- Baby steps, the doctors tell me.
- With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?
- How would I...
- I wanna have sex with my wife.
And I was hoping that maybe...
- You could...
- Viagra?
- You're here for Viagra?
- A bucketful would be nice.
Dr. Cuddy.
- It's completely unethical.
- He was reckless with a patient.
- He was right.
- But he didn't know that.
He needs at least some glimmer of humility.
Why does he need that?
Because other people have that?
Why does he need to be like other people?
- He needs to be less reckless.
- Well, you did it.
He's dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions.
He's in pain.
- How much pain?
- Why?
You know this is affecting him, don't you?
Telling him that he got his last case right won't do anything to help him.
- It'll make him less depressed.
- Which might not help his leg.
But you don't know.
Just let me run a PET scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.
If it is, the Ketamine isn't working any- more and he's headed for a huge crash.
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault and I will tell him the truth.
Too tight?
- My parents think I'm crazy.
- No, they don't.
They're just worried about you, that's all.
I'm not weird.
It's just that weird things keep happening to me.
Slight pinch.
If you make me better, do you think the aliens will leave me alone?
I don't think they're gonna be bothering you for much longer.
- You lying again?
- No.
We figure this out, everything's gonna be okay.
You still with us?
Pulmonary edema, stage two hypertensive crisis.
- What is happening?
- Wait outside.
Get him oxygen.
Start him on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.
Get them outside!
He's in ICU.
Systolic is hovering around 170.
I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.
The trade-off being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke,
- M. I., and blindness.
- I'm open to suggestions.
Solve the case.
- Kidneys could explain...
- Kidneys are clean.
Tell me he's a mutant/human hybrid.
It is a bleeding disorder.
Clancy tested positive for Von Willebrand's.
I didn't screw up.
How could he clot on his own two out of three times?
- Maybe he cheated.
- Right.
Kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.
I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking.
I meant he's clotting right now and he's in hypertensive crisis.
Maybe the two are related.
What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?
Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors.
Someone low on Von Willebrands could theoretically clot.
And the first time Clancy clotted, he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction.
He could have easily been hypertensive.
I know I get worked up when I cut micro- chip tracking implants out of my neck.
- Sounds like a cheat to me.
- Yeah, we get it.
Okay, what's the differential for seven-year-old boys suffering multiple hypertensive crises?
We think the problem is in your son's heart.
We need to do a procedure called a transesophegeal echo.
Okay, and that will fix his heart?
That will tell us where the problem is.
Hopefully.
Then we can fix him.
Listen... this isn't really part of my job, but... he's worried that you think he's crazy.
Well, isn't he?
There are still plenty of other explanations for what's going on.
It's important he knows you believe in him.
Even if you don't.
It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.
Why don't I have a hi-def in my office?
I'm a department head.
- There are no structural defects.
- Valves are intact.
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Foreman, you gotta steal this thing for me.
Let me ring up one of the homies.
The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears.
The problem's got to be somewhere else.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
You're wrong, House.
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?
- There.
- Where?
Right there.
Left side.
No movement.
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.
How do you see something not move if nothing's moving?
I need a laser pointer.
- We don't have a laser pointer.
- Well, why not?
Who's gonna take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer?
Right... here.
A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest.
So you found an arrhythmia.
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhythmia.
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.
Go get me those myocytes.
I want to talk to them in my office.
How's the kid doing?
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.
Most of it anyway.
Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click "Yes, I am 18"?
Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.
What's going on with the leg?
First tell me what's going on with the boobs.
- If you're feeling pain...
- They're firmer.
It's called an underwire.
- I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
- I think it's hormones.
As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus--
Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
Then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.
After you work out, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the Ketamine failed.
Guess I should be saying mazel tov.
- Who gets to pass out the cigars?
- I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.
Boy or girl?
You got a name picked out?
- I'm not pregnant.
- My leg doesn't hurt.
- You're in denial.
- No, I'm not!
Oh, you got me.
If I thought that my leg was deteriorating,
Don't you think I'd want to take steps to prevent that?
Okay.
Gotta go.
Here's Clancy's DNA.
And here's the DNA from that piece of his heart we just biopsied.
That is impossible.
- Run it again.
- We already did.
And once more after that.
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body.
Alien DNA.
Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.
That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.
Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.
First daddy was a rapist, now he's a chemist.
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia or both.
- Is your leg hurting?
- Is that question helping?
- You're leaning.
- You're sitting.
- You're evading.
- My head's hurting.
Please, someone give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA.
We could search his home for toxins, fungals, and radiation.
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with a strep, we don't conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from, we cure it.
We know he's got this inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.
Where do we cut?
Chances are it's not just in his heart.
We got lucky with the heart.
Myocytes contract, we could see that these weren't working.
I don't know how the hell we're gonna find it anywhere else.
What if we take the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?
Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
It's the same way we search for cancer.
The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells.
We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein.
We flush it throughout his system and the similar cells light up like... lightbulbs.
Okay.
Let's do that.
- You have to tell him.
- He said he wasn't in any pain.
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- We need another plan.
- Don't talk about it that way.
What way?
Plan.
Sounds like we're conspiring against him.
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No, you're not.
Then come up with a cunning plan and fast.
She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is.
What's this machine do?
It makes a lot of noise.
And it's gonna help us figure out what's wrong with you.
You think House has lost a step?
He's fine.
There, a clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur.
Explains the intermittent bleeding disorder.
'Cause I don't need to subject myself to House's torture if there's no upside.
I'm telling you, he's fine.
We missed some affected cells in his heart.
Explains the continuing hypertensive issues.
You said the last case really threw him.
And now suddenly...
I was wrong.
So you changed your mind.
Why?
His brilliant ideas on this case have all been yours.
There's the reason for him needing glasses.
Apparently it's a symptom.
Means the condition predates--
You don't change your mind without a reason.
What do you know?
House... didn't blow the last case.
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.
Cuddy and Wilson are trying to teach him some humility.
Scan is complete.
Three hot spots, but nothing in his brain.
House's original theory was right.
It is not neurological.
Is he gonna be able to walk?
His leg should be functional after some rehab.
Functional?
What does that mean?
He's be able to walk but not run?
He'll have a limp?
If everything goes well, he'll walk, he'll run.
He'll probably be even stronger than he is now.
When we close him up, we'll move over to his other leg.
Snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart.
Once the affected areas are removed, his normal tissue will set back in and do its job.
He should have no more problems with his blood pressure.
After confirming those areas are clear, we'll start the final procedure.
I'm gonna insert a needle through the pupil and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina.
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?
Yeah.
It's clear.
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.
Thank you.
You wanna go for a run?
What do you want?
I want you to run.
When did you become an enabler?
I'm enabling you to exercise.
Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab.
Muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.
I'd rather not become dependent on pain pills to get through my day.
You're just like any other patient.
Running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
You're scared the Ketamine treatment's wearing off.
That it was just a.... torturous window to the good life.
What part of poop didn't you understand?
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?
It's my leg.
We've known each other a long time.
You're not always right, House.
You've proven that lately.
- What's happening to him?
- He's seizing.
I need clonazepam.
I thought you got it all!
Yeah, yell at me.
That'll fix the kid.
Obviously we missed some foreign tissue.
There's something still in him.
The hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe.
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you were wrong, again.
We didn't miss anything.
The brain scan was completely clean.
Our tag must not have penetrated the blood brain barrier.
Don't use an IV this time, get it right into the brain.
No cells are lighting up.
His brain is clean.
It is not neurological.
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.
What if it is there, but didn't show up on the scan?
What if the tag just doesn't work in his brain?
Brain cells are structurally different.
They express a different protein.
So how do we find it?
Where are we going?
I am going to think.
Send the kid home.
What do you mean?
Make sure his blood pressure is stabilized and send him home.
- Like nothing ever happened?
- We cured his bleeding disorder and removed all the damaged cells we could find.
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.
Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.
It's more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
He had a convulsion.
Maybe epilepsy, maybe psychological.
Maybe nothing.
If the kid gets sick again, that'll give us another clue and we'll start searching again.
If he doesn't, it doesn't matter.
Send him home.
House!
You're just giving up on this kid?
You gotta know when to stop.
You don't stop.
You never stop, you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.
Except on my last case.
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.
This kid obviously has something wrong with him.
When did you develop such strong opinions about my patients?
Last week you were convinced that my patient wasn't sick.
- Now you're convinced this one is.
- This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.
Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours...
Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg.
It's where we found most of it.
Maybe we should just remove his affected eye completely.
If you have reason to believe that that might help...
I'm not gonna start lopping off body parts.
But it's interesting that you give me the green light.
I just want you to do something.
You've been overly supportive this entire week.
Well, either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden.
And it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
- I'm not pregnant.
- Then what did you do wrong?
He had Addison's.
Your last patient.
You were right.
I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip Van Winkle.
Oh, your mommy's in such trouble.
She's such a liar.
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...
How does one person... end up with two different sets of DNA?
- We've been through this.
- Our assumptions are faulty.
We've confirmed two different sets of DNA.
We re-ran the sequence.
I didn't say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty.
We assumed he's a person.
Of course.
The aliens didn't just visit him, they replaced him.
You're being silly.
What if he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?
- I'm not getting the metaphor.
- No metaphor.
Chase said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?
- Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
- Kid was right all along.
He was implanted with something.
Back when he was young.
I mean, really young.
Like 12 cells young.
In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.
But he doesn't have a twin.
Not walking around...
But in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop.
So doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth.
The problem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.
Two brothers get stuck sharing, but there's no bunk beds.
So they cuddle up to keep warm and they never untangle.
He's two people in one.
It's called chimerism.
Unfortunately, his brother's... like a bad doubles partner.
The guy just takes up space, gets in the way.
Clancy's body thinks he's gonna put away the easy winners, his brother just keeps swatting the balls into the net.
We gotta get him off the court.
So does that mean that you can find the bad cells in his brain or not?
Sure, abandon the metaphor.
Fine.
Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks.
If we induce an alien abduction...
Wait, what the hell are you talking about?
The foreign DNA has got to be in the portion of your son's brain that makes him believe that he's being abducted.
If we stimulate those neurons with an electric probe, we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating.
Your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will remain dark.
Those are the ones we cut out.
You're talking about brain surgery.
I'm talking about really cool brain surgery.
One of your sons will die.
But the taller one won't be so annoying anymore.
- So I have a twin?
- Not really.
What's on the card?
Light bulb.
Start us out at ten.
I'm not doing that.
It was all me, kid.
Sorry.
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.
- He lives inside me.
- Sort of.
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.
You're in sensory.
Getting closer.
- What do you see on this one?
- Moon and stars.
So...
I am kind of weird?
We're all kind of weird.
No!
- Clancy?
- We got something.
- What do you see?
- The light.
Here they come.
I think.
Brain waves indicate mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.
- Any dark spots?
- Area's too fuzzy.
Hallucination isn't strong enough.
Turn up the juice.
His blood pressure's already at 160 over 110.
Any higher and...
Riding the short bus is better than not breathing.
Take us to 100.
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.
Crank it up higher.
You've already exceeded the pre-set maximum.
Next step's brain damage.
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.
Clancy, can you hear me?
Clancy?
You got them.
We got 'em all.
Close him up.
Everything's gonna be normal again.
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?
What now?
She lied to me.
She cured my patient with my diagnosis, then she lied to me about it.
- That doesn't sound like her.
- You're right.
Does sound like you, though.
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?
Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.
So what was the plan?
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case that I'd re-evaluate my entire life, question the nature of truth and goodness,
- and become Cameron?
- Something like that.
More that if we told you the truth, that you'd solved a case based on absolutely no medical proof,
you'd think you were God.
And I was worried your wings would melt.
God doesn't limp.
CLANCY:
Mom!
I'm thirsty.
I just gave you water.
I want juice.
It's bedtime.
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
Mom!
(DOOR OPENS)
What do you want, Glance?
Oh.
Hi, Dad.
(SIGHS) Go to bed.
Can I turn the TV on?
TV's only for the daytime.
That was the deal.
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.
Go to bed.
Dad, what if...
What if they come to get me again?
Nobody is coming to get you, okay?
Go to bed now.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(STATIC CRACKLING)
(GASPS)
(SCREAMING)
Come on, Clancy.
It's time to get up.
WOMAN ON TV:
If you plan to be out at the shore today, you are in for a treat.
We're looking at mostly sunny skies up and down the Jersey coast...
I guess he's already up.
That's a first.
Well, I'll see if he needs breakfast.
TODD:
Hey, Glance, you hungry?
Hon, he's not down here.
You sure?
Clancy?
Clancy?
Clancy?
Where are you?
- Sweetie, are you hiding?
- Clancy?
Where is he?
Clancy!
Clancy!
TODD:
You're gonna be in big trouble when I find you.
Honey, come out right now, wherever you are.
This is not funny.
TODD:
Glance?
STEPHANIE:
Clancy?
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
(EXCLAIMS)
Where's the sweat and the BO?
You've taken such pride in bathing us all in your musk.
I showered at home.
And yet you're earlier than usual.
Is this an intervention?
It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore.
I am, however, still hooked on phonics.
If you did your morning run and showered at home, you'd be later than usual.
Thought of you in the shower.
How's your leg?
You seem to be favoring your left side.
I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday, makes all the difference in the world.
You've taken the stairs every day.
Do I need a restraining order?
You slack on your rehab, the muscle will weaken, and your leg will hurt again.
Looks like the ketamine treatment might not stick.
Or maybe we've made him depressed because we're lying to him, telling him he got that case wrong.
We didn't hurt him.
The pain isn't...
He gets depressed, he stops exercising.
He stops exercising, the muscle atrophies.
The muscle atrophies, the pain returns.
Maybe he stopped exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.
The ketamine could work perfectly, and he would still be back on his cane, popping Vicodin again.
You can't tell him.
He got lucky.
There was no medical...
He was right.
We tell him he was right, and we're feeding his addiction.
Without Vicodin, he's only got one to focus on.
Well, he's not gonna OD on puzzles.
No, it's not gonna hurt him, but he could just as easily have killed that patient.
We have a tiny window of time here where House may be healthy enough to change, and based on that limp, the window's closing fast.
Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy, had all his vaccinations, fractured his right ulna at age three, chicken pox at age five...
He ever get his feelings hurt?
I'll need to know that, too.
You are "0" for one since you came back.
We just wanna make sure that...
Rectal bleeding plus alien-abduction fantasies.
Most likely sexual abuse.
Penetration causes the bleed.
Trauma causes the fantasy.
ER ran a rape kit, found no evidence of tearing, semen or pubic hairs.
I think we should talk to the kid.
Why?
In case he's telling the truth?
You're a believer, aren't you?
Well, I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy and 10 million billion planets in the universe, that we're the only ones with life.
No, but I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our back doors.
There is new research indicating a link between neurological problems and bleeding disorders.
Perfect, especially if there were neurological problems.
What part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?
It wasn't a hallucination.
What?
You think the kid...
He's having nightmares.
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything other than wanting to sleep with Mommy, which just leaves us with one symptom, the bloody tuchus, which can easily explained by a GI problem or bleeding disorder.
Check his coags with a PT, PTT and bleeding time, and prep him for endoscopies from above and below.
I'm gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm, okay?
Then I'm gonna time how long it takes for you to stop bleeding.
Now, this is gonna sting a little, so you might wanna look the other way.
Are those windows locked?
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.
Good, 'cause they know I'm here.
Clancy, don't bother the doctor with this stuff.
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?
They put a chip in my neck so they can keep track of me.
I can feel it back there.
Clancy, you know there is nothing back there.
There is.
Let me see.
Lean forwards.
And they have this other thing, and they put it in between these two ribs, always on this side, and then they move it around my insides.
It hurts.
You know what, Clancy?
I think I might have found the chip back there, and I think I might be able to get it out.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
Okay, lean forwards.
Now hold very still, okay?
Got it.
(EXHALES)
I'm seven, not three.
All you did was pinch my neck.
Sorry.
His alien-abduction story, the level of detail is...
Well, I don't know where he gets it from.
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi.
He doesn't read comic books...
Great.
You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.
So it's a simple bleeding disorder.
No, blood tests are all normal, and he clotted in six minutes.
So it's a simple bleeding disorder, and you screwed up the test.
I didn't screw up the test.
So it's a UFO.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.
Either you screwed up the test, or I screwed up my analysis of this case.
If you screwed up, I don't have to cry myself to sleep.
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.
How could I screw up a simple bleeding-time test?
Maybe you were abducted, lost time.
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.
Sure?
I had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.
So you're saying Chase did screw up.
Or Foreman screwed up.
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playing the dozens.
You're at a huge cultural disadvantage here, Chase.
Take a couple of minutes to think of a witty retort.
So we have contradicting bleeding-time tests.
If we run labs to check his clotting factors, we can confirm which one's right.
Yeah, testing.
Nice idea.
Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent.
Looks better in the paperwork, too.
Hey, Foreman, your mama's so fat, when her beeper goes off, people think she's backing up.
Where's Clancy?
He's asleep.
He's...
House, Clancy's gone missing.
Oh, no!
You take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on Tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint.
Let's pray he hasn't gone into hyperdrive.
We'll never catch him.
(GRUNTING)
Clancy?
I had to go where there are no windows so I could get the chip out.
God.
I can feel it.
I just can't grab it.
Clancy, stop.
There is no chip.
We're gonna clean you up, and we're gonna go back to your room.
You can't do things like this.
Your parents...
(SIGHS)
Results came back.
The lab cannot identify the metal.
Said it might not even be terrestrial.
Really?
No, you idiot, it's titanium, like from a surgical pin, like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago.
Nice medical history.
That pin was removed six months...
So a little piece broke off during removal.
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.
Tell that to the guys on the Kursk.
And how exactly did it get from his arm to the back of his neck?
Body attacks any foreign object.
Inflammatory reaction could erode it into a vein.
Fragment gets a free ride.
To his lungs maybe, not his neck.
Yeah, an alien chip makes more sense.
The real mystery is that you didn't actually screw up.
You Okay?
Fine.
Tripped.
Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck.
Apparently didn't bleed to death.
Now that's weird.
He clotted on his own?
Sure did.
So first there was no bleeding disorder.
Then there was.
Now there's not again.
Which is impossible.
Or Foreman screwed up.
Two out of three tests agree with my findings.
Lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.
So you're just gonna keep cutting him?
Until what?
This test is different.
We'll draw some blood, and see if any clotting factors are low or missing.
- But why haven't the other tests...
- We've got three results.
They haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.
Or two of them.
Is it possible the problem isn't his blood?
It's just psychological?
I mean, he almost killed himself.
He wasn't trying to hurt himself.
No, he was just looking for an alien tracking device.
I have time for one more.
Can't blame you for spending extra time down here.
I heard the Artist Formerly Known as Gimp is back upstairs.
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.
She's busy.
I'll take it.
Oh, my God!
You're...
You're okay!
Have we met?
I was one of your doctors.
You were in a vegetative state when you left here last week.
Addison's disease.
All I needed was cortisol, and my brain turned on like a switch.
This is amazing!
Surprised you didn't know.
How would I know?
Not quite my old self yet.
Baby steps, the doctors tell me.
Now...
With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?
- How would I...
- I wanna have sex with my wife, and I was hoping that maybe you could...
Viagra?
You're here for Viagra?
A bucketful would be nice.
Dr. Cuddy.
Hi.
It's completely unethical.
He was reckless with a patient.
- He was right.
- But he didn't know that.
He needs at least some glimmer of humility.
Why does he need that?
Because other people have that?
Why does he need to be like other people?
He needs to be less reckless.
Well, you did it.
He's dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions.
He's in pain.
- How much pain?
- Why?
You know this is affecting him, don't you?
Telling him that he got his last case right won't do anything to help him.
- It'll make him less depressed.
- Which might not help his leg.
But you don't know.
Just let me run a PET scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.
If it is, the ketamine isn't working anymore, and he's headed for a huge crash.
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault, and I will tell him the truth.
Too tight?
My parents think I'm crazy.
No, they don't.
They're just worried about you.
That's all.
I'm not weird.
It's just that weird things keep happening to me.
Slight pinch.
If you make me better, do you think the aliens will leave me alone?
I don't think they're gonna be bothering you for much longer.
Are you lying again?
No.
We figure this out, everything's gonna be okay.
(PANTING)
Still with us?
(GASPING)
NURSE:
Let's go.
CHASE:
Pulmonary edema, stage-two hypertensive crisis.
What is happening?
Wait outside.
Get him oxygen, and start him on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.
Get them outside!
He's in ICU, systolic is hovering around 170.
I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.
Trade-off being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke,
Ml and blindness.
I'm open to suggestions.
Solve the case.
Kidneys could explain...
Kidneys are clean.
Tell me he's a mutant-human hybrid.
It is a bleeding disorder.
Clancy tested positive for Von Willebrand's.
I didn't screw up.
How could he clot on his own two out of three times?
Maybe he cheated.
CHASE:
Right.
Kids always cheat on their bleeding-time tests.
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.
I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what The Rock was cooking.
I meant, he's clotting right now, and he's in hypertensive crisis.
Maybe the two are related.
What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?
Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors.
Even someone low on Von Willebrand's could theoretically clot.
And the first time Clancy clotted, he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction.
He could've easily been hypertensive.
I get worked up when I cut microchip tracking implants out of my neck.
Sounds like a cheat to me.
Yeah, we get it.
Okay, what's the differential for a seven-year-old boy suffering multiple hypertensive crises?
We think the problem is in your son's heart.
We need to do a procedure called a transesophageal echo.
Okay, and that will fix his heart?
That will tell us where the problem is, hopefully.
Then we can fix him.
Listen, this isn't really part of my job, but he's worried that you think he's crazy.
Well, isn't he?
There are still plenty of other explanations for what's going on.
It's important he knows you believe in him, even if you don't.
FOREMAN:
It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.
Why don't I have a high-def in my office?
I'm a department head.
- There are no structural defects.
- Valves are intact.
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Foreman, you gotta steal this thing for me.
Let me ring up one of the homies.
The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears.
The problem's gotta be somewhere else.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
(HEARTBEAT THUMPING)
You're wrong, House.
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?
- There.
- Where?
Right there.
Left side, no movement.
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.
How do you see something not move if nothing's moving?
I need a laser pointer.
- We don't have a laser pointer.
- Well, why not?
Who's gonna take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer?
Right here.
A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest.
So you've found an arrhythmia?
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhythmia.
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.
Go get me those myocytes.
I wanna talk to them in my office.
How's the kid doing?
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.
Most of it, anyway.
Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click, "Yes, I am 18?"
Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.
What's going on with the leg?
First, tell me what's going on with the boobs.
- If you're feeling pain...
- They're firmer.
It's called an underwire.
I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
I think it's hormones.
As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus...
Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
...then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.
After you workout, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.
Guess I should be saying,"Mazel tov." Who gets to pass out the cigars?
I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.
- Boy or girl?
You got a name?
- I'm not pregnant.
- My leg doesn't hurt.
- You're in denial.
No, I'm not!
Oh, you got me.
(SIGHS)
If I thought that my leg was deteriorating, don't you think I'd want to take steps to prevent that?
(SIGHS)
Okay-
(PAGER BEEPING)
Gotta go.
(GROANS)
(EXCLAIMS)
(SIGHS)
Here's Clancy's DNA.
And here's the DNA from that piece of his heart we just biopsied.
That is impossible.
Run it again.
We already did and once more after that.
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body.
Alien DNA.
Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.
That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.
Nitrous acid or ethidium-bromide exposure.
First, Daddy was a rapist.
Now he's a chemist.
CHASE:
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia or both.
- Is your leg hurting?
- Is that question helping?
- You're leaning.
- You're sitting.
- You're evading.
- My head's hurting.
Please, someone, give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA.
We could search his home for toxins, fungals and radiation.
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with strep, we don't conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from.
We cure it.
We know he's got the stuff inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.
Where do we cut?
Chances are, it's not just in his heart.
Well, we got lucky with the heart.
Myocytes contract.
We could see that these weren't working.
I don't know how the hell we're gonna find it anywhere else.
What if we take the heart cells with the bad DNA, and we tag them?
Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
It's the same way we search for cancer.
The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells.
We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein, we flush it throughout his system, and the similar cells light up like light bulbs.
Okay, let's do that.
You have to tell him.
He said he wasn't in any pain.
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
We need another plan.
Don't talk about it that way.
What Way?
"Plan."
It sounds like we're conspiring against him.
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No, you're not.
Then come up with a cunning plan and fast.
She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is.
What's this machine do?
Makes a lot of noise, and it's gonna help us figure out what's wrong with you.
You think House has lost a step?
He's fine.
There.
Clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur.
Explains the intermittent-bleeding disorder.
'Cause I don't need to subject myself to House's torture if there's no upside.
I'm telling you, he's fine.
We missed some affected cells in his heart.
Explains the continuing hypertensive issues.
You said the last case really threw him, and now suddenly...
I was wrong.
So you changed your mind.
Why?
His brilliant ideas on this case have all been yours.
There's the reason for him needing glasses.
Apparently, it's a symptom.
It means the condition predates...
You don't change your mind without a reason.
Now, what do you know?
House didn't blow the last case.
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.
Cuddy and Wilson are trying to teach him some humility.
Scan is complete.
Three hot spots, but nothing in his brain.
House's original theory was right.
It is not neurological.
TODD:
Is he going to be able to walk?
CHASE:
His leg should be functional after some rehab.
STEPHANIE: "Functional"?
What does that mean?
He'll be able to walk, but not run?
He'll have a limp?
If everything goes well, he'll walk.
He'll run.
He'll probably be even stronger than he is now.
When we close him up, we'll move over to his other leg, snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart.
Once the affected areas are removed, is normal tissue ill step back in, do its job.
He should have no more problems with his blood pressure.
After confirming those areas are clear, we'll start the final procedure.
We're gonna insert a needle through the pupil and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina.
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?
Yeah, it's clear.
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.
Thank you.
Do you wanna go for a run?
What do you want?
I want you to run.
When did you become an enabler?
I'm enabling you to exercise.
Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab, muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.
I'd rather not become dependent on pain pills to get through my day.
You're just like any other patient, running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
You're scared the ketamine treatment's wearing off, that it was just a torturous window to the good life.
What part of "poop" didn't you understand?
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?
It's my leg.
We've known each other a long time.
You're not always right, House.
You've proven that lately.
STEPHANIE:
What's happening to him?
- He's seizing.
I need clonazepam.
- I thought you got it all.
Yeah, yell at me.
That'll fix your kid.
Obviously, we missed some foreign tissue.
There's something still in him.
The hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe.
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you're wrong again.
We didn't miss anything.
Brain scan was completely clean.
Our tag must not have penetrated the blood-brain barrier.
Don't use an IV this time.
Get it right into the brain.
No cells are lighting up.
His brain is clean.
It is not neurological.
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.
What if it is there, but didn't show up on the scan?
What if the tag just doesn't work in his brain?
Brain cells are structurally different, express a different protein.
So how do we find it?
Where are we going?
I am going to think.
Send the kid home.
What do you mean?
Make sure his blood pressure's stabilized, and send him home.
What, like nothing ever happened?
We cured his bleeding disorder, removed all the damaged cells we could find.
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.
Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.
It's more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
He had a convulsion.
May be epilepsy.
May be psychological.
May be nothing.
If the kid gets sick again, it'll give us another clue.
We can start searching again.
If he doesn't, doesn't matter.
Send him home.
(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE STARTS)
House.
You're just giving up on this kid?
You gotta know when to stop.
You don't stop.
You never stop.
You just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.
Except on my last case.
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.
This kid obviously has something wrong with him.
When did you develop such strong opinions about my patients?
Last week, you were convinced my patient wasn't sick.
Now you're convinced this one is.
This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.
Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours...
Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg.
That's where we found most of it.
Maybe we should just remove his affected eye completely.
If you have reason to believe that that might help...
I'm not gonna start lopping off body parts, but it's interesting that you give me the green light.
I just want you to do something.
You've been overly supportive this entire week.
Either you're hormonal, or you're guilt-ridden, and it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
- I'm not pregnant.
- Then what did you do wrong?
He had Addison's.
Your last patient.
You were right.
I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.
(SCOFF)
Oh, your mommy is in such trouble.
She's such a liar.
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...
How does one person end up with two different sets of DNA?
We've been through this.
Our assumptions are faulty.
We've confirmed two different sets of DNA.
We re-ran the sequence.
I didn't say the lab work was faulty.
I said our assumptions were faulty.
We assumed he's a person.
Of course.
The aliens didn't just visit him.
They replaced him.
You're being silly.
What if he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?
- I'm not getting the metaphor.
- No metaphor.
Chase, you said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?
Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
Kid was right all along.
He was implanted with something, back when he was young.
I mean really young, like 12-cells young.
In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.
But he doesn't have a twin.
Not walking around.
But in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop, so doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth.
Problem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.
Two brothers get stuck sharing.
There's no bunk beds, so they cuddle up to keep warm, and they never untangle.
He's two people in one.
It's called chimerism.
Unfortunately, his brother's like a bad doubles partner.
The guy just takes up space, gets in the way.
Clancy's body thinks that he's gonna put away the easy winners.
His brother just keeps swatting balls into the net.
We gotta get him off the court.
So does that mean that you can find the bad cells in his brain or not?
Sure, abandon the metaphor.
Fine.
Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks.
If we induce an alien abduction...
Wait.
What the hell are you talking about?
The foreign DNA has got to be in a portion of your son's brain that makes him believe that he's being abducted.
If we stimulate those neurons with an electric probe, we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating.
Your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will stay dark.
Those are the ones we cut out.
You're talking about brain surgery.
I'm talking about really cool brain surgery.
One of your sons will die, but the taller one won't be so annoying anymore.
So I have a twin?
Not really.
What's on the card?
A light bulb.
Start us out at 10.
I'm not doing that.
That was all me, kid.
Sorry.
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.
He lives inside me?
Sort of.
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.
You're in sensory.
You're getting closer.
What do you see on this one?
Moon and stars.
So I am kind of weird?
We're all kind of weird.
No!
- Clancy?
- We got something.
- What do you see?
- The light.
Here they come, I think.
Brain waves indicate a mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.
- Any dark spots?
- Area's too fuzzy.
Hallucination isn't strong enough.
Turn up the juice.
His blood pressure's already 160 over 110.
Any higher...
Riding the short bus is better than not breathing.
Take us to 100.
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.
- Crank it up higher.
- You've already exceeded the preset maximum.
Next step's brain damage.
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.
(GASPING)
Clancy?
Can you hear me?
Clancy?
You got them.
Yep.
We got them all.
Close him up.
Everything's gonna be normal again.
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?
What now?
She lied to me.
She cured my patient with my diagnosis, then lied to me about it.
That doesn't sound like her.
You're right.
Does sound like you, though.
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?
Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.
So what was the plan?
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case that I'd reevaluate my entire life, question the nature of truth and goodness and become Cameron?
Something like that.
More that if we told you the truth, that you solved a case based on absolutely no medical proof, you'd think you were God.
And I was worried your wings would melt.
God doesn't limp.
(GRAVITY PLAYING)
CLANCY:
Mom!
I'm thirsty.
I just gave you water.
I want juice.
It's bedtime.
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
Mom!
(DOOR OPENS)
What do you want, Clance?
Oh.
Hi, Dad.
(SIGHS) Go to bed.
Can I turn the TV on?
TV's only for the daytime.
That was the deal.
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.
Go to bed.
Dad, what if...
What if they come to get me again?
Nobody is coming to get you, okay?
Go to bed now.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(STATIC CRACKLING)
(GASPS)
(SCREAMING)
Come on, Clancy.
It's time to get up.
WOMAN ON TV.:
If you plan to be out at the shore today, you are in for a treat.
We're looking at mostly sunny skies up and down the Jersey coast...
I guess he's already up.
That's a first.
Well, I'll see if he needs breakfast.
TODD:
Hey, Clance, you hungry?
Hon, he's not down here.
You sure?
Clancy?
Clancy?
Clancy?
Where are you?
Sweetie, are you hiding?
Clancy?
Where is he?
Clancy!
Clancy!
TODD:
You're gonna be in big trouble when I find you.
Honey, come out right now, wherever you are.
This is not funny.
TODD:
Clance?
STEPHANIE:
Clancy?
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
(EXCLAIMS)
Where's the sweat and the BO?
You've taken such pride in bathing us all in your musk.
I showered at home.
And yet you're earlier than usual.
Is this an intervention?
It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore.
I am, however, still hooked on phonics.
If you did your morning run and showered at home, you'd be later than usual.
Thought of you in the shower.
How's your leg?
You seem to be favoring your left side.
I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday, makes all the difference in the world.
You've taken the stairs every day.
Do I need a restraining order?
You slack on your rehab, the muscle will weaken, and your leg will hurt again.
Looks like the ketamine treatment might not stick.
Or maybe we've made him depressed because we're lying to him, telling him he got that case wrong.
We didn't hurt him.
The pain isn't...
He gets depressed, he stops exercising.
He stops exercising, the muscle atrophies.
The muscle atrophies, the pain returns.
Maybe he stopped exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.
The ketamine could work perfectly, and he would still be back on his cane, popping Vicodin again.
You can't tell him.
He got lucky.
There was no medical...
He was right.
We tell him he was right, and we're feeding his addiction.
Without Vicodin, he's only got one to focus on.
Well, he's not gonna OD on puzzles.
No, it's not gonna hurt him, but he could just as easily have killed that patient.
We have a tiny window of time here where House may be healthy enough to change, and based on that limp, the window's closing fast.
Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy, had all his vaccinations, fractured his right ulna at age three, chicken pox at age five...
He ever get his feelings hurt?
I'll need to know that, too.
You are "0" for one since you came back.
We just wanna make sure that...
Rectal bleeding plus alien-abduction fantasies.
Most likely sexual abuse.
Penetration causes the bleed.
Trauma causes the fantasy.
ER ran a rape kit, found no evidence of tearing, semen or pubic hairs.
I think we should talk to the kid.
Why?
In case he's telling the truth?
You're a believer, aren't you?
Well, I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy and 10 million billion planets in the universe, that we're the only ones with life.
No, but I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our back doors.
There is new research indicating a link between neurological problems and bleeding disorders.
Perfect, especially if there were neurological problems.
What part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?
It wasn't a hallucination.
What?
You think the kid...
He's having nightmares.
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything other than wanting to sleep with Mommy, which just leaves us with one symptom, the bloody tuchus, which can easily explained by a GI problem or bleeding disorder.
Check his coags with a PT, PTT and bleeding time, and prep him for endoscopies from above and below.
I'm gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm, okay?
Then I'm gonna time how long it takes for you to stop bleeding.
Now, this is gonna sting a little, so you might wanna look the other way.
Are those windows locked?
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.
Good, 'cause they know I'm here.
Clancy, don't bother the doctor with this stuff.
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?
They put a chip in my neck so they can keep track of me.
I can feel it back there.
Clancy, you know there is nothing back there.
There is.
Let me see.
Lean forwards.
And they have this other thing, and they put it in between these two ribs, always on this side, and then they move it around my insides.
It hurts.
You know what, Clancy?
I think I might have found the chip back there,
- and I think I might be able to get it out.
- Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, lean forwards.
Now hold very still, okay?
Got it.
(EXHALES)
I'm seven, not three.
All you did was pinch my neck.
Sorry.
His alien-abduction story, the level of detail is...
Well, I don't know where he gets it from.
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi.
He doesn't read comic books...
Great.
You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.
So it's a simple bleeding disorder.
No, blood tests are all normal, and he clotted in six minutes.
So it's a simple bleeding disorder, and you screwed up the test.
I didn't screw up the test.
So it's a UFO.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.
Either you screwed up the test, or I screwed up my analysis of this case.
If you screwed up, I don't have to cry myself to sleep.
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.
How could I screw up a simple bleeding-time test?
Maybe you were abducted, lost time.
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.
Sure?
I had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.
So you're saying Chase did screw up.
Or Foreman screwed up.
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playing the dozens.
You're at a huge cultural disadvantage here, Chase.
Take a couple of minutes to think of a witty retort.
So we have contradicting bleeding-time tests.
If we run labs to check his clotting factors, we can confirm which one's right.
Yeah, testing.
Nice idea.
Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent.
Looks better in the paperwork, too.
Hey, Foreman, your mama's so fat, when her beeper goes off, people think she's backing up.
Where's Clancy?
He's asleep.
He's...
House, Clancy's gone missing.
Oh, no!
You take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on Tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint.
Let's pray he hasn't gone into hyperdrive.
We'll never catch him.
(GRUNTING)
Clancy?
I had to go where there are no windows so I could get the chip out like you said.
God.
I can feel it.
I just can't grab it.
Clancy, stop.
There is no chip.
We're gonna clean you up, and we're gonna go back to your room.
You can't do things like this.
Your parents...
(SIGHS)
Results came back.
The lab cannot identify the metal.
Said it might not even be terrestrial.
Really?
No, you idiot, it's titanium, like from a surgical pin, like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago.
Nice medical history.
That pin was removed six months...
So a little piece broke off during removal.
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.
Tell that to the guys on the Kursk.
And how exactly did it get from his arm to the back of his neck?
Body attacks any foreign object.
Inflammatory reaction could erode it into a vein.
Fragment gets a free ride.
To his lungs maybe, not his neck.
Yeah, an alien chip makes more sense.
The real mystery is that you didn't actually screw up.
You okay?
Fine.
Tripped.
Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck.
Apparently didn't bleed to death.
Now that's weird.
He clotted on his own?
Sure did.
So first there was no bleeding disorder.
Then there was.
Now there's not again.
Which is impossible.
Or Foreman screwed up.
Two out of three tests agree with my findings.
Lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.
So you're just gonna keep cutting him?
Until what?
This test is different.
We'll draw some blood, and see if any clotting factors are low or missing.
But why haven't the other tests...
We've got three results.
They haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.
Or two of them.
Is it possible the problem isn't his blood?
It's just psychological?
I mean, he almost killed himself.
He wasn't trying to hurt himself.
No, he was just looking for an alien tracking device.
I have time for one more.
Can't blame you for spending extra time down here.
I heard the Artist Formerly Known as Gimp is back upstairs.
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.
She's busy.
I'll take it.
Oh, my God!
You're...
You're okay!
Have we met?
I was one of your doctors.
You were in a vegetative state when you left here last week.
Addison's disease.
All I needed was cortisol, and my brain turned on like a switch.
This is amazing!
Surprised you didn't know.
How would I know?
Not quite my old self yet.
Baby steps, the doctors tell me.
Now...
With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?
How would I...
I wanna have sex with my wife, and I was hoping that maybe you could...
Viagra?
You're here for Viagra?
A bucketful would be nice.
Dr. Cuddy.
Hi.
It's completely unethical.
He was reckless with a patient.
He was right.
But he didn't know that.
He needs at least some glimmer of humility.
Why does he need that?
Because other people have that?
Why does he need to be like other people?
He needs to be less reckless.
Well, you did it.
He's dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions.
He's in pain.
How much pain?
Why?
You know this is affecting him, don't you?
Telling him that he got his last case right won't do anything to help him.
It'll make him less depressed.
Which might not help his leg.
But you don't know.
Just let me run a PET scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.
If it is, the ketamine isn't working anymore, and he's headed for a huge crash.
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault, and I will tell him the truth.
Too tight?
My parents think I'm crazy.
No, they don't.
They're just worried about you.
That's all.
I'm not weird.
It's just that weird things keep happening to me.
Slight pinch.
If you make me better, do you think the aliens will leave me alone?
I don't think they're gonna be bothering you for much longer.
Are you lying again?
No.
We figure this out, everything's gonna be okay.
(PANTING)
Still with us?
(GASPING)
NURSE:
Let's go.
CHASE:
Pulmonary edema, stage-two hypertensive crisis.
What is happening?
Wait outside.
Get him oxygen, and start him on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.
Get them outside!
He's in ICU, systolic is hovering around 170.
I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.
Trade-off being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke,
MI and blindness.
I'm open to suggestions.
Solve the case.
Kidneys could explain...
Kidneys are clean.
Tell me he's a mutant-human hybrid.
It is a bleeding disorder.
Clancy tested positive for Von Willebrand's.
I didn't screw up.
How could he clot on his own two out of three times?
Maybe he cheated.
CHASE:
Right.
Kids always cheat on their bleeding-time tests.
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.
I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what The Rock was cooking.
I meant, he's clotting right now, and he's in hypertensive crisis.
Maybe the two are related.
What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?
Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors.
Even someone low on Von Willebrand's could theoretically clot.
And the first time Clancy clotted, he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction.
He could've easily been hypertensive.
I know I get worked up when I cut microchip tracking implants out of my neck.
Sounds like a cheat to me.
Yeah, we get it.
Okay, what's the differential for a seven-year-old boy suffering multiple hypertensive crises?
We think the problem is in your son's heart.
We need to do a procedure called a transesophageal echo.
Okay, and that will fix his heart?
That will tell us where the problem is, hopefully.
Then we can fix him.
Listen, this isn't really part of my job, but he's worried that you think he's crazy.
Well, isn't he?
There are still plenty of other explanations for what's going on.
It's important he knows you believe in him, even if you don't.
FOREMAN:
It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.
Why don't I have a high-def in my office?
I'm a department head.
There are no structural defects.
Valves are intact.
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Foreman, you gotta steal this thing for me.
Let me ring up one of the homies.
The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears.
The problem's gotta be somewhere else.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
(HEARTBEAT THUMPING)
You're wrong, House.
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?
There.
Where?
Right there.
Left side, no movement.
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.
How do you see something not move if nothing's moving?
I need a laser pointer.
We don't have a laser pointer.
Well, why not?
Who's gonna take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer?
Right here.
A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest.
So you've found an arrhythmia?
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhtyhmia.
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.
Go get me those myocytes.
I wanna talk to them in my office.
How's the kid doing?
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.
Most of it, anyway.
Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click, "Yes, I am 18?"
Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.
What's going on with the leg?
First, tell me what's going on with the boobs.
If you're feeling pain...
They're firmer.
It's called an underwire.
I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
I think it's hormones.
As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus...
Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
...then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.
After you workout, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.
Guess I should be saying, "Mazel tov.
" Who gets to pass out the cigars?
I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.
Boy or girl?
You got a name picked out?
I'm not pregnant.
My leg doesn't hurt.
You're in denial.
No, I'm not!
Oh, you got me.
(SIGHS)
If I thought that my leg was deteriorating, don't you think I'd want to take steps to prevent that?
(SIGHS)
Okay.
(PAGER BEEPING)
Gotta go.
(GROANS)
(EXCLAIMS)
(SIGHS)
Here's Clancy's DNA.
And here's the DNA from that piece of his heart we just biopsied.
That is impossible.
Run it again.
We already did and once more after that.
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body.
Alien DNA.
Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.
That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.
Nitrous acid or ethidium-bromide exposure.
First, Daddy was a rapist.
Now he's a chemist.
CHASE:
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia or both.
Is your leg hurting?
Is that question helping?
You're leaning.
You're sitting.
You're evading.
My head's hurting.
Please, someone, give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA.
We could search his home for toxins, fungals and radiation.
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with strep, we don't conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from.
We cure it.
We know he's got the stuff inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.
Where do we cut?
Chances are, it's not just in his heart.
Well, we got lucky with the heart.
Myocytes contract.
We could see that these weren't working.
I don't know how the hell we're gonna find it anywhere else.
What if we take the heart cells with the bad DNA, and we tag them?
Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
It's the same way we search for cancer.
The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells.
We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein, we flush it throughout his system, and the similar cells light up like light bulbs.
Okay, let's do that.
You have to tell him.
He said he wasn't in any pain.
He's lying.
Of course he's lying.
We need another plan.
Don't talk about it that way.
What way?
"Plan. "
It sounds like we're conspiring against him.
I'm gonna tell him.
No, you're not.
Then come up with a cunning plan and fast.
She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is.
What's this machine do?
Makes a lot of noise, and it's gonna help us figure out what's wrong with you.
You think House has lost a step?
He's fine.
There.
Clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur.
Explains the intermittent-bleeding disorder.
'Cause I don't need to subject myself to House's torture if there's no upside.
I'm telling you, he's fine.
We missed some affected cells in his heart.
Explains the continuing hypertensive issues.
You said the last case really threw him, and now suddenly...
I was wrong.
So you changed your mind.
Why?
His brilliant ideas on this case have all been yours.
There's the reason for him needing glasses.
Apparently, it's a symptom.
It means the condition predates...
You don't change your mind without a reason.
Now, what do you know?
House didn't blow the last case.
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.
Cuddy and Wilson are trying to teach him some humility.
Scan is complete.
Three hot spots, but nothing in his brain.
House's original theory was right.
It is not neurological.
TODD.:
Is he going to be able to walk?
CHASE.:
His leg should be functional after some rehab.
STEPHANIE: "Functional"?
What does that mean?
He'll be able to walk, but not run?
He'll have a limp?
If everything goes well, he'll walk.
He'll run.
He'll probably be even stronger than he is now.
When we close him up, we'll move over to his other leg, snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart.
Once the affected areas are removed, his normal tissue will step back in, do its job.
He should have no more problems with his blood pressure.
After confirming those areas are clear, we'll start the final procedure.
We're gonna insert a needle through the pupil and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina.
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?
Yeah, it's clear.
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.
Thank you.
Do you wanna go for a run?
What do you want?
I want you to run.
When did you become an enabler?
I'm enabling you to exercise.
Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab, muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.
I'd rather not become dependent on pain pills to get through my day.
You're just like any other patient, running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
You're scared the ketamine treatment's wearing off, that it was just a torturous window to the good life.
What part of "poop" didn't you understand?
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?
It's my leg.
We've known each other a long time.
You're not always right, House.
You've proven that lately.
STEPHANIE:
What's happening to him?
He's seizing.
I need clonazepam.
I thought you got it all.
Yeah, yell at me.
That'll fix your kid.
Obviously, we missed some foreign tissue.
There's something still in him.
The hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe.
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you're wrong again.
We didn't miss anything.
Brain scan was completely clean.
Our tag must not have penetrated the blood-brain barrier.
Don't use an IV this time.
Get it right into the brain.
No cells are lighting up.
His brain is clean.
It is not neurological.
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.
What if it is there, but didn't show up on the scan?
What if the tag just doesn't work in his brain?
Brain cells are structurally different, express a different protein.
So how do we find it?
Where are we going?
I am going to think.
Send the kid home.
What do you mean?
Make sure his blood pressure's stabilized, and send him home.
What, like nothing ever happened?
We cured his bleeding disorder, removed all the damaged cells we could find.
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.
Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.
It's more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
He had a convulsion.
May be epilepsy.
May be psychological.
May be nothing.
If the kid gets sick again, it'll give us another clue.
We can start searching again.
If he doesn't, doesn't matter.
Send him home.
(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE STARTS)
House.
You're just giving up on this kid?
You gotta know when to stop.
You don't stop.
You never stop.
You just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.
Except on my last case.
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.
This kid obviously has something wrong with him.
When did you develop such strong opinions about my patients?
Last week, you were convinced my patient wasn't sick.
Now you're convinced this one is.
This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.
Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours...
Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg.
That's where we found most of it.
Maybe we should just remove his affected eye completely.
If you have reason to believe that that might help...
I'm not gonna start lopping off body parts, but it's interesting that you give me the green light.
I just want you to do something.
You've been overly supportive this entire week.
Either you're hormonal, or you're guilt-ridden, and it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
I'm not pregnant.
Then what did you do wrong?
He had Addison's.
Your last patient.
You were right.
I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.
(SCOFF)
Oh, your mommy is in such trouble.
She's such a liar.
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...
How does one person end up with two different sets of DNA?
We've been through this.
Our assumptions are faulty.
We've confirmed two different sets of DNA.
We re-ran the sequence.
I didn't say the lab work was faulty.
I said our assumptions were faulty.
We assumed he's a person.
Of course.
The aliens didn't just visit him.
They replaced him.
You're being silly.
What if he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?
I'm not getting the metaphor.
No metaphor.
Chase, you said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?
Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
Kid was right all along.
He was implanted with something, back when he was young.
I mean really young, like 12-cells young.
In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.
But he doesn't have a twin.
Not walking around.
But in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop, so doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth.
Problem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.
Two brothers get stuck sharing.
There's no bunk beds, so they cuddle up to keep warm, and they never untangle.
He's two people in one.
It's called chimerism.
Unfortunately, his brother's like a bad doubles partner.
The guy just takes up space, gets in the way.
Clancy's body thinks that he's gonna put away the easy winners.
His brother just keeps swatting balls into the net.
We gotta get him off the court.
So does that mean that you can find the bad cells in his brain or not?
Sure, abandon the metaphor.
Fine.
Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks.
If we induce an alien abduction...
Wait.
What the hell are you talking about?
The foreign DNA has got to be in a portion of your son's brain that makes him believe that he's being abducted.
If we stimulate those neurons with an electric probe, we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating.
Your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will remain dark.
Those are the ones we cut out.
You're talking about brain surgery.
I'm talking about really cool brain surgery.
One of your sons will die, but the taller one won't be so annoying anymore.
So I have a twin?
Not really.
What's on the card?
A light bulb.
Start us out at 10.
I'm not doing that.
That was all me, kid.
Sorry.
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.
He lives inside me?
Sort of.
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.
You're in sensory.
You're getting closer.
What do you see on this one?
Moon and stars.
So I am kind of weird?
We're all kind of weird.
No!
Clancy?
We got something.
What do you see?
The light.
Here they come, I think.
Brain waves indicate a mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.
Any dark spots?
Area's too fuzzy.
Hallucination isn't strong enough.
Turn up the juice.
His blood pressure's already 160 over 110.
Any higher...
Riding the short bus is better than not breathing.
Take us to 100.
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.
Crank it up higher.
You've already exceeded the preset maximum.
Next step's brain damage.
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.
(GASPING)
Clancy?
Can you hear me?
Clancy?
You got them.
Yep.
We got them all.
Close him up.
Everything's gonna be normal again.
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?
What now?
She lied to me.
She cured my patient with my diagnosis, then lied to me about it.
That doesn't sound like her.
You're right.
Does sound like you, though.
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?
Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.
So what was the plan?
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case that I'd reevaluate my entire life, question the nature of truth and goodness and become Cameron?
Something like that.
More that if we told you the truth, that you solved a case based on absolutely no medical proof, you'd think you were God.
And I was worried your wings would melt.
God doesn't limp.

Mom!
- I'm thirsty.
- I just gave you water.
I want juice.
It's bedtime.
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
Mom!
What do you want, Clance?
Hi, Dad.
Go to bed.
- Can I turn the TV on?
- TV is only for the daytime.
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.
Go to bed.
Dad, what if...
What if they come to get me again?
Nobody is coming to get you.
OK?
Go to bed.
Now.
Come on, Clancy.
It's time to get up.
- I guess he's already up.
- That's a first.
I-I will, uh, I'll see if he needs breakfast.
Hey, Clance, you hungry?
Hon, he's not down here.
You sure?
Clancy?
Clancy?
Where are you?

Where is he?
You're gonna be in big trouble when I find you.
Honey, come out right now, wherever you are.
This is not funny.

Where's the sweat and the B.O.?
You've taken such pride in bathing us all in your musk.
- Showered at home.
- And yet you're earlier than usual.
Is this an intervention?
It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore.
I am, however, still hooked on phonics.
If you did your morning run and showered at home, you'd be later than usual.
Thought of you in the shower.
How's your leg?
You seem to be favoring your left side.
I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday.
- Makes all the difference in the world.
- You've taken the stairs every day.
- Did I need a restraining order?
- You slack on your rehab, the muscle will weaken.
And your leg will hurt again.
Looks like the Ketamine treatment might not stick.
Or maybe we've made him depressed because we're lying to him.
- Telling him he got that case wrong.
- We didn't hurt him.
The pain isn't...
He gets depressed, he stops exercising.
He stops exercising, the muscle atrophies.
The muscle atrophies, the pain returns.
Maybe he stopped exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.
The Ketamine could work perfectly and he would still be back on his cane popping Vicodin again.
You can't tell him.
He got lucky.
There was no medical...
He was right.
We tell him he was right, and we're feeding his addiction.
Without Vicodin, he's only got one to focus on.
- Well, he's not gonna O.D. on puzzles.
- No, it's not gonna hurt him.
But he could just as easily have killed that patient.
We have a tiny window of time here where House may be healthy enough to change.
And based on that limp, the window's closing fast.
Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy.
Had all his vaccinations.
Fractured his right ulna at age three, chicken pox at age five...
Did he ever get his feelings hurt?
I'll need to know that too.
You are 0 for 1 since you came back.
We just wanna make sure...
Rectal bleeding plus alien abduction fantasies, most likely sexual abuse.
Penetration causes the bleed, trauma causes the fantasy.
E. R. ran a rape kit, found no evidence of tearing, semen, or pubic hairs.
I think we should talk to the kid.
Why?
In case he's telling the truth?
You're a believer, aren't you?
I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy and ten million billion planets in the universe, that we're the only ones with life.
No.
But
I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our backdoors.
There is new research indicating a link between neurological problems
- and bleeding disorders.
- Perfect.
Especially if there were neurological problems.
What part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?
- It wasn't a hallucination.
- What?
- You think the kid...
- Is having nightmares.
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything other than wanting to sleep with mommy.
Which just leaves us with one symptom, the bloody tuchus.
Which can easily be explained by a G. I. problem or a bleeding disorder.
Check his coags with a PT, PTT, and bleeding time.
Prep him for endoscopies from above and below.
Gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm, okay?
Then I'm gonna time how long it takes for you to stop bleeding.
This is gonna sting a little, so you might want to look the other way.
Are those windows locked?
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.
Good. 'Cause they know I'm here.
Clancy... don't bother the doctor with this stuff.
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?
They put a chip in my neck so they can keep track of me.
I can feel it back there.
Clancy, you know there is nothing back there.
- There is.
- Let me see.
Lean forwards.
And they have this other thing.
And they put it... in between these two ribs.
Always on this side.
And then they move it around my insides.
- It hurts.
- You know what, Clancy?
I think I might have found the chip back there.
And I think I might be able to get it out.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
Okay, lean forwards.
Now hold very still, okay?
Got it.
I'm seven... not three.
All you did was pinch my neck.
Sorry.
His alien abduction story, the level of detail is...
I don't know where he gets it from.
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books.
Great.
You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.
So, it's a simple bleeding disorder.
No.
Blood tests were all normal.
And he clotted in six minutes.
So it's a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.
I didn't screw up the test.
So it's a U.F.O.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.
Either you screwed up the test or I screwed up my analysis of this case.
If you screwed up, I don't have to cry myself to sleep.
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.
How could I screw up a simple bleeding time test?
Maybe you were abducted and lost time.
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.
You're sure?
I had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.
So you're saying Chase did screw up.
Or Foreman screwed up.
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playin' the dozens.
You're at a huge cultural disadvantage here, Chase.
Take a couple minutes to think of a witty retort.
So we have contradicting bleeding time tests.
If we run labs to check his clotting fac- tors, we can confirm which one's right.
Yeah, testing.
Nice idea.
Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent.
Looks better in the paperwork too.
Hey, Foreman, your mama's so fat, when her beeper goes off, people think she's backing up.
Where's Clancy?
He's asleep.
He's...
House!
Clancy's gone missing.
Oh, no!
You take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on Tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint.
Let's pray he hasn't gone into hyperdrive.
We'll never catch him.
Clancy?
I had to go where there are no windows so I could get the chip out like you said.
God.
- I can feel it, I just can't grab it.
- Clancy, stop!
There is no chip.
We're gonna clean you up and we're gonna go back to your room.
You can't do things like this.
Your parents--
Said it might not even be terrestrial.
- Really?
- No, you idiot, it's titanium.
Like from a surgical pin.
Like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago.
- Nice medical history.
- That pin was removed six months after.
So a little piece broke off during removal.
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.
Tell that to guys on the Kursk.
And how exactly did it get from his arm to the back of his neck?
Body attacks any foreign object.
Inflammatory reaction could erode it into a vein, fragment gets a free ride.
To his lungs, maybe.
Not his neck.
Yeah, an alien chip makes more sense.
The real mystery is that you didn't actually screw up.
You okay?
Fine.
Tripped.
Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck and apparently didn't bleed to death.
- Now, that's weird.
- He clotted on his own?
Sure did.
So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there is not again.
- Which is impossible.
- Or Foreman screwed up.
Two out of three tests agree with my findings.
Well, lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.
So you're just gonna keep cutting him?
Until what?
This test is different.
We draw some blood and see if any clotting factors are low or missing.
But why haven't the other tests--
We've got three results that haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.
Or two of them.
Is it possible the problem isn't his blood?
It's just psychological.
- I mean, he almost killed himself.
- He wasn't trying to hurt himself.
No... he was just looking for an alien tracking device.
I have time for one more.
Don't blame you for spending extra time down here.
Heard the artist formerly known as gimp is back upstairs.
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.
She's busy.
I'll take it.
Oh, my God.
You're...
How...
You're okay.
Have we met?
I was one of your doctors.
You were in a vegetative state when you left here last week.
Addison's disease.
All I needed was cortisol and my brain turned on like a switch.
- This is amazing.
- Surprised
- you didn't know.
- How would I know?
Not quite my old self yet.
- Baby steps, the doctors tell me.
- With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?
- How would I...
- I wanna have sex with my wife.
And I was hoping that maybe...
- You could...
- Viagra?
- You're here for Viagra?
- A bucketful would be nice.
Dr. Cuddy.
- It's completely unethical.
- He was reckless with a patient.
- He was right.
- But he didn't know that.
He needs at least some glimmer of humility.
Why does he need that?
Because other people have that?
Why does he need to be like other people?
- He needs to be less reckless.
- Well, you did it.
He's dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions.
He's in pain.
- How much pain?
- Why?
You know this is affecting him, don't you?
Telling him that he got his last case right won't do anything to help him.
- It'll make him less depressed.
- Which might not help his leg.
But you don't know.
Just let me run a PET scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.
If it is, the Ketamine isn't working any- more and he's headed for a huge crash.
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault and I will tell him the truth.
Too tight?
- My parents think I'm crazy.
- No, they don't.
They're just worried about you, that's all.
I'm not weird.
It's just that weird things keep happening to me.
Slight pinch.
If you make me better, do you think the aliens will leave me alone?
I don't think they're gonna be bothering you for much longer.
- You lying again?
- No.
We figure this out, everything's gonna be okay.
You still with us?
Pulmonary edema, stage two hypertensive crisis.
- What is happening?
- Wait outside.
Get him oxygen.
Start him on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.
Get them outside!
He's in ICU.
Systolic is hovering around 170.
I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.
The trade-off being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke,
- M. I., and blindness.
- I'm open to suggestions.
Solve the case.
- Kidneys could explain...
- Kidneys are clean.
Tell me he's a mutant/human hybrid.
It is a bleeding disorder.
Clancy tested positive for Von Willebrand's.
I didn't screw up.
How could he clot on his own two out of three times?
- Maybe he cheated.
- Right.
Kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.
I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking.
I meant he's clotting right now and he's in hypertensive crisis.
Maybe the two are related.
What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?
Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors.
Someone low on Von Willebrands could theoretically clot.
And the first time Clancy clotted, he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction.
He could have easily been hypertensive.
I know I get worked up when I cut micro- chip tracking implants out of my neck.
- Sounds like a cheat to me.
- Yeah, we get it.
Okay, what's the differential for seven-year-old boys suffering multiple hypertensive crises?
We think the problem is in your son's heart.
We need to do a procedure called a transesophegeal echo.
Okay, and that will fix his heart?
That will tell us where the problem is.
Hopefully.
Then we can fix him.
L isten... this isn't really part of my job, but... he's worried that you think he's crazy.
Well, isn't he?
There are still plenty of other explanations for what's going on.
It's important he knows you believe in him.
Even if you don't.
It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.
Why don't I have a hi-def in my office?
I'm a department head.
- There are no structural defects.
- Valves are intact.
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Foreman, you gotta steal this thing for me.
Let me ring up one of the homies.
The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears.
The problem's got to be somewhere else.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
You're wrong, House.
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?
- There.
- Where?
Right there.
Left side.
No movement.
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.
How do you see something not move if nothing's moving?
I need a laser pointer.
- We don't have a laser pointer.
- Well, why not?
Who's gonna take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer?
Right... here.
A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest.
So you found an arrhythmia.
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhythmia.
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.
Go get me those myocytes.
I want to talk to them in my office.
How's the kid doing?
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.
Most of it anyway.
Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click "Yes, I am 18"?
Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.
What's going on with the leg?
First tell me what's going on with the boobs.
- If you're feeling pain...
- They're firmer.
It's called an underwire.
- I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
- I think it's hormones.
As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus--
Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
Then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.
After you work out, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the Ketamine failed.
Guess I should be saying mazel tov.
- Who gets to pass out the cigars?
- I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.
Boy or girl?
You got a name picked out?
- I'm not pregnant.
- My leg doesn't hurt.
- You're in denial.
- No, I'm not!
Oh, you got me.
If I thought that my leg was deteriorating,
Don't you think I'd want to take steps to prevent that?
Okay.
Gotta go.
Here's Clancy's DNA.
And here's the DNA from that piece of his heart we just biopsied.
That is impossible.
- Run it again.
- We already did.
And once more after that.
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body.
Alien DNA.
Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.
That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.
Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.
First daddy was a rapist, now he's a chemist.
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia or both.
- Is your leg hurting?
- Is that question helping?
- You're leaning.
- You're sitting.
- You're evading.
- My head's hurting.
Please, someone give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA.
We could search his home for toxins, fungals, and radiation.
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with a strep, we don't conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from, we cure it.
We know he's got this inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.
Where do we cut?
Chances are it's not just in his heart.
We got lucky with the heart.
Myocytes contract, we could see that these weren't working.
I don't know how the hell we're gonna find it anywhere else.
What if we take the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?
Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
It's the same way we search for cancer.
The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells.
We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein.
We flush it throughout his system and the similar cells light up like... lightbulbs.
Okay.
Let's do that.
- You have to tell him.
- He said he wasn't in any pain.
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- We need another plan.
- Don't talk about it that way.
What way?
Plan.
Sounds like we're conspiring against him.
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No, you're not.
Then come up with a cunning plan and fast.
She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is.
What's this machine do?
It makes a lot of noise.
And it's gonna help us figure out what's wrong with you.
You think House has lost a step?
He's fine.
There, a clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur.
Explains the intermittent bleeding disorder.
'Cause I don't need to subject myself to House's torture if there's no upside.
I'm telling you, he's fine.
We missed some affected cells in his heart.
Explains the continuing hypertensive issues.
You said the last case really threw him.
And now suddenly...
I was wrong.
So you changed your mind.
Why?
His brilliant ideas on this case have all been yours.
There's the reason for him needing glasses.
Apparently it's a symptom.
Means the condition predates--
You don't change your mind without a reason.
What do you know?
House... didn't blow the last case.
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.
Cuddy and Wilson are trying to teach him some humility.
Scan is complete.
Three hot spots, but nothing in his brain.
House's original theory was right.
It is not neurological.
Is he gonna be able to walk?
His leg should be functional after some rehab.
Functional?
What does that mean?
He's be able to walk but not run?
He'll have a limp?
If everything goes well, he'll walk, he'll run.
He'll probably be even stronger than he is now.
When we close him up, we'll move over to his other leg.
Snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart.
Once the affected areas are removed, his normal tissue will set back in and do its job.
He should have no more problems with his blood pressure.
After confirming those areas are clear, we'll start the final procedure.
I'm gonna insert a needle through the pupil and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina.
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?
Yeah.
It's clear.
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.
Thank you.
You wanna go for a run?
What do you want?
I want you to run.
When did you become an enabler?
I'm enabling you to exercise.
Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab.
Muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.
I'd rather not become dependent on pain pills to get through my day.
You're just like any other patient.
Running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
You're scared the Ketamine treatment's wearing off.
That it was just a.... torturous window to the good life.
What part of poop didn't you understand?
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?
It's my leg.
We've known each other a long time.
You're not always right, House.
You've proven that lately.
- What's happening to him?
- He's seizing.
I need clonazepam.
I thought you got it all!
Yeah, yell at me.
That'll fix the kid.
Obviously we missed some foreign tissue.
There's something still in him.
The hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe.
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you were wrong, again.
We didn't miss anything.
The brain scan was completely clean.
Our tag must not have penetrated the blood brain barrier.
Don't use an IV this time, get it right into the brain.
No cells are lighting up.
His brain is clean.
It is not neurological.
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.
What if it is there, but didn't show up on the scan?
What if the tag just doesn't work in his brain?
Brain cells are structurally different.
They express a different protein.
So how do we find it?
Where are we going?
I am going to think.
Send the kid home.
What do you mean?
Make sure his blood pressure is stabilized and send him home.
- Like nothing ever happened?
- We cured his bleeding disorder and removed all the damaged cells we could find.
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.
Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.
It's more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
He had a convulsion.
Maybe epilepsy, maybe psychological.
Maybe nothing.
If the kid gets sick again, that'll give us another clue and we'll start searching again.
If he doesn't, it doesn't matter.
Send him home.
House!
You're just giving up on this kid?
You gotta know when to stop.
You don't stop.
You never stop, you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.
Except on my last case.
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.
This kid obviously has something wrong with him.
When did you develop such strong opinions about my patients?
Last week you were convinced that my patient wasn't sick.
- Now you're convinced this one is.
- This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.
Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours...
Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg.
It's where we found most of it.
Maybe we should just remove his affected eye completely.
If you have reason to believe that that might help...
I'm not gonna start lopping off body parts.
But it's interesting that you give me the green light.
I just want you to do something.
You've been overly supportive this entire week.
Well, either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden.
And it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
- I'm not pregnant.
- Then what did you do wrong?
He had Addison's.
Your last patient.
You were right.
I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip Van Winkle.
Oh, your mommy's in such trouble.
She's such a liar.
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...
How does one person... end up with two different sets of DNA?
- We've been through this.
- Our assumptions are faulty.
We've confirmed two different sets of DNA.
We re-ran the sequence.
I didn't say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty.
We assumed he's a person.
Of course.
The aliens didn't just visit him, they replaced him.
You're being silly.
What if he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?
- I'm not getting the metaphor.
- No metaphor.
Chase said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?
- Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
- Kid was right all along.
He was implanted with something.
Back when he was young.
I mean, really young.
Like 12 cells young.
In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.
But he doesn't have a twin.
Not walking around...
But in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop.
So doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth.
The problem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.
Two brothers get stuck sharing, but there's no bunk beds.
So they cuddle up to keep warm and they never untangle.
He's two people in one.
It's called chimerism.
Unfortunately, his brother's... like a bad doubles partner.
The guy just takes up space, gets in the way.
Clancy's body thinks he's gonna put away the easy winners, his brother just keeps swatting the balls into the net.
We gotta get him off the court.
So does that mean that you can find the bad cells in his brain or not?
Sure, abandon the metaphor.
Fine.
Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks.
If we induce an alien abduction...
Wait, what the hell are you talking about?
The foreign DNA has got to be in the portion of your son's brain that makes him believe that he's being abducted.
If we stimulate those neurons with an electric probe, we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating.
Your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will remain dark.
Those are the ones we cut out.
You're talking about brain surgery.
I'm talking about really cool brain surgery.
One of your sons will die.
But the taller one won't be so annoying anymore.
- So I have a twin?
- Not really.
What's on the card?
Light bulb.
Start us out at ten.
I'm not doing that.
It was all me, kid.
Sorry.
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.
- He lives inside me.
- Sort of.
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.
You're in sensory.
Getting closer.
- What do you see on this one?
- Moon and stars.
So...
I am kind of weird?
We're all kind of weird.
No!
- Clancy?
- We got something.
- What do you see?
- The light.
Here they come.
I think.
Brain waves indicate mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.
- Any dark spots?
- Area's too fuzzy.
Hallucination isn't strong enough.
Turn up the juice.
His blood pressure's already at 160 over 110.
Any higher and...
Riding the short bus is better than not breathing.
Take us to 100.
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.
Crank it up higher.
You've already exceeded the pre-set maximum.
Next step's brain damage.
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.
Clancy, can you hear me?
Clancy?
You got them.
We got 'em all.
Close him up.
Everything's gonna be normal again.
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?
What now?
She lied to me.
She cured my patient with my diagnosis, then she lied to me about it.
- That doesn't sound like her.
- You're right.
Does sound like you, though.
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?
Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.
So what was the plan?
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case that I'd re-evaluate my entire life, question the nature of truth and goodness,
- and become Cameron?
- Something like that.
More that if we told you the truth, that you'd solved a case based on absolutely no medical proof,
you'd think you were God.
And I was worried your wings would melt.
God doesn't limp.

How old is she?
I heard she's twenty.
I heard she's inheriting everything.
Of course, she's the only family that's left.
I heard she's looking for her brother.
Then her brother gets the inheritance, too?
There are things that I see which can't be seen.
The people around me.
Their eyes on me are cold.
Colder than the snow.
The whole world is cold like this.
Where am I?
What hope do I have to live on?
I don't need anything.

hello, Julian.
- Give me a cigarette.
- Yeah.
How've you been?
Been great.
Where's Ryu Jin?
He's in the car.
Where's my car?
Well, it got smashed.
It got into an accident.
I swear I didn't do it.
It was Jin.
Well, it's been a few days.
At that intersection by the club.
Jin took the car out.
He dodged an approaching car.
But that crazy bastard crossed the median.
So he tried to avoid it, but wham.
Oh that?
That's Ryu Jin.
I told you he was in the car.
People get small like that after they die.
Julian?
Yes, it's me.
- How come i can't reach you?
- I was out of the country.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- How have you been?
- Fine, and you?
I'm fine as always.
- You missed me, didn't you?
- Of course.
What are you doing today?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you'd go to jail.
Forget it.
He said he was going to take care of everything.
I didn't do it.
Well, all women are the same.
I'll make the lou for six months.
Thanks for this.
Don't do this.
Julian.
Don't go.
You know how much I love you.
I don't need love.
Is this Ryu Jin's cell phone?
It's mine now.
Let's go to the club.
I got lots of money!
Julian!
- Julian!
- Julian!
Where've you been?
So handsome.
Julian, look at me.
I love you everyone.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Julian, julian.
My club's number one host, julian.
You've been through a lot.
But you know what?
I found out about it all while you were in prison.
So you wanted to go independent after swindling money from rich girls?
You know that bad rumors get around in this town.
Shut up!
Don't try to play games with me.
Look at me straight in the eyes.
Even your wonderful piece down there is through now.
What a cool breeze.
But i smell a woman's groin in the wind.
Shit, this isn't right.
People have misunderstood one thing about me.
A guy like me can never fall.
You got that right!
The king of adonis club will never fall.
So how about we go independent now as you planned.
Your fan club will be waiting in line all across the country.
I'll do my best to help.
Shit!
You bastard.
You crazy bastard!
Get out of the truck!
You're a real wisecrack.
Get out right now.
- Long time no see.
- You're a really funny guy, with that big car of yours.
Hey!
You!
You two know each other?
Damn it!
What the hell is this?
Huh?
Do you know how to drive?
This is crazy.
You look really beat.
Yes, I sure am.
I have a problem.
I know.
I heard you went straight to the club.
That's why I came to you right away.
You know?
Really?
Please help me out.
Let's see.
Total, 2.87 million dollars.
Plus, the 6-month interest on the loan.
Sorry.
One month.
This clock is ticking on your behalf.
The world is unpredictable.
Fun, isn't it?
Hey!
Wait.
Wait.
2.87 million dollars in one month?
Come on.
That's crazy!
Then, shall we make it three days?
When you were a big shot, you were the one who demanded 500,000 dollars in three days.
So you should know the rules.
You should've lived with modesty.
And don't forget the one who made you what you are.
It's Julian.
Call me at this number.
Shit.
Why'd you bring that bastard here?
Ji-Hyae!
- You've got no manners.
- Why the fuck are you cursing?
Go away!
- Yes, it's Julian.
- Where do you think you are?
No way, so what happened?
So there was no other choice.
In that tiny basement,
I spent that winter with my insane alcoholic father.
What a rotten mother.
How could she have abandoned you?
Don't know.
He looked at me... with a very sad face one day.
And then he caressed his hand on my face.
I really hated it.
His hand was damp and smelled strange.
And the moment he lit the cigarette in his mouth,
he burned.
In flames.
He burned in front of my eyes.
Half of his body was burned to a crisp.
That's nonsense.
It's a lie again, right?
Of course it's a lie.
Come on.
It was true?
Come here,
I'll hug you.
No, I have a meeting at three.
Here you are.
You're such a lovely woman.
Six months for the lou?
I told you, it's my present.
Money, money.
What?
Only one grand?
What bad manners.
It's enough for just a pair of shoes.
- Dom perignon vintage, please.
- Yes.
Who keeps calling a hundred times a day?
One of Ryu Jin's clients, I bet.
Listen to the message.
There's probably no password.
You know the saying, your girl is my girl, and my girl is yours.
Or... regulars follow wherever the famous chef goes.
How much?
My name is Park Ki-Young.
Your father's lawyer.
What does it say?
You can tell if they're rich...
I'm calling you to talk about your inheritance.
Your father has passed away.
I feel really bad for the guy.
He said he went through a lot when he left home after his parents divorced.
His parents are all dead and now their son.
Only thing left is the money.
Whether you're rich or a host, you're all the same when you die.
Don't you agree?
Oh yeah, he said once that he's got a younger sister.
Then she'll get all that money.
This is his younger sister?
Yeah, she's twenty.
Twenty.
He wrote letters to her everyday.
Everyday?
Yes, everyday.
Crazy bastard.
- Play this.
- Okay.
Let's go at least.
We'll hand over the ashes, and offer our grievances.
Tell them how sorry we are and shed some tears.
That way we'll get compensated with some money.
He's rich.
- Jin, what do you want?
- Rice.
Anything.
Nothing hard about it.
We're the only ones who can give this to Jin's family.
Let's go.
What if you can't pay him back in a month?
He'll kill me.
What?
Then he won't get his money.
I don't want to die, that's why I pay him back.
Damn it, it's raining.
It's pouring.
- What a house.
- Hop out.
Look at that house.
It's a huge mansion.
What is your name?
Micky.
Cute and fun Micky.
Not that, your real name.
Kim Tae-Ho?
Yes, Tae-Ho.
From now on, forget about Julian and Micky.
You're Kim Tae-Ho, Ryu Jin's secretary.
What?
There's also a woman in that house.
Hold on.
- Who is it?
- Ryu Jin.
You're going to impersonate him?
You're no Ryu Jin.
I'm not going.
I'm scared.
You'll go to jail again if you get caught.
Trying to take me to jail with you?
I'm scared.
Thank you for coming.
I'm Park Ki-Yong, the one who called you.
She's been taking care of this house for 15 years.
This is ms.
Lee.
And mr.
Oh here has been running your father's company after his death.
Pleased to meet you.
This is my secretary, Kim Tae-Ho.
And my sister?
- Mr. Park.
- I know it's a formality, but we need to make sure about your background, so... so?
Check my identification?
Mother loved the clock on that wall.
But it's not here anymore.
It used to hang there.
That... mother picked a picture herself, and hung it here.
It's all been changed.
Was it that bastard again?
I didn't come here for this.
So is that why the apple tree in the yard was thrown away?
There was such a thing?
The apple tree that mother raised!
We came to this house after you and your mother had left... it was there!
Mother and I raised that tree ourselves!
Where's Min?
Huh?
Min.
Min!
Who are you to yell in here?
Min, it's me, your brother.
Don't let any strangers into my house.
Min, it's raining outside!
My sister can't see?
Actually, i was going to tell you.
Min, wait!
Min, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
Min!
It's been so long.
My only image of you as a kid... jin!
Min!
I'm sorry, min.
From now on, I will... go back!
You and mom died 16 years ago.
I've never once forgotten about you.
You know that.
It was all in the letters.
Letters?
There were letters?
No, we didn't receive any letters.
Mr. Park.
Compensate him and send him away.
In your father's will, your brother is also entitled to the inheritance.
You must sign first for the inheritance
- to be settled.
- I told you he's dead!
Why do I need to sign for a dead person?
Okay, you take care of it.
Because I don't need that money.
Then get out of here right now.
Min!
We're the only two left.
I can't leave you alone and go.
If you smile... if you smile like you once did, then I'll leave.
Until then,
I want to be with you.
Now are you satisfied?
Leave.
Min, my love for you...
I don't need love.
Cerebral thrombosis?
She fell sick when she was 13, and totally lost her sight at 15.
What did that father of ours do at the time?
He did the best he could for Min.
He took her to all the famous hospitals.
He even took her overseas many times.
Although she was in a critical state, she survived thanks to him.
You'll find it comfortable for your stay here.
I'll clean up the room on the third floor.
You can move your belongings in there.
Don't worry about me.
I have to go overseas soon for an important business.
This is the room.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
- Have a good rest.
- Yeah.
I was scared out of my wits.
We would've been dead if it wasn't for this ball.
That girl's got a serious temper.
She takes after her brother.
Is your face alright?
Go pack my stuff and bring them here.
There's a fine for every inch ripped even on a pool table.
So imagine scratching Julian's face.
It's a crime.
So my life is in her hands.
He's different from what I had imagined.
As you know, people are influenced by the environment they're raised in.
I'm telling you, it was unreal.
I could feel his mastery.
That teary-eyed acting of his.
I should've recorded that stuff and study it.
But i didn't bring the camera.
Hey!
Do it right.
You missed the nail.
I'm sorry.
You can't get anything right.
You know exactly what an inheritance is?
Study that instead.
Think you'll get the job done?
You two are hopeless anyway.
A ferrari.
Nice.
Delicious.
Thank you for the meal.
There's still some left.
It's bad manners not to finish.
Min usually doesn't eat much.
Then put your dishes away.
- Usually, I...
- ms.
Lee, I wasn't talking to you.
Min!
It's etiquette to take your dishes at least.
Saw that?
A blind person can't do this.
Ryu Min!
Please stop.
There are many people who can do this even though they can't see.
Min!
I'll help you.
Let's go downstairs.
I get scared if you suddenly grab me!
You do?
Sorry, i didn't know.
But... but ms.
Lee can't always be by your side.
So let's put in an effort together so that you can do things yourself.
Is that what you wanted to say?
Don't worry about trivial stuff like that.
Money can handle everything.
I feel the same way.
Min.
Can you hear me?
The most important thing in the world is that can't be bought with money.
Don't weigh money and your heart on the same scale.
Understand?
Min gets scared when many people are around.
She particularly dislikes outsiders coming here.
If something happens, how will you... who did this?
I did not permit this!
Min, shall we play, too?
Ms. Lee.
Yes, I'm here, Min.
Send everyone out.
Send them out this instant!
You're being too mean to the kids.
Who cares?
If I don't like it, that's it.
Yeah?
Then you leave.
Don't lock yourself in, just because you can't see.
Min... don't interfere.
This is a family matter.
Be careful on your way out.
Ms. Lee, what's the best way to grab on to a blind person?
Here, grab on to this.
I thought you've never been outside alone.
I'll help you.
Careful, careful.
Even the smell of the grass is nice.
All I smell is cigarette smoke.
Fine.
I know that you had a hard life.
But I'm here now.
There's only the two of us.
Us two have to live together.
So can't you open your heart a bit?
Oh yeah, you said money is all you need?
Sure you do.
But you think the world will be easy on a blind girl?
Never.
It doesn't work that way.
Min.
I'll take care of everything from now on.
Just trust me and follow me.
Let's make a new start.
I know how you feel.
I'll never leave you.
- You know how I feel?
- Let me finish!
How do you know how I feel?
Know how it feels to gradually lose your sight?
- Min!
- Let go!
Know how it feels to lose the memories you want to cherish?
It would've been better if I was just born blind.
I want you to remember exactly how cruel you've been to me.
I was doing well forgetting.
But now, you're making me remember everything.
Will the stone turn into a lump of gold?
I think you've picked up the wrong stone.
Jin.
Kill me.
Tae-Ho,
I got a favor to ask.
Are you sure?
Don't ask.
I ordered it from a trustworthy website.
But aren't you going overboard?
Who'd give a deadly pill to someone as a gift?
But it does seem possible.
People, you see, don't die so easily.
So what does this cane have to do with it?
A present for my sister.
A mascot of fortune?
What?
A gift?
Min, what are you going to do today?
There are things that you see which can't be seen.
Want to go with me?
Anyway, what's in this?
Oh, that?
Drugs.
Drugs?
Drugs that will make you die.
I thought you wanted to die.
Don't be scared.
It was a joke.
If you say you're going to die again, you'll get a beating, okay?
It'll relieve all your stress!
Come this way!
Grab the trigger and hold the gun like this.
And then shoot.
I'll aim for you and you just shoot, okay?
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Shoot again.
It was close.
What a great couple!
Let me take your picture.
I'll capture a wonderful memory.
Min, wait here.
I'll be right back.
What are you doing?
You were doing great.
She'll hate you again.
Sadness follows happiness.
When it comes, it's very painful.
Right?
You feel like dying.
Min!
Sorry, I got caught up on my way.
It's okay.
Since you promised to protect me anyway.
In your awkward braille letter.
Show me something fun again.
A witch appeared.
The witch tries to kill the princess, but the prince appears.
That sound's from somewhere else.
I know.
Just get the explanation right.
But that witch is really ugly.
Very ugly.
And her cheeks are loose.
Stay still, let me see your face.
It's different from the face i had imagined.
Yes, her temperature has gone down.
Doctor, I did as you told me.
Yes.
I understand.
Good-bye.
Will she be alright?
It's nothing serious, but she'll need to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Then I'll send the car to her first thing in the morning.
Mr. Oh, you seem to look after Min very much.
I'm sorry, I haven't told you yet.
They'll get married soon.
Why haven't you told me before?
I almost mistook them.
It's getting late.
You should get going.
I'll take her to the hospital tomorrow.
Hello.
So is this Ryu Jin?
Nice to meet you.
I should've greeted you sooner.
Sorry we had to meet the first time like this.
What are you talking about?
Pardon?
I'm sorry.
I don't remember at all.
Do I know him?
Of course.
But why can't I remember?
Since when have you known our family?
I must've aged a lot.
Think back carefully.
My family also knows you very well.
No, I'm sure I don't remember.
Stop it, Jin.
Don't be mean to the doctor.
Forget it.
It's okay.
He could've forgotten.
It's been a long time.
Whether it's 10 or 100 years, I remember everything.
Mr. Ryu Jin.
Now, let's go up.
Where are your manners?
I guess we take after each other.
Call me.
I'll be outside.
No, please go on with your business.
We have some other things to tend to.
Okay.
Pretty, huh?
But she has no brains.
What happened?
I thought you two were going to the hospital.
I don't like that family.
Why?
Something wrong?
They disgust me.
Why are they having a fit over her getting a cold?
She's no paper doll.
They're better than a fake brother.
Yeah.
Better than a fake.
Mr. Mustache is here again.
I told you she's the wrong stone.
Tell me the truth.
You like being her brother, don't you?
Min, try on this wedding dress.
It's in a v-neck.
There's a ribbon here.
It's a high waist style.
This is a silver ring.
There's a small diamond inside.
You picked the clothes yourself for the first time.
I just wanted to wear them.
A rich girl can't help being tacky, either.
I should've followed my dad to the driving range instead.
Think the driving range will help you improve your swing?
Once this job is a done deal,
I'll take you to saipan.
You need to play golf there to get better.
You're taking me, right?
Stop the bullshit.
Just pay my money back.
Where's that lady going?
To the bathroom?
Who'd go to the bathroom with her bags?
Min!
What if he's not her real brother?
Pardon?
And there were some strange people in front of the hospital.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to take a strand of their hair to get checked?
It's for Min's sake.
Min!
Min?
You want to be made a fool of?
Just get her to sign somehow.
There's a surer way.
Just follow me.
They both disappeared.
What's going on?
I'm sure of it.
She left on her own.
If she gets into an accident, then it's a done deal today, right?
If she dies in an accident, it's perfect.
So you'll do it today for sure, right?
Excuse me.
Is there anyone who can show me the way?
Please help me.
There's somewhere I'd really like to go.
Please explain it to me.
Someone please tell me the way.
Where are you headed?
- How kind.
- I'd like to take a taxi.
The world is still generous.
A taxi?
Just go straight this way.
Just come with us.
Thank you.
I think it was sold already.
I'm sorry, there's no more in stock.
There has to be one.
Must be a present for mr.
Oh.
Did she get a nice present from him yesterday?
A rich guy and a host act out the same things.
Here it is.
You've found it.
That's wonderful.
Please wait a moment.
You said it was a gift, right?
Must be for your boyfriend.
My brother's birthday is tomorrow.
It's your birthday?
He'll be so happy.
Never.
This isn't my style, Min.
That's how he'll respond.
Sorry?
That's the kind of person he is.
Tacky.
Come on, you should've done what you were set out to do.
There she is.
Aren't you a man of his word?
You should keep your word.
Let's go have a beer.
We're not following her?
I said let's go.
What's wrong with her now?
What'll you do if you go there?
She can't see anyway.
Are you all right?
Let me take a look.
Someone call an ambulance.
We're at... her mental state is drowsy.
Bp is 180/110.
Heart rate is 52.
The ring... where are you going?
To have a beer.
You're just leaving?
Just go for a date or something.
What about the hospital?
Oh yeah, are things going okay?
Yeah, they are.
How?
Yeah, it's going well.
It's okay.
Micky, when a player picks up a girl, there's one truth out of a hundred of his lies.
That's why women go crazy over the guy.
That's what a real pro is.
Where's the emergency room?
That way.
A brain tumor?
If she had gotten a surgery a few months ago, it wouldn't have gotten this bad.
Have her get the surgery first.
Jin?
Yeah.
Sorry for worrying you.
I went to go buy a present.
I wanted to give you the gift I picked out myself.
But I lost it.
Happy birthday, Jin.
Min, let's get ready to go.
Okay.
Don't make a hasty judgment.
I'll go talk to doctor yang.
And please keep it a secret from Min.
So you mean that she can see?
If the surgery goes well, her vision can possibly be cured.
Jin.
Yes.
Shall we go out?
It's your birthday today.
Okay, let's go.
Where shall we go?
Is there something you'd like to eat?
I got an idea.
Fireflies.
Fireflies?
Yes.
Don't you remember?
Fireflies?
How can she see fireflies when she's blind?
Just show her some flies or beetles.
DNA test result
wow, nothing's changed at all.
There are fireflies everywhere.
- Really?
- Yes.
A lot of them?
Yes, there're some flying over there.
They're pretty, huh?
Of course, they're pretty.
Flying freely?
Yes, they're glittering everywhere.
Jin, why do you always tell me white lies?
What are you talking about?
You can only see the fireflies much later after your birthday.
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?
Your hand is so warm.
So please don't lie to me.
Since I can tell just by listening to your voice.
Min.
There...
I saw one!
There's a firefly!
Got it.
Where did it go?
Jin.
I swear.
It was just here.
Thank you, Jin.
Min, let's go rest upstairs.
Okay.
Mr. Ryu, what happened?
Are you out of your mind?
Go up first.
Min is like a daughter to me.
You can't do this!
You're her brother!
Please leave this house!
Min, listen carefully.
Until we can prove that he's...
I'll prove it myself.
What?
Jin, you sent me letters, right?
Yes.
I have them.
Plus, the pictures.
There're only a few, but he really sent them.
But where could the rest be?
Did someone hide them from me?
Ms. Lee.
Don't act like my mother again.
Min.
Jin?
Stay there.
I'll go to you.
What are you doing?
I'm coming.
I'm okay.
Min.
Min.
I'm over here.
I found you.
I was reading your letter.
You were?
Here.
This picture isn't me.
Really?
Then who is it?
Then is that big shot at the club?
What?
Your letters were all about him.
You said you wanted to be just like him.
The way he dressed, the way he talked.
You said even his voice was attractive.
Min, it was when I wasn't mature.
No, he seemed like a special person.
Not at all.
Hey, you're the one who said it.
He couldn't love anyone.
He couldn't trust love.
And didn't need any of those things.
But you said he was a warm person.
So I also became interested in him.
He seemed just like me.
Ryu Jin
I'm looking for the letters.
I really don't understand Min.
It's obvious he's a fake, but she wouldn't let us kick him out.
Give up?
What are you talking about?
We even dragged doctor Yang into this.
Mr. Oh, you and I both are entitled to this.
If we give up now, there's no money for us.
It's too late to save her now.
She has only six months at the most.
If ms.
Lee and mr.
Oh hadn't objected the surgery, it wouldn't have gotten this bad.
By law, I can't conduct the surgery without the guardian's approval.
I don't know the way.
Someone please help me.
Yeah, she's talking to us.
I must go to the adonis club.
What's with you?
Hey, wait!
Hey, hey
where are you?
She's here.
Really?
You know where it is?
Of course we know where it is.
We'll escort you there.
We're finally here.
Nice and softly.
- Good.
- What are you doing?
I like it this way.
Catch her!
Help me.
Help me!
Help me.
Help me.
What are you doing here?
Get up.
I wish...
I wish you weren't my brother.
Where are we?
Min, remember how I said I'd always protect you, right?
Marriage registration I already got her signature.
She doesn't know what it is anyway.
But do we need to go this far?
How greedy are you to go this far?
Have you lost your conscience?
Doctor Yang told me that you two asked him to do it.
The both of you!
It's me.
Jin's secretary, Kim Tae-Ho.
Where am I?
This is unbelievable.
Sorry?
In front of your own house.
What the hell's he doing?
I already got a call from doctor Yang.
But, you're not any better than we are.
Julian.
Changing your name doesn't change your identity.
You two trying to suck Min dry of her money are the real filth.
I don't care about the money.
Since it'll come to me anyway.
I just hoped that she would die.
What?
Why?
Otherwise, I would die myself.
Why don't you stop now?
Aren't you the one who's trying to kill her for her money?
I'm sorry but you misunderstood me.
I will save Min with my own hands!
What do you know?
Min wanted to die.
Who in this world wants to die?
Are you out of your mind?
She has only six months to live?
Forget it.
I'm going to save her!
Min.
Min, why'd you come outside?
I told you to stay in the car.
What is this?
Will I die if I take this?
What are you talking about?
I told you I was kidding.
Really?
Then I guess I can take it.
Who are you?
Your brother, of course.
Julian?
Min.
I'll eat this pill.
If you don't believe me, put it directly into my mouth.
Okay, I'll trust you.
What the hell did you do?
You let me down.
I really admired julian.
Shit,
I really mistook you.
It's hot!
If you burn yourself, quickly wash it in cold water.
Like this, okay?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's the first meal I've made.
Bon appetite.
I felt bad about always being on the receiving end.
So I wanted to do something for you.
For my brother who returned,
I wanted to show my gratitude.
Mr. Park, please proceed.
Yes.
What is this, Min?
My sincerity.
Although this isn't enough to pay back the love I've received, this is all that I can give you, so please understand.
Mr. Oh, you can have the company.
But I'd like to call off the wedding.
- I'm sorry.
- But... and please make mr.
Park the company's permanent legal advisor.
Min, why all of a sudden?
I didn't take care of you for this.
Please stop it!
You've got what you wanted!
Mr. Oh, didn't you want the company?
Ms. Lee, you got the money you wanted.
Then it's over.
Of course, you have to wait a bit more if I really die.
I've graciously heard what you all had to say here last night.
So the show is now over.
When you're through with your meal, please leave this house.
Why aren't you saying anything to him?
I've asked him to leave.
Why aren't you blaming him like you're blaming us?
Since he's my brother.
If he's your brother, you should ask him to stay.
We can't be together.
Yes, he's said a bigger lie than... because of love.
Because
I love him.
It was very delicious.
Thank you for this.
Leave quietly, as if nothing had happened.
So that I can think that the memories with you were all just a dream.
Okay.
Ms. Lee.
Thanks for all you've done.
Julian.
Julian.
Oh, julian.
He's such a legend.
Don't know how much, but i heard he got a huge amount.
And that he's still alive without paying back that mustache guy.
He's become the talk of the town.
But the funniest thing is... that story of his sister giving him the ring was a big hit.
Chics are so touched by it they flock to him everyday, pouring their money on him for his sister's medical bills.
Heard he's got his money stashed away in a safe.
But why hasn't he paid back the 2.87 million dollars.
Does he not have enough?
But i don't think so.
Aren't you sick of that ring?
Julian is really amazing.
He's not amazing, he's evil.
There's no change in the schedule for the surgery tomorrow I presume.
For convenience, I moved her into a house near the hospital.
There's no need to worry.
Yes, alright.
Then I'll see you at the hospital tomorrow.
There will be no problem.
Since I took care of everything.
But why are you so hasty?
Are you nervous?
No.
The surgery could take longer than you think.
I'll do my best, but... please make it a success.
I beg you.
Please sign here.
When she wakes up, please give her this.
The person who signed was Jin, wasn't it?
Well...
I was right.
You see, there are things I can see that can't be seen.
Actually, it was him who helped prepare everything for the surgery.
He also returned the money.
He also left a letter to give you after the surgery.
Where is he?
I want to go to him.
I had to bid the last farewell.
You're an amazing person.
Sorry about before.
I mistook you again.
I've heard of that before.
Take me in again and let me go with you.
Where are you going?
Where shall I go?
To saipan?
Saipan, yes!
You can play some great golf there.
But what about that girl?
Don't know.
She's probably getting operated on.
Can you please remove your sunglass?
Have a nice trip.
Kwang-Su
the game's all over anyway.
Go ahead and answer it.
It's me.
I'm with her here at the club.
Actually, today's the surgery.
But he left a letter for me.
In his awkward braille letter.
What does it say?
It said he wanted me to see him, after my surgery.
Wherever I may be, he promised to find me.
You could've met him after your surgery.
If I fall and happen to die,
I would never see him again.
There is something I want to hear.
Do you like him that much?
Yes.
Min!
I'm here!
Step aside.
Get out of my way.
Please.
I told you all you needed to do was pay back the 2.87 million dollars.
Money?
I'll give you the money.
Give me more time.
You look really bad.
It was dangerous to love from the beginning.
Min.
Min.
Please stop.
Let me meet her one last time.
I need to tell her something.
Let me see Min just once.
Oh, it's so touching.
Flithy playboy, Julian, could change like this... the power of love is amazing.
That's all for today.
What a waste.
Julian has found love finally, but now it's too late.
Since there's nothing more important than money.
You said you wanted to hear something from him?
He's got some time left to live.
Excuse me!
My brother.
- Please help.
- Min.
Jin.
Why are you so cold?
Min.
After meeting you,
I learned that coffee and cigarettes must be together.
Your hands are usually warm.
And that cigarettes must be with a lighter.
I learned that lighters must be on top of a desk.
If I was sitting at a desk now, while smoking a cigarette and drinking coffee,
as if I'm taking you in, pushing down the smoke deep in my chest,
I could've written down letter by letter that I love you.
They're usually warm.
I love you.
Brother!
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I could've written it 1000 times and shown it to you.
Then what would you have said?
You can think of whatever I say as a lie.
Because I'm just adding one more to the countless lies I said to you.
If it was fate to meet you, then could you come to where I am?
I will wait for you.
Until the day you come to me, even if you never come, I will wait for you.
Who are you?
Don't lie to me.
Because... because...
I can tell just by listening to your voice.
It's warm.
How old is she?
I heard she's twenty.
I heard she's inheriting everything.
Of course, she's the only family that's left.
I heard she's looking for her brother.
Then her brother gets the inheritance, too?
There are things that I see which can't be seen.
The people around me.
Their eyes on me are cold.
Colder than the snow.
The whole world is cold like this.
Where am I?
What hope do I have to live on?
I don't need anything.
Love me not

hello, Julian.
- Give me a cigarette.
- Yeah.
How've you been?
Been great.
Where's Ryu Jin?
He's in the car.
Where's my car?
Well, it got smashed.
It got into an accident.
I swear I didn't do it.
It was Jin.
Well, it's been a few days.
At that intersection by the club.
Jin took the car out.
He dodged an approaching car.
But that crazy bastard crossed the median.
So he tried to avoid it, but wham.
Oh that?
That's Ryu Jin.
I told you he was in the car.
People get small like that after they die.
Julian?
Yes, it's me.
- How come i can't reach you?
- I was out of the country.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- How have you been?
- Fine, and you?
I'm fine as always.
- You missed me, didn't you?
- Of course.
What are you doing today?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you'd go to jail.
Forget it.
He said he was going to take care of everything.
I didn't do it.
Well, all women are the same.
I'll make the lou for six months.
Thanks for this.
Don't do this.
Julian.
Don't go.
You know how much I love you.
I don't need love.
Is this Ryu Jin's cell phone?
It's mine now.
Let's go to the club.
I got lots of money!
Julian!
- Julian!
- Julian!
Where've you been?
So handsome.
Julian, look at me.
I love you everyone.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Julian, julian.
My club's number one host, julian.
You've been through a lot.
But you know what?
I found out about it all while you were in prison.
So you wanted to go independent after swindling money from rich girls?
You know that bad rumors get around in this town.
Shut up!
Don't try to play games with me.
Look at me straight in the eyes.
Even your wonderful piece down there is through now.
What a cool breeze.
But i smell a woman's groin in the wind.
Shit, this isn't right.
People have misunderstood one thing about me.
A guy like me can never fall.
You got that right!
The king of adonis club will never fall.
So how about we go independent now as you planned.
Your fan club will be waiting in line all across the country.
I'll do my best to help.
Shit!
You bastard.
You crazy bastard!
Get out of the truck!
You're a real wisecrack.
Get out right now.
- Long time no see.
- You're a really funny guy, with that big car of yours.
Hey!
You!
You two know each other?
Damn it!
What the hell is this?
Huh?
Do you know how to drive?
This is crazy.
You look really beat.
Yes, I sure am.
I have a problem.
I know.
I heard you went straight to the club.
That's why I came to you right away.
You know?
Really?
Please help me out.
Let's see.
Total, 2.87 million dollars.
Plus, the 6-month interest on the loan.
Sorry.
One month.
This clock is ticking on your behalf.
The world is unpredictable.
Fun, isn't it?
Hey!
Wait.
Wait.
2.87 million dollars in one month?
Come on.
That's crazy!
Then, shall we make it three days?
When you were a big shot, you were the one who demanded 500,000 dollars in three days.
So you should know the rules.
You should've lived with modesty.
And don't forget the one who made you what you are.
It's Julian.
Call me at this number.
Shit.
Why'd you bring that bastard here?
Ji-Hyae!
- You've got no manners.
- Why the fuck are you cursing?
Go away!
- Yes, it's Julian.
- Where do you think you are?
No way, so what happened?
So there was no other choice.
In that tiny basement,
I spent that winter with my insane alcoholic father.
What a rotten mother.
How could she have abandoned you?
Don't know.
He looked at me... with a very sad face one day.
And then he caressed his hand on my face.
I really hated it.
His hand was damp and smelled strange.
And the moment he lit the cigarette in his mouth,
he burned.
In flames.
He burned in front of my eyes.
Half of his body was burned to a crisp.
That's nonsense.
It's a lie again, right?
Of course it's a lie.
Come on.
It was true?
Come here,
I'll hug you.
No, I have a meeting at three.
Here you are.
You're such a lovely woman.
Six months for the lou?
I told you, it's my present.
Money, money.
What?
Only one grand?
What bad manners.
It's enough for just a pair of shoes.
- Dom perignon vintage, please.
- Yes.
Who keeps calling a hundred times a day?
One of Ryu Jin's clients, I bet.
Listen to the message.
There's probably no password.
You know the saying, your girl is my girl, and my girl is yours.
Or... regulars follow wherever the famous chef goes.
How much?
My name is Park Ki-Young.
Your father's lawyer.
What does it say?
You can tell if they're rich...
I'm calling you to talk about your inheritance.
Your father has passed away.
I feel really bad for the guy.
He said he went through a lot when he left home after his parents divorced.
His parents are all dead and now their son.
Only thing left is the money.
Whether you're rich or a host, you're all the same when you die.
Don't you agree?
Oh yeah, he said once that he's got a younger sister.
Then she'll get all that money.
This is his younger sister?
Yeah, she's twenty.
Twenty.
He wrote letters to her everyday.
Everyday?
Yes, everyday.
Crazy bastard.
- Play this.
- Okay.
Let's go at least.
We'll hand over the ashes, and offer our grievances.
Tell them how sorry we are and shed some tears.
That way we'll get compensated with some money.
He's rich.
- Jin, what do you want?
- Rice.
Anything.
Nothing hard about it.
We're the only ones who can give this to Jin's family.
Let's go.
What if you can't pay him back in a month?
He'll kill me.
What?
Then he won't get his money.
I don't want to die, that's why I pay him back.
Damn it, it's raining.
It's pouring.
- What a house.
- Hop out.
Look at that house.
It's a huge mansion.
What is your name?
Micky.
Cute and fun Micky.
Not that, your real name.
Kim Tae-Ho?
Yes, Tae-Ho.
From now on, forget about Julian and Micky.
You're Kim Tae-Ho, Ryu Jin's secretary.
What?
There's also a woman in that house.
Hold on.
- Who is it?
- Ryu Jin.
You're going to impersonate him?
You're no Ryu Jin.
I'm not going.
I'm scared.
You'll go to jail again if you get caught.
Trying to take me to jail with you?
I'm scared.
Thank you for coming.
I'm Park Ki-Yong, the one who called you.
She's been taking care of this house for 15 years.
This is ms.
Lee.
And mr.
Oh here has been running your father's company after his death.
Pleased to meet you.
This is my secretary, Kim Tae-Ho.
And my sister?
- Mr. Park.
- I know it's a formality, but we need to make sure about your background, so... so?
Check my identification?
Mother loved the clock on that wall.
But it's not here anymore.
It used to hang there.
That... mother picked a picture herself, and hung it here.
It's all been changed.
Was it that bastard again?
I didn't come here for this.
So is that why the apple tree in the yard was thrown away?
There was such a thing?
The apple tree that mother raised!
We came to this house after you and your mother had left... it was there!
Mother and I raised that tree ourselves!
Where's Min?
Huh?
Min.
Min!
Who are you to yell in here?
Min, it's me, your brother.
Don't let any strangers into my house.
Min, it's raining outside!
My sister can't see?
Actually, i was going to tell you.
Min, wait!
Min, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
Min!
It's been so long.
My only image of you as a kid... jin!
Min!
I'm sorry, min.
From now on, I will... go back!
You and mom died 16 years ago.
I've never once forgotten about you.
You know that.
It was all in the letters.
Letters?
There were letters?
No, we didn't receive any letters.
Mr. Park.
Compensate him and send him away.
In your father's will, your brother is also entitled to the inheritance.
You must sign first for the inheritance
- to be settled.
- I told you he's dead!
Why do I need to sign for a dead person?
Okay, you take care of it.
Because I don't need that money.
Then get out of here right now.
Min!
We're the only two left.
I can't leave you alone and go.
If you smile... if you smile like you once did, then I'll leave.
Until then,
I want to be with you.
Now are you satisfied?
Leave.
Min, my love for you...
I don't need love.
Cerebral thrombosis?
She fell sick when she was 13, and totally lost her sight at 15.
What did that father of ours do at the time?
He did the best he could for Min.
He took her to all the famous hospitals.
He even took her overseas many times.
Although she was in a critical state, she survived thanks to him.
You'll find it comfortable for your stay here.
I'll clean up the room on the third floor.
You can move your belongings in there.
Don't worry about me.
I have to go overseas soon for an important business.
This is the room.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
- Have a good rest.
- Yeah.
I was scared out of my wits.
We would've been dead if it wasn't for this ball.
That girl's got a serious temper.
She takes after her brother.
Is your face alright?
Go pack my stuff and bring them here.
There's a fine for every inch ripped even on a pool table.
So imagine scratching Julian's face.
It's a crime.
So my life is in her hands.
He's different from what I had imagined.
As you know, people are influenced by the environment they're raised in.
I'm telling you, it was unreal.
I could feel his mastery.
That teary-eyed acting of his.
I should've recorded that stuff and study it.
But i didn't bring the camera.
Hey!
Do it right.
You missed the nail.
I'm sorry.
You can't get anything right.
You know exactly what an inheritance is?
Study that instead.
Think you'll get the job done?
You two are hopeless anyway.
A ferrari.
Nice.
Delicious.
Thank you for the meal.
There's still some left.
It's bad manners not to finish.
Min usually doesn't eat much.
Then put your dishes away.
- Usually, I...
- ms.
Lee, I wasn't talking to you.
Min!
It's etiquette to take your dishes at least.
Saw that?
A blind person can't do this.
Ryu Min!
Please stop.
There are many people who can do this even though they can't see.
Min!
I'll help you.
Let's go downstairs.
I get scared if you suddenly grab me!
You do?
Sorry, i didn't know.
But... but ms.
Lee can't always be by your side.
So let's put in an effort together so that you can do things yourself.
Is that what you wanted to say?
Don't worry about trivial stuff like that.
Money can handle everything.
I feel the same way.
Min.
Can you hear me?
The most important thing in the world is that can't be bought with money.
Don't weigh money and your heart on the same scale.
Understand?
Min gets scared when many people are around.
She particularly dislikes outsiders coming here.
If something happens, how will you... who did this?
I did not permit this!
Min, shall we play, too?
Ms. Lee.
Yes, I'm here, Min.
Send everyone out.
Send them out this instant!
You're being too mean to the kids.
Who cares?
If I don't like it, that's it.
Yeah?
Then you leave.
Don't lock yourself in, just because you can't see.
Min... don't interfere.
This is a family matter.
Be careful on your way out.
Ms. Lee, what's the best way to grab on to a blind person?
Here, grab on to this.
I thought you've never been outside alone.
I'll help you.
Careful, careful.
Even the smell of the grass is nice.
All I smell is cigarette smoke.
Fine.
I know that you had a hard life.
But I'm here now.
There's only the two of us.
Us two have to live together.
So can't you open your heart a bit?
Oh yeah, you said money is all you need?
Sure you do.
But you think the world will be easy on a blind girl?
Never.
It doesn't work that way.
Min.
I'll take care of everything from now on.
Just trust me and follow me.
Let's make a new start.
I know how you feel.
I'll never leave you.
- You know how I feel?
- Let me finish!
How do you know how I feel?
Know how it feels to gradually lose your sight?
- Min!
- Let go!
Know how it feels to lose the memories you want to cherish?
It would've been better if I was just born blind.
I want you to remember exactly how cruel you've been to me.
I was doing well forgetting.
But now, you're making me remember everything.
Will the stone turn into a lump of gold?
I think you've picked up the wrong stone.
Jin.
Kill me.
Tae-Ho,
I got a favor to ask.
Are you sure?
Don't ask.
I ordered it from a trustworthy website.
But aren't you going overboard?
Who'd give a deadly pill to someone as a gift?
But it does seem possible.
People, you see, don't die so easily.
So what does this cane have to do with it?
A present for my sister.
A mascot of fortune?
What?
A gift?
Min, what are you going to do today?
There are things that you see which can't be seen.
Want to go with me?
Anyway, what's in this?
Oh, that?
Drugs.
Drugs?
Drugs that will make you die.
I thought you wanted to die.
Don't be scared.
It was a joke.
If you say you're going to die again, you'll get a beating, okay?
It'll relieve all your stress!
Come this way!
Grab the trigger and hold the gun like this.
And then shoot.
I'll aim for you and you just shoot, okay?
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Shoot again.
It was close.
What a great couple!
Let me take your picture.
I'll capture a wonderful memory.
Min, wait here.
I'll be right back.
What are you doing?
You were doing great.
She'll hate you again.
Sadness follows happiness.
When it comes, it's very painful.
Right?
You feel like dying.
Min!
Sorry, I got caught up on my way.
It's okay.
Since you promised to protect me anyway.
In your awkward braille letter.
Show me something fun again.
A witch appeared.
The witch tries to kill the princess, but the prince appears.
That sound's from somewhere else.
I know.
Just get the explanation right.
But that witch is really ugly.
Very ugly.
And her cheeks are loose.
Stay still, let me see your face.
It's different from the face i had imagined.
Yes, her temperature has gone down.
Doctor, I did as you told me.
Yes.
I understand.
Good-bye.
Will she be alright?
It's nothing serious, but she'll need to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Then I'll send the car to her first thing in the morning.
Mr. Oh, you seem to look after Min very much.
I'm sorry, I haven't told you yet.
They'll get married soon.
Why haven't you told me before?
I almost mistook them.
It's getting late.
You should get going.
I'll take her to the hospital tomorrow.
Hello.
So is this Ryu Jin?
Nice to meet you.
I should've greeted you sooner.
Sorry we had to meet the first time like this.
What are you talking about?
Pardon?
I'm sorry.
I don't remember at all.
Do I know him?
Of course.
But why can't I remember?
Since when have you known our family?
I must've aged a lot.
Think back carefully.
My family also knows you very well.
No, I'm sure I don't remember.
Stop it, Jin.
Don't be mean to the doctor.
Forget it.
It's okay.
He could've forgotten.
It's been a long time.
Whether it's 10 or 100 years, I remember everything.
Mr. Ryu Jin.
Now, let's go up.
Where are your manners?
I guess we take after each other.
Call me.
I'll be outside.
No, please go on with your business.
We have some other things to tend to.
Okay.
Pretty, huh?
But she has no brains.
What happened?
I thought you two were going to the hospital.
I don't like that family.
Why?
Something wrong?
They disgust me.
Why are they having a fit over her getting a cold?
She's no paper doll.
They're better than a fake brother.
Yeah.
Better than a fake.
Mr. Mustache is here again.
I told you she's the wrong stone.
Tell me the truth.
You like being her brother, don't you?
Min, try on this wedding dress.
It's in a v-neck.
There's a ribbon here.
It's a high waist style.
This is a silver ring.
There's a small diamond inside.
You picked the clothes yourself for the first time.
I just wanted to wear them.
A rich girl can't help being tacky, either.
I should've followed my dad to the driving range instead.
Think the driving range will help you improve your swing?
Once this job is a done deal,
I'll take you to saipan.
You need to play golf there to get better.
You're taking me, right?
Stop the bullshit.
Just pay my money back.
Where's that lady going?
To the bathroom?
Who'd go to the bathroom with her bags?
Min!
What if he's not her real brother?
Pardon?
And there were some strange people in front of the hospital.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to take a strand of their hair to get checked?
It's for Min's sake.
Min!
Min?
You want to be made a fool of?
Just get her to sign somehow.
There's a surer way.
Just follow me.
They both disappeared.
What's going on?
I'm sure of it.
She left on her own.
If she gets into an accident, then it's a done deal today, right?
If she dies in an accident, it's perfect.
So you'll do it today for sure, right?
Excuse me.
Is there anyone who can show me the way?
Please help me.
There's somewhere I'd really like to go.
Please explain it to me.
Someone please tell me the way.
Where are you headed?
- How kind.
- I'd like to take a taxi.
The world is still generous.
A taxi?
Just go straight this way.
Just come with us.
Thank you.
I think it was sold already.
I'm sorry, there's no more in stock.
There has to be one.
Must be a present for mr.
Oh.
Did she get a nice present from him yesterday?
A rich guy and a host act out the same things.
Here it is.
You've found it.
That's wonderful.
Please wait a moment.
You said it was a gift, right?
Must be for your boyfriend.
My brother's birthday is tomorrow.
It's your birthday?
He'll be so happy.
Never.
This isn't my style, Min.
That's how he'll respond.
Sorry?
That's the kind of person he is.
Tacky.
Come on, you should've done what you were set out to do.
There she is.
Aren't you a man of his word?
You should keep your word.
Let's go have a beer.
We're not following her?
I said let's go.
What's wrong with her now?
What'll you do if you go there?
She can't see anyway.
Are you all right?
Let me take a look.
Someone call an ambulance.
We're at... her mental state is drowsy.
Bp is 180/110.
Heart rate is 52.
The ring... where are you going?
To have a beer.
You're just leaving?
Just go for a date or something.
What about the hospital?
Oh yeah, are things going okay?
Yeah, they are.
How?
Yeah, it's going well.
It's okay.
Micky, when a player picks up a girl, there's one truth out of a hundred of his lies.
That's why women go crazy over the guy.
That's what a real pro is.
Where's the emergency room?
That way.
A brain tumor?
If she had gotten a surgery a few months ago, it wouldn't have gotten this bad.
Have her get the surgery first.
Jin?
Yeah.
Sorry for worrying you.
I went to go buy a present.
I wanted to give you the gift I picked out myself.
But I lost it.
Happy birthday, Jin.
Min, let's get ready to go.
Okay.
Don't make a hasty judgment.
I'll go talk to doctor yang.
And please keep it a secret from Min.
So you mean that she can see?
If the surgery goes well, her vision can possibly be cured.
Jin.
Yes.
Shall we go out?
It's your birthday today.
Okay, let's go.
Where shall we go?
Is there something you'd like to eat?
I got an idea.
Fireflies.
Fireflies?
Yes.
Don't you remember?
Fireflies?
How can she see fireflies when she's blind?
Just show her some flies or beetles.
DNA test result
wow, nothing's changed at all.
There are fireflies everywhere.
- Really?
- Yes.
A lot of them?
Yes, there're some flying over there.
They're pretty, huh?
Of course, they're pretty.
Flying freely?
Yes, they're glittering everywhere.
Jin, why do you always tell me white lies?
What are you talking about?
You can only see the fireflies much later after your birthday.
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?
Your hand is so warm.
So please don't lie to me.
Since I can tell just by listening to your voice.
Min.
There...
I saw one!
There's a firefly!
Got it.
Where did it go?
Jin.
I swear.
It was just here.
Thank you, Jin.
Min, let's go rest upstairs.
Okay.
Mr. Ryu, what happened?
Are you out of your mind?
Go up first.
Min is like a daughter to me.
You can't do this!
You're her brother!
Please leave this house!
Min, listen carefully.
Until we can prove that he's...
I'll prove it myself.
What?
Jin, you sent me letters, right?
Yes.
I have them.
Plus, the pictures.
There're only a few, but he really sent them.
But where could the rest be?
Did someone hide them from me?
Ms. Lee.
Don't act like my mother again.
Min.
Jin?
Stay there.
I'll go to you.
What are you doing?
I'm coming.
I'm okay.
Min.
Min.
I'm over here.
I found you.
I was reading your letter.
You were?
Here.
This picture isn't me.
Really?
Then who is it?
Then is that big shot at the club?
What?
Your letters were all about him.
You said you wanted to be just like him.
The way he dressed, the way he talked.
You said even his voice was attractive.
Min, it was when I wasn't mature.
No, he seemed like a special person.
Not at all.
Hey, you're the one who said it.
He couldn't love anyone.
He couldn't trust love.
And didn't need any of those things.
But you said he was a warm person.
So I also became interested in him.
He seemed just like me.
Ryu Jin
I'm looking for the letters.
I really don't understand Min.
It's obvious he's a fake, but she wouldn't let us kick him out.
Give up?
What are you talking about?
We even dragged doctor Yang into this.
Mr. Oh, you and I both are entitled to this.
If we give up now, there's no money for us.
It's too late to save her now.
She has only six months at the most.
If ms.
Lee and mr.
Oh hadn't objected the surgery, it wouldn't have gotten this bad.
By law, I can't conduct the surgery without the guardian's approval.
I don't know the way.
Someone please help me.
Yeah, she's talking to us.
I must go to the adonis club.
What's with you?
Hey, wait!
Hey, hey
where are you?
She's here.
Really?
You know where it is?
Of course we know where it is.
We'll escort you there.
We're finally here.
Nice and softly.
- Good.
- What are you doing?
I like it this way.
Catch her!
Help me.
Help me!
Help me.
Help me.
What are you doing here?
Get up.
I wish...
I wish you weren't my brother.
Where are we?
Min, remember how I said I'd always protect you, right?
Marriage registration I already got her signature.
She doesn't know what it is anyway.
But do we need to go this far?
How greedy are you to go this far?
Have you lost your conscience?
Doctor Yang told me that you two asked him to do it.
The both of you!
It's me.
Jin's secretary, Kim Tae-Ho.
Where am I?
This is unbelievable.
Sorry?
In front of your own house.
What the hell's he doing?
I already got a call from doctor Yang.
But, you're not any better than we are.
Julian.
Changing your name doesn't change your identity.
You two trying to suck Min dry of her money are the real filth.
I don't care about the money.
Since it'll come to me anyway.
I just hoped that she would die.
What?
Why?
Otherwise, I would die myself.
Why don't you stop now?
Aren't you the one who's trying to kill her for her money?
I'm sorry but you misunderstood me.
I will save Min with my own hands!
What do you know?
Min wanted to die.
Who in this world wants to die?
Are you out of your mind?
She has only six months to live?
Forget it.
I'm going to save her!
Min.
Min, why'd you come outside?
I told you to stay in the car.
What is this?
Will I die if I take this?
What are you talking about?
I told you I was kidding.
Really?
Then I guess I can take it.
Who are you?
Your brother, of course.
Julian?
Min.
I'll eat this pill.
If you don't believe me, put it directly into my mouth.
Okay, I'll trust you.
What the hell did you do?
You let me down.
I really admired julian.
Shit,
I really mistook you.
It's hot!
If you burn yourself, quickly wash it in cold water.
Like this, okay?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's the first meal I've made.
Bon appetite.
I felt bad about always being on the receiving end.
So I wanted to do something for you.
For my brother who returned,
I wanted to show my gratitude.
Mr. Park, please proceed.
Yes.
What is this, Min?
My sincerity.
Although this isn't enough to pay back the love I've received, this is all that I can give you, so please understand.
Mr. Oh, you can have the company.
But I'd like to call off the wedding.
- I'm sorry.
- But... and please make mr.
Park the company's permanent legal advisor.
Min, why all of a sudden?
I didn't take care of you for this.
Please stop it!
You've got what you wanted!
Mr. Oh, didn't you want the company?
Ms. Lee, you got the money you wanted.
Then it's over.
Of course, you have to wait a bit more if I really die.
I've graciously heard what you all had to say here last night.
So the show is now over.
When you're through with your meal, please leave this house.
Why aren't you saying anything to him?
I've asked him to leave.
Why aren't you blaming him like you're blaming us?
Since he's my brother.
If he's your brother, you should ask him to stay.
We can't be together.
Yes, he's said a bigger lie than... because of love.
Because
I love him.
It was very delicious.
Thank you for this.
Leave quietly, as if nothing had happened.
So that I can think that the memories with you were all just a dream.
Okay.
Ms. Lee.
Thanks for all you've done.
Julian.
Julian.
Oh, julian.
He's such a legend.
Don't know how much, but i heard he got a huge amount.
And that he's still alive without paying back that mustache guy.
He's become the talk of the town.
But the funniest thing is... that story of his sister giving him the ring was a big hit.
Chics are so touched by it they flock to him everyday, pouring their money on him for his sister's medical bills.
Heard he's got his money stashed away in a safe.
But why hasn't he paid back the 2.87 million dollars.
Does he not have enough?
But i don't think so.
Aren't you sick of that ring?
Julian is really amazing.
He's not amazing, he's evil.
There's no change in the schedule for the surgery tomorrow I presume.
For convenience, I moved her into a house near the hospital.
There's no need to worry.
Yes, alright.
Then I'll see you at the hospital tomorrow.
There will be no problem.
Since I took care of everything.
But why are you so hasty?
Are you nervous?
No.
The surgery could take longer than you think.
I'll do my best, but... please make it a success.
I beg you.
Please sign here.
When she wakes up, please give her this.
The person who signed was Jin, wasn't it?
Well...
I was right.
You see, there are things I can see that can't be seen.
Actually, it was him who helped prepare everything for the surgery.
He also returned the money.
He also left a letter to give you after the surgery.
Where is he?
I want to go to him.
I had to bid the last farewell.
You're an amazing person.
Sorry about before.
I mistook you again.
I've heard of that before.
Take me in again and let me go with you.
Where are you going?
Where shall I go?
To saipan?
Saipan, yes!
You can play some great golf there.
But what about that girl?
Don't know.
She's probably getting operated on.
Can you please remove your sunglass?
Have a nice trip.
Kwang-Su
the game's all over anyway.
Go ahead and answer it.
It's me.
I'm with her here at the club.
Actually, today's the surgery.
But he left a letter for me.
In his awkward braille letter.
What does it say?
It said he wanted me to see him, after my surgery.
Wherever I may be, he promised to find me.
You could've met him after your surgery.
If I fall and happen to die,
I would never see him again.
There is something I want to hear.
Do you like him that much?
Yes.
Min!
I'm here!
Step aside.
Get out of my way.
Please.
I told you all you needed to do was pay back the 2.87 million dollars.
Money?
I'll give you the money.
Give me more time.
You look really bad.
It was dangerous to love from the beginning.
Min.
Min.
Please stop.
Let me meet her one last time.
I need to tell her something.
Let me see Min just once.
Oh, it's so touching.
Flithy playboy, Julian, could change like this... the power of love is amazing.
That's all for today.
What a waste.
Julian has found love finally, but now it's too late.
Since there's nothing more important than money.
You said you wanted to hear something from him?
He's got some time left to live.
Excuse me!
My brother.
- Please help.
- Min.
Jin.
Why are you so cold?
Min.
After meeting you,
I learned that coffee and cigarettes must be together.
Your hands are usually warm.
And that cigarettes must be with a lighter.
I learned that lighters must be on top of a desk.
If I was sitting at a desk now, while smoking a cigarette and drinking coffee,
as if I'm taking you in, pushing down the smoke deep in my chest,
I could've written down letter by letter that I love you.
They're usually warm.
I love you.
Brother!
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I could've written it 1000 times and shown it to you.
Then what would you have said?
You can think of whatever I say as a lie.
Because I'm just adding one more to the countless lies I said to you.
If it was fate to meet you, then could you come to where I am?
I will wait for you.
Until the day you come to me, even if you never come, I will wait for you.
Who are you?
Don't lie to me.
Because... because...
I can tell just by listening to your voice.
It's warm.
I am a genius.
I am the greatest artist of the 20th century.
My name is Pablo Picasso.
I pretty much invented modern art.
And I do weird, abstract paintings even though I can paint totally realistic, if I wanted to.
Also, even though I'm super short and bald I am able to have sex with any beautiful woman I want just because I'm so great.
Come here.
Look.
- Pretty good.
- Thanks.
Some day, if you get famous, this can be worth a lot of money.
You're wasting your time, Jerome.
You gotta set your sights on a more realistic girl.
Shit, here comes Stoob.
Hey, pencil-prick, thanks for helping me with that poster for Erikson's class.
- He said I was a natural artist.
- A natural scam artist.
Got that right, queer-bait.
What's this?
- Are you jacking off in school now?
- It's a college brochure, you moron.
What college has a naked chick for a teacher?
She's an art model, you stupid ape.
Hey.
You're all right, Platz.
I don't know, Jerome.
It just seems a little too good to be true.
Don't you think?
Fucking shit!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's based on the whole thing with the campus murder, but...
Hell no, it ain't no boring-ass documentary.
Look, forget that shit, okay?
Yeah, fucking A, there's gonna be tons of action, are you kidding me?
- You're an art major?
- Yeah.
Drawing and painting.
- What are you guys?
- I'm fashion.
He's film, I guess.
Are you for real?
You're shitting me, right?
- Well, yeah.
- God, this is so depressing.
- Why, what's wrong?
- I just really, really miss my girlfriend.
One hundred percent.
Yeah, you won't be sorry.
I love you too, Grandpa.
Yes!
Yes!
I'm so fucking pumped!
- I'm Vince.
- Hi.
Jerome.
How are you?
- What's your name again?
- Matthew.
God, I'm so fucking jazzed.
I get to make my movie.
That's fantastic.
- You guys freshmen?
- Yeah.
- You a sophomore?
- Junior.
It's all right.
You listen to me, you'll be okay.
Why do you still live in the dorm?
A lot of juniors still live in the dorm.
What's wrong with that?
That guy's some hot shit sculpture major.
I have never seen so many beautiful girls.
This is nothing.
Dude, you should've seen last year's crop.
Enrollment's way off since the murders.
- What murders?
- You're shitting me, right?
I heard about it.
Somebody killed a guy on campus, or whatever.
Yeah.
Three people in the neighborhood since March.
You're fucking with me.
You've never heard about the Strathmore Strangler?
He killed a guy, like, 10 days ago.
- Are you from out of state?
- The suburbs.
Then you have no excuse.
What about Richard Natwick?
- Jesus.
- Sorry, I don't really follow the news.
Okay, I'm gonna give you the story...
You gotta pay attention.
Because this story is huge.
This is, like, national news, man.
I'm listening.
Just after the first murder, there's this guy, Richard Natwick.
He's, like, some second-year painting major.
Does these stupid-ass word paintings.
He has a show at the student center.
Cops send some guys to check it out.
But they're not used to this kind of artsy bullshit, right?
- Fucking...
- Cut your shit.
Get used to being bent over, prick.
So then a couple of professors freak out.
And before you know it, he's like a fucking martyr.
Art is not a crime!
Art is not a crime!
Of course, it turns out he's completely innocent.
And the cops have to totally eat shit.
- So, what happened to him?
- He had his 15 minutes of fame.
Then he got hurt real bad in some crazy-ass performance art thing.
Okay hit the juice.
Anyway, you gotta read my script.
I mean, it's all in there.
It's totally huge.
So, what, you don't get the paper in the suburbs?
I mean, for all they know, the killer could be from the suburbs.
Those cops, they don't know shit.
So, what, you're a drawing major?
Yeah.
Drawing and painting.
That's awesome.
I hear you guys get to see tons of naked vagina.
Okay, Leslie.
Time to work your magic.
First pose, people.
We're gonna hit the ground running.
Okay, first pose.
I don't have any particular wisdom to impart to you people, except this:
These four words:
Don't have unrealistic expectations.
If you wanna make money, better drop out right now.
Go to banking school or website school.
Anywhere but art school.
And remember, only one out of 100 of you will ever make a living as an artist.
Hello?
Yes.
Ah, Lorenzo.
No.
Absolutely, yes...
Sandy, can I get a break up here?
Take a break.
Five minutes.
Are you kidding?
I would absolutely love to have you look at it.
No, because I feel like I've really turned a corner with this latest series.
In January?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sure I could.
I mean, I don't think my plate is completely full.
Well, I'd be happy...
No, of course not.
Hi.
- Really pretty, what you're doing.
- I gotta go.
Jesus.
Why are the people in these freshman classes exactly the same every year?
Look.
You got the vegan holy man.
The boring blowhard.
- The angry lesbian.
- Professor?
Professor?
Professor?
And here, you got kiss-ass.
I wanted to tell you that I looked up some of your paintings on the Internet.
- I thought they were really terrific.
- You get an "A" for the class.
And Mom.
I feel that I am finally about to ripen.
Artistically.
Mom's youngest just left the nest so she's ready to explore her creative side.
How do you know all this stuff?
Because I'm a living cliché just like the rest of these guys.
I'm the guy who keeps dropping out and changing majors because he's afraid he really sucks at everything.
So who am I?
I don't know.
I haven't figured you out yet.
Jesus.
Who's the weirdo?
Professor?
Professor?
Professor Okamura?
What is your attendance policy for this class?
I don't care if you come to class or not.
This is ready for the kiln.
Let me see if I got this right:
You're the guy that never got laid in high school.
So you came here to try to bone your way through an endless lineup of art skanks.
Not exactly.
I mean, I really do wanna be an artist.
A great artist, you know, if possible.
Which enables you to bone your way through a lineup of art skanks.
So why wait, man?
Art school's like a pussy buffet.
I don't want just any girl.
All right.
There she is.
There is the beautiful beatnik art chick of your dreams.
- Yeah, so?
- So ask her to borrow something.
It's the easiest thing in the world.
Want me to teach you?
Daddy will bring you there.
- Jesus...
- Come on.
Hi...
Do you think I could borrow your pencil?
Why?
- What for?
- Doesn't matter, it was a stupid idea.
Oh, my God.
You have the most beautiful eyes.
You have to let me take a picture of them.
Okay.
How about pizza?
Do you wanna go get pizza?
The only trouble with that is all those beatnik chicks are totally insane.
Look, what you really want is a nice, innocent, suburban girl.
Some freshman chick who hasn't been corrupted yet.
Stay out of that cave, Koala Bear.
There's snakes and bats.
Don't be silly, Pepper.
I'm not afraid of a little snake.
You know, come to think of it, they're all insane.
Just find yourself some nympho slut and get it over with.
Excuse me.
Can you help me get this off?
I want you to know, I definitely don't have AIDS.
I've been tested, like, 40 times, so I know it for a fact.
Keep the fucking kid quiet, you motherfucking asshole!
It's just my old man.
Are you serious?
You've never been laid before?
It just hasn't worked out yet.
I have very high standards.
Man, I gotta take you out whore-busting some night.
We gotta remedy this situation before it gets any worse.
Maybe you have issues that make it difficult to feel comfortable with your own sexuality.
Could be, I guess.
You guys know what whore-busting is, right?
You leave the money on the dresser, fuck the whore and go to sleep.
You wake up, not only is your money still there, but she's left you a tip.
It's the fucking greatest deal ever, man.
Crackheads aren't so good.
Their tip is a little glass pipe and a piece of tinfoil.
You don't want that shit.
Get a nice call girl or something, you know?
You fuck a lot of chicks, Matthew?
Yeah, I figured, man.
Fashion, and all that shit.
Models...
Crack whores, call girls, strippers...
We could bust some strippers together, that'd be fucking awesome.
What is art?
Is this art?
Or this?
Or this?
Who's that?
Ignore that.
That's a mistake.
Hamlet.
War and Peace.
"Beethoven's 9th".
Guernica.
These are works which hold as much emotional resonance today as they did at the time of their creation.
What makes a work of art timeless?
What qualities must it possess?
- Yes?
- Everything on your list was done by a dead white male.
I noticed that too.
To be clear, they were not yet dead when they created those works.
You're just playing into the patriarchy.
The history of art is largely about the implementation of masculinity.
- That is such bullshit.
- Part of some Darwinian imperative.
Most artists become artists because they have no way to attract a mate.
I hardly think I'm the first to point out that the vast preponderance of artists are, shall we say physiologically deficient in some way.
Dribble the ball, Hurst!
Please don't yell.
- Going to Marvin Bushmiller's talk?
- Yeah, are you?
We better get there early.
It's weird how he's so famous.
I used to see him around Strathmore when I was a freshman.
I saw his show at Broadway Bob's now he's on the cover of Artforum.
- Well, that's how it works.
- Platz!
Get in there.
Mr. Bushmiller, The New York Times has called your work:
"An expedition to the far contours of an evolving techno-culture."
With that in mind, where do you see art headed in the 21st century?
"Art" who?
No, really, that's such a stupid question.
Why don't you ask me something relevant.
Ask me how much money I have in the bank, or...
Did you learn anything at Strathmore?
Yes, I learned many things.
I learned that the faculty is made up of old failures who teach only because they need the health insurance.
Present company excluded, of course.
I was about to say.
David was too busy trolling the halls for fresh meat to worry about health.
What advice would you give to a young artist...
Shut up.
There's only one question any of you wanna ask.
You wanna know what it would take to turn you into me.
Well, listen closely, because I'm gonna give you the answer.
In order to be a great artist you simply have to be a great artist.
There's nothing to learn, so you're all wasting your time.
Go home.
Why are you such an asshole?
Now, that's a great question.
No, it really is.
I am an asshole because that is my true nature.
Maybe it's everybody's true nature.
Every one of you looks like a fucking asshole, but who knows?
The difference between you and me is that I have gained the freedom to express my true nature.
And what could be more beautiful than truth and freedom?
Another day, another dollar.
Hello, Larry.
Oh, by the way are you and Lois gonna be free the night of January 18th?
How the hell should I know?
Well, I have to do this little gallery thing.
Lorenzo Massengale has been torturing me to put my new series of paintings in his new space and I just thought maybe you and Lois would want an invitation.
I think I'm busy that night, Sandiford.
Here, I stopped off at Broadway Bob's.
You're welcome.
I thought Broadway Bob's was an art gallery or something.
It's a very famous shithole run by an obnoxious windbag who takes credit for the career of every half-talented monkey who ever took a class at Strathmore.
But the coffee's good.
Hello, Lorenzo, it's Sandy.
Just wanted to make sure you got the slides and...
You don't need to call me, because I have a class starting.
So I will call you afterwards.
Thanks.
Bye.
Sorry I'm late.
Hello, dear.
Looks like this is our lucky day.
I'm sorry, Sandy, I'm just dying for a cigarette.
Yes, absolutely.
Five-minute break.
I'm gonna go to the john.
Let me borrow this.
All right.
She smiled at you, how sweet.
You've seen her before?
Who is she?
Don't get your hopes up.
She's prime real estate, my friend.
Hey, faggots.
What a cute couple.
I think they like us.
- Is she a student or just a model?
- Can we forget about her for a minute?
We're about to have a life-changing experience here.
Jimmy, it's Bardo.
Brought someone over to meet you.
I got a bottle of Slivovitz here.
It's 80 proof, made in Poland, imported by...
Boys, welcome.
I'm afraid you've interrupted me in the middle of one of my shows.
This is Jerome.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thank you for having us.
A pleasure.
Isn't this a great place?
Jimmy's got rent control.
So Jerome here wants to be a great artist, Jimmy.
How terrific.
Jerome, are you exceptionally skilled as a cocksucker?
It wasn't a rhetorical question.
Are you a great artist when it comes to fellatio?
No.
No, I guess not.
Well, that's no good.
So who do you like?
Who's your favorite artist, Jerome?
- Maybe Picasso.
- I see.
Very good.
Our old friend "pick-asshole."
The nasty little dwarf who went his whole life without a single original thought.
I presume you're joking, right?
Jimmy's a Strathmore grad.
Just look at me now.
Just think, Jerome.
One day, this could all be yours.
You're going places, young man.
I can feel it.
But you need to take some lessons in sucking cock and licking ass.
Otherwise, you might find yourself rotting away in some shithole postponing suicide for the slim chance that you might one day possibly see some glorious plague or pestilence bring horrible suffering to your hateful species.
What are you smiling about?
Laugh away, laughing boy!
I will stomp your guts till they shoot out your ass!
I will bury you alive and shit on your grave!
Okay, boys.
Show's over.
I have to get back to my masturbation.
Isn't Jimmy great?
Yeah, definitely.
Self-portrait.
Starting next week I will be selecting the most effective work from each session and placing it in the hall gallery.
- Which gallery?
- It's on this floor.
- Down at the end of the hall.
- By the men's toilet?
Yes.
Now, let's get started on these.
Who wants to comment?
I like Flower's drawing.
- Yeah.
Me too.
- It seems like she's trying to do something more than just draw herself.
It's more about the process of drawing.
All right.
Does anything else up here command your attention?
Does anyone have anything more to say on Flower's piece?
Yes, Jerome?
- Nothing.
- Well, "nothing" doesn't exist in this classroom.
What are you thinking?
We're waiting, Jerome.
I don't know.
It just...
It looks like a lame Cy Twombly imitation to me.
It looks like she did it in about two minutes.
That is such bullshit.
Because her drawing isn't perfect, it's automatically bad?
At least it has humanity.
Yeah, totally.
Jerome, your drawing looks like it was done by a machine.
Whereas Flower's...
Flower's is full of playfulness and...
Yeah, like, humanity.
What's so great about humanity?
Humans are a bunch of jerks.
I hope a plague wipes out the species.
- What is your problem?
- Jesus Christ, Jerome.
Okay, that's enough.
This is a required assignment.
I have to give it to you.
And, Flower, it is certainly not worth crying about, okay?
Hey, man.
I agree with you 100 percent.
I think the entire human race should be wiped off the face of the earth.
Oh, I didn't really mean...
I was just...
You don't have to apologize.
I'm totally with you on this.
So this is the hall gallery.
Hey.
You guys have to come to my opening tonight.
You were really an asshole in class today.
Hey.
You guys.
So are we gonna go see Shilo's opening?
- How did she ever get a gallery show?
- It's totally meaningless.
Any idiot could sign up for a student gallery.
Oh, my God.
What?
I didn't notice that.
We gotta go.
Great work, Shilo.
Hey.
Do you know this girl?
Yeah.
We had her as a model.
Remember?
But do you know who she is?
Do you know her name?
You are such a prick.
What?
You can't say anything nice about my photos?
- Hi.
- Hi.
That came out really good.
- Thank you.
- Shilo.
What?
Oh, hi.
I'm Audrey, by the way.
So is that your real name?
Or are you just obsessed with Audrey Hepburn like every art school chick?
I was named after an old cartoon.
Another ironic pop culture reference.
She's a keeper.
- Hey.
- God, do you know that guy?
- No.
I thought he was your friend.
- No way.
Oh, you're the guy from Sandy's class.
I have such a bad memory for faces.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I'm Jerome.
I was thinking about you today.
I saw an old photo of Marie-Thérèse Walter and it looked just like the way that you drew me.
She's one of the women who modeled for Picasso.
I know just the picture you're talking about.
You do?
Let's get out of here.
What?
I said I liked your photos.
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's okay.
I couldn't bear to watch you get cornered by that creep again.
Well, I have to get going anyway.
I'm kind of making the rounds tonight.
Really?
Well, maybe sometime we could...
I have to go to a Donald Baumgarten show.
Oh, I know who he is.
He's an old pop art guy, right?
Yeah, he's really good.
He's great.
He's absolutely awful.
But I can't get out of it.
Do you wanna go with me?
Come on, please.
I hate to take the subway by myself.
Especially with that weirdo out there strangling everybody.
A little bit.
Well, my parents go a lot.
Hi.
Audrey, I was afraid you weren't coming.
So how's it going?
Well, I think I might have sold two of the small ones.
- The ones you hate.
- I like them just fine.
You know that.
Just not as much as the big, blue ones.
I know.
Daddy, this is Jerome.
Jerome is a big fan of yours.
I brought him to meet you.
Jerome, this is Donald Baumgarten.
Wow.
I'm a big fan of yours, sir.
It's really a pleasure.
My pleasure, son.
Daddy, I hate to do this, but I don't think we can stay.
Jerome has to meet someone at another party, and we're late, so...
- Will I see you on Sunday?
- I'll call you.
I can't believe you grew up with a dad like that.
He's a famous artist.
He's hardly a famous artist.
It's really heartbreaking.
He should've given up, like, 30 years ago.
God, I am starving.
- Should we go eat somewhere?
- Sure.
Have you ever heard of Broadway Bob's?
So why are you a model?
Just for the money?
Oh, yeah.
I make a fortune.
My God, is that who I think it is?
He's always here.
That table is practically reserved for post-minimalists.
This is where everybody gets their first big show.
It's like the launching pad from Strathmore to the real world.
- How do they pick who gets a show?
- They go to the surveys and all that.
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?
When's the last time you came to see me?
Jerome, this is Broadway Bob.
- How you doing?
- Hi.
Bob knows everybody.
Every artist you can think of had their first show in this place.
Bushmiller, Naugle, Bilbo, you name it.
The minute they get famous, they got no time for me, right?
Hey!
I told you to stop hassling my customers!
Hector!
Fucking Brown Shirts.
What are you doing?
- Good to see you.
- Bye.
- Tell your father I said hi.
- Okay.
- Hey.
Excuse me.
- Yeah, what?
You wanna help me out?
I got two homeless fucks outside that panhandle all day.
They bother my customers outside.
This kid's not a serial killer.
Look at that guy out there.
- Just get the fuck out.
- All right, let's go.
- Your coffee sucks.
- Go to Starbucks.
Who's this?
- Jerome, this is Candace.
- Hi, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
Audrey and I used to bump cunts.
Just kidding.
But little Audrey doesn't wanna play with me anymore, does she.
What do you think of these paintings?
They're okay.
I mean, they're not the most...
They're Candace's paintings.
- They're really good.
- Where do you find them, Audrey?
Anyway, thanks to this little exhibit, I'll get a spring show at the Haberman.
- That's really great.
Congratulations.
- I know.
Golly gosh!
- You.
Get over here.
- Later, kids.
What's this I hear about a show at Haberman?
You gotta let me know...
So, what do you wanna do, Jerome?
I wanna be the greatest artist of the 21st century.
Oh, I just meant, "What do you wanna do now?"
I should probably get home.
- I'm stupid...
- No, no, I think it's great.
I think you really could be a great artist.
You have the right kind of energy.
- You won't believe...
- Did you hear the news?
- No, but guess where I was?
- The strangler got another one.
Some poor schmuck on his way to the subway.
I got a major rewrite to do.
- I was on the subway tonight.
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Anyway, guess what I was doing.
- Smoking pole?
No, I was on a date with the most beautiful girl in the whole school.
All right.
Can I smell your finger?
Look.
No shit.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
She thinks I'm a great artist.
You fucking snake.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Did you already pop her?
No, I...
- You know, we just met...
- Man, if she was my girlfriend I would be pounding that shit day and night.
November 28th.
November 28th.
Try and keep that date in your tiny, little, drug-addled brains.
That is the date of the post-Thanksgiving assessment where you'll put up all your work and a bunch of us professors are gonna sneak in behind your backs and give you a grade.
However, that is but a mere prelude to this day:
December 19th.
December 19th is the final survey where you will receive your one-and-only official grade for this class provided, of course, you all haven't been murdered by then.
I heard the final survey is where big-shot gallery owners show up to troll for new talent.
I wouldn't worry about that too much right now.
This could be a big break for somebody.
But this is not Schwab's drugstore.
You are definitely not Lana Turner.
- What does that mean?
- It means you children are too young to be worrying about that.
Now, Eno, why haven't you been doing the assignments?
Frankly, I find them constricting and largely irrelevant.
My work has nothing to do with form or light or color but with questioning the nature of aesthetic experience.
I'll buy that.
- Jonah, what about you?
- I'll bring something next time.
Sorry.
I also heard that the student with the best grade gets a show at Broadway Bob's.
- That's been known to happen, yes.
Professor Okamura said no one in your class ever got the best grade.
Well, Larry seems to care about that kind of thing a lot more than I do.
And Larry has a tendency to live vicariously through his students which I find rather pathetic.
I also heard they're cutting faculty, and all the profs are shitting bricks trying to get a student to the Broadway Bob show.
Actually.
I'm too busy concentrating on my own painting to get involved with any kind of faculty intrigue.
Is it true Marvin Bushmiller got his break when he got the best grade?
Audrey.
Hi.
I just came in to get a coffee.
I have to model for Professor Bogle's class at 6:30.
Can I walk with you?
God, you're so polite.
Sure.
Look at you.
So content with your happy, little lives.
But none of you know the taste of true happiness the happiness that only death can bring.
I am hell on earth, personified!
What do you think?
Should I trim that last part?
How much longer you gonna be?
It's up to the boss.
See you later.
Hey, hey, hey.
You can't just leave.
What do you think of the movie so far?
- It's fine.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
She doesn't get this kind of stuff.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I gotta cram some love story into this thing, man.
Those skags make up 50 percent of the audience.
You're missing the best part.
Hey.
Now we're not gonna have any more official assignments in this class.
Last week, I asked you to bring in what you thought was your best work of art, old or new.
Okay?
And we're gonna use that work as a starting point to, hopefully, help you become better artists.
"We live in a police state."
Ain't that the truth.
This is interesting.
That's not finished, but I thought the class might find it interesting to see the various stages of my process.
Indeed.
And what have we here?
- Who did this?
- That's mine.
Where have you been all my life?
- What do we think of this work, class?
- It's so...
It's like, he figured out how to unlearn all the typical art school bullshit.
It's really great.
It has the singularity of outsider art, though the conscious rejection of spatial dynamics could only come from an intimacy with the conventions of picture-making.
Are you kidding me?
You look at?
Professor Okamura, what are some of your favorite Halloween memories?
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
You want a drink?
There's some weird orange punch over there.
- Yeah.
That's really sweet.
Thank you.
- Okay.
Better get back there.
You're about to get cock-blocked by Joe College.
How did you do that painting?
It's like you've never seen another painting before.
What the fuck?
My God, we look like Bonnie and Clyde.
Oh, thanks.
Isn't it weird?
Look how perfectly we match.
- That's great.
- There's an empty seat over there.
Looks like a duel.
No?
Comments?
Jonah's seems totally original and authentic.
And Jerome's just seems lame.
It's pathetic.
No offense.
Yeah, it's like Jonah is tapping into this total childhood innocence.
He's got a whole way of seeing that's completely outside the box.
And Jerome is totally in the box, you know?
- Yeah.
It sucks.
- You know, Jerome's is really...
Okay, I think that's fine.
We shouldn't be too hard on Jerome.
Jerome's trying to do something that is essentially impossible.
He's trying to sing in his own voice using someone else's vocal chords.
I mean, it's the greatest.
He picks a completely random victim.
I mean, this chick was, like...
She was, like, a cashier or something.
- How do they know it's the same guy?
- Come on, it's obvious.
There's a million clues.
For one thing, he always...
- Okay, I believe you.
- Look at her.
She was only 31 years old.
I mean, it's like a goddamn miracle.
Here I am, busting my nuts trying to find some female character for my movie and this guy goes and drops one right in my lap.
Murder?
Don't worry so much, man.
No one's gonna murder me.
I don't want nothing to happen to my best ho.
The streets ain't safe no more.
Not since...
Fuck you.
You're just trying to keep me down, and I am not your whore any more.
I mean...
I'm not your whore no more.
This is total shit, you know that?
No, I don't know that.
Come on.
All of this "gangsta," "motherfucker" bullshit.
Why do you wanna regurgitate this Hollywood crap for the zillionth time?
Don't you have anything original to say?
- I think I do.
- Then you need to say it.
Because this is completely worthless.
- Hello?
- Hi.
It's Jerome Platz.
- Hey, Jerome Platz.
- Hey, I was just calling...
To...
I've got...
I've gotta go home for Thanksgiving, and I was wondering if you had any plans, if, maybe, you wanted to come with me...
Unfortunately, I have to go up north to visit my grandmother.
- But that's really nice of you.
- No...
Don't be silly.
Have a great time.
I'll talk to you soon.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Take care.
Bye.
I think maybe I'll go on tour with Dominick's band this summer.
They're playing shows in the Midwest.
They need someone to sell T-shirts.
Who's Dominick?
This guy, who's friends with Stacy's big brother.
- Forget about it.
- God, you are so unfair.
Jerome gets to go to art school, and I can't go on a summer trip.
You gonna get a job doing paintings somewhere once school's done?
That's not really how it works.
Who in their right mind would buy your paintings?
- Cynthia.
- God, you love Jerome more than me.
You know what you gotta do?
Figure out who's the top guy in your business and hook up with him.
It's not what you do so much as who you know.
That's how it is in my business, and it's all about business.
Yeah.
Actually, I've kind of made a connection already.
My girlfriend's dad is kind of a famous artist, so...
- Your what?
- Hugh help me get the rest of the pies out of the oven?
We thought for sure you were a homo.
My friend's granddaughter paints little pictures on the shoes...
Oh, what do you call them?
Anyhow, she paints pictures of little animals and whatnot.
And I believe the other children pay her for it.
"Sneakers."
Isn't that what they call them?
Anyhow, that's something I thought you could do, Jeremy.
It's not that at all.
It's just that, I really felt that they were some of, really, the best things I'd done in a very long time.
And I'm just...
And I'm just slightly surprised that...
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
I'm Helena Sandiford.
Sandy will be right with you.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate...
No, I do.
I do understand.
No.
Not at all.
And I really appreciate you looking at the slides.
Yeah.
And you.
Bye.
Go fuck yourself, Lorenzo!
Those are mine, yes.
They're really good.
Yes, I rather like them.
Unfortunately, we're not in the majority, Jerome.
Apparently, they're a little too "difficult" for some people.
So how long have you been doing the triangles?
A long time.
I was one of the first.
So tell me, Jerome what are you not getting out of my class?
I don't know.
I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing and...
Maybe I should be finding my own style or voice or something.
That is absolute bullshit.
What would an artist at your age want with a style?
What about Jonah?
He's got sort of a style.
No, Jonah doesn't have a style.
He has a sort of "nowness."
It's exciting.
It's seductive.
But that does not mean, Jerome that he is a better artist than you are.
Far from it.
You're very similar to me.
It is going to take you a very long time to get where you're going.
Look, do you have any idea how long it took me to paint like this?
- No.
- Twenty-five years.
Jerome, it is absolutely essential at your age that you start to experiment with all the arts all the philosophies and all the lifestyles.
So, that's what you think I should do, is try a bunch of different styles and see where it takes me?
Yes, yes and yes, Jerome.
- Okay.
- I have seen so many young artists get locked into this incredibly rigid way of thinking.
So that's what I should try to do, is experiment?
Absolutely.
And I am here to facilitate that experimentation in any way I can either in or out of the classroom.
Thank you, professor.
For the last time, come on, get out.
Get out of my building.
He says they're all done.
We can go in now.
Too experimental.
You're all over the map.
No focus.
Hollow and derivative.
You need to be yourself.
What's up, Platz?
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are you going to Marvin Bushmiller's opening?
No.
I didn't even know about it.
It might be an invite-only thing.
It's probably done through his gallery.
- I'm sure it'll be a total drag, anyway.
- When is it?
I don't even know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I can't believe it.
I got an "A."
Everybody got an "A".
It's a total scam to trick everybody into feeling good about themselves.
Yeah, well, I never got better than a "C" in my whole life.
That's hard to believe.
Yeah, well, guess I didn't go to class too much.
- I was too busy getting into trouble.
- Really.
Yeah, me too.
No kidding.
Did you grow up in the city?
Well, not right in the city.
But I came here all the time.
All the fucking time.
Practically lived here.
So how about it, dude?
You got any deep, dark secrets we should know about?
Forgive me!
What the hell was that?
Don't worry, it's a totally rough cut.
That's a temp score without...
I thought you were gonna make a nice little murder picture but, here, you got the worms and the dancing...
- Did you like it?
- It's symbolism, Grandpa.
And where are the guns?
I thought this was a shoot-them-up.
The guy's a strangler, Grandpa.
What am I supposed to do?
I want guns.
The movie is called, The Strathmore Strangler.
You want the strangler to shoot people?
I paid for a movie with guns.
Hello, Torsiello Gallery.
I can put you on the pre-waiting list.
It's not working.
Do it better.
Excuse me.
We're closed.
I heard that Mr. Bushmiller was having a party tonight.
And I was just wondering if there was...
Sorry.
Invite only.
I was gonna make up some elaborate lie, but I decided to be honest.
I'm desperate.
I'm not crazy.
I won't even talk to Mr. Bushmiller.
You see how busy I am here?
Please.
Please.
Did you put any grenadine in this?
I'm new to this.
I'm sorry.
I'd like a Martell.
There you go.
I heard that Marvin needed some help, so I figured, why not?
I'll have a...
I'm just gonna take one of these.
Just a Bud is fine.
We have...
Hoegaarden or Stella Artois.
The first one.
You look pretty busy, so...
I drink Slivovitz, not Sambuca.
You were right about art.
It's all about the cock-sucking.
It's not what you do, but who you blow.
And even that's not enough.
You don't even have a chance, unless you're the most ruthless cold-blooded...
Jesus, I'm really sorry.
Have you heard about the great man's latest masterpiece?
- No.
- Some of his finest work, I believe.
Damn good stuff.
Who?
The murderer?
"The murderer"?
That's so disrespectful.
Got a few victims for him, if he's interested.
Do you wanna see my paintings?
This is my humble tribute to the great man.
He doesn't simply reproduce reality, like an ordinary idiot artist.
He courageously reshapes it to suit his own needs.
And why did our great artist select these particular victims?
Who can say?
A real artist knows when he's found his ideal subject.
Perhaps, this one was a dishonest cashier.
This one might have reminded him of a domineering aunt.
And this one...
Maybe he was just too stupid to be allowed to live.
All of humanity is too stupid to live.
Fuck them all.
My boy.
I say, you can't do anything really good until you truly don't care at all if you live or die.
Kill me right now.
I couldn't care less.
It's only when every human misery is just a big joke that you can finally get some enjoyment out of this life.
I wish someone would kill me right now.
- Do you want me to kill you?
- Go for it.
Well, I guess I'd better be going, before I throw up on your rug again.
Wait.
I wanna give you something.
- What's this?
- A gift, from me to you.
- No, I couldn't.
- You could.
You could.
Let's see some ID.
ID.
Are you drunk?
No.
Well, look who's here.
One of those.
Where the hell you been all week?
Been having a really hard time.
Yeah?
Well, you should just do what I always do.
Drop out, and start over again next semester.
This is my third time, soon to be my fourth.
You don't understand.
I'll never have another chance like this.
I can't just start over.
I'll never find another Audrey.
Don't start with this shit again.
Every artist needs a subject, and she's my perfect subject.
- I can't let her slip through my fingers.
- Hey, come on.
Let's rescue these art chicks.
That's easy pickings.
If I can just come up with something for that final survey she'll forget all about Jonah.
- We're gonna miss our chance here.
- I just need to think of something.
There they go.
What can I do?
You know, I think I just figured out who you are.
- Who?
- You're the class douche bag.
Thanks for the beer.
Oh, please.
You can't fall for every guy who does a halfway-decent painting.
I don't know.
There's something about him.
You don't need any more boyfriends, you need about 15 years of therapy.
I thought you were all mad for what's-his-name...
Jonah.
Look when this one doesn't work out you can always come crawling back to me.
So, looks like you finally got Jonah on the run.
- What do you mean?
- He was asking about some painting of yours.
You got a surprise for the final survey?
What do you want?
I need a big favor.
- I see you've come empty-handed.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
You must think I'm the cheapest whore in town.
I'll bring you a case of Slivovitz.
Whatever you want.
I just...
I wanna buy the rest of your paintings.
- They're not for sale.
- Please, just tell me what you want.
- I don't want anything.
- I'm just fucking lost...
- I thought you were an artist.
- I am.
I am.
You wanna be an artist or an "aficionado"?
An artist.
What do you think an artist cares about?
Does he think all day about fine wines and black-tie affairs and what he's gonna say at the next after-dinner speech?
No.
He lives only for that narcotic moment of creative bliss.
A moment that may come once a decade.
Or never at all.
You think I'm wrong?
Fuck you.
You know nothing at all about anything.
- Listen, I don't care about fine wines.
- Oh, I know what you want.
If it was me, I'd get my way by any means possible.
I'd grab them by the balls, and I'd never stop twisting.
Once you're on top, they're helpless.
You've got them squirming under the toe of your shoe.
Would you please put out that goddamn cigarette before you kill me with your awful smoke!
What about the paintings?
I don't care, do whatever you want.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.
I have a confession to make.
Yeah?
Forget it.
- No, what?
- Nothing.
Forget I said anything.
- What is it?
Some boyfriend problem?
- What?
Why?
- I don't know.
What is it?
- Why did you say that?
Do you think I'm gay?
- I don't know.
- Really?
Yeah.
Maybe a little, I guess.
Yeah.
Well, that's it.
That's my confession.
I think I'm gay.
Okay.
Okay.
I thought you said you were working.
I am working.
I gotta have this done for Monday.
It looks fine, Jonah.
It doesn't have to be perfect.
It's got a long way to go.
What's gotten into you?
When you were working Narcotics you didn't spend your off-hours smoking crack.
And what about your son?
He misses his daddy.
Will you get off my ass for once?
Lonny and the guys are here, or are you too busy for them?
Well, look who's here.
How's the Mona Lisa coming, Rembrandt?
You're off duty, Jonah.
You don't gotta dress like a fruitcake.
Yeah.
It's good to see you guys too.
How much longer is this gonna go on, Lonny?
I never see him anymore since he became an artist.
I'm just trying to do my job.
That's a good question, Marie.
So, what about it, superstar?
Hey, we got the blow-ups of the pictures you took.
He used the same colors we found on the glove of the first crime scene.
I don't know about this guy Platz.
He didn't live near the campus when the first killings took place.
He used to come to the city all the time.
He told me so himself.
It would've helped if you had taken a paint sample.
You can't just monkey around with a piece of art like that...
"Piece of shit" is more like it.
You take a look at this fucking thing?
Excuse me, Marie.
We can't even question this asshole?
It's like he's making fun of us.
I'm taking shit to this day about that first weirdo you dragged in.
I can't afford any more fuck-ups.
I need better shit than this, Jonah.
Listen to me, Gerry.
Will you listen to me?
Look...
I know you're a genius, but I'm a genius too.
What are you, on vacation?
Move your ass.
Look, this dyke is gonna make us both a fortune, I'm telling you.
I'm 100 percent on this one.
Fine.
Don't listen to me.
What do I care?
Don't you ever call me again, you ungrateful prick.
Excuse me?
I'm in your Tuesday/Thursday class.
Can I ask you a question?
So, there's this freshman survey tomorrow.
And you wanna know what you can do to land a big gallery contract like Marvin Bushmiller.
No.
Not exactly.
Perhaps you want a major retrospective at the Metropolitan?
Actually, there's someone who...
I don't know.
I want her to...
It's for a girl?
Yeah.
You wanna take the prize so you can win the heart of a girl?
Yeah.
That's so exciting.
Think you could look at my paintings and tell me if they're good enough?
No.
But I'll be rooting for you.
Hey.
Think Jonah's getting any gash on the side?
No.
Marie's got him so pussy-whipped it's not even funny.
Hey, hey.
That's our guy.
That's our guy, right there.
Will you look at him.
I ought to wring his neck right now.
- What the fuck are we waiting for?
- He couldn't strangle a cat.
Fucking scumbag!
Where the fuck is Jonah?
Lonny told him to be on the guy's ass.
Jesus, that was disappointing.
Who are you trying to fool with that badass stuff?
All that murder shit?
Totally September 10th, Jerome.
Jerome...
Have you seen Jonah?
No.
Don't despair, okay?
You call me over the break, and we'll get you right back on track.
Okay?
Okay, you win.
It's all yours, so live it up.
- Jerome...
- You're the one out of 100 that goes on to fame and fortune.
I'm just another deluded asshole.
- These paintings...
- Fuck those paintings, and fuck you.
You have everybody fooled, but not me.
You came up with a good gimmick, your tough-guy, Joe Normal act but your paintings are fucking bullshit, and you know it.
Well I still kicked your ass, didn't I?
Jonah, come on.
Where you been?
We gotta go.
Jerome, wait here.
I wanna talk to you.
You have to meet your public.
Marvelous work, Jonah.
Good job, Jonah.
Building burned up.
Everybody died.
Some asshole didn't put out his cigarette.
This is it.
What the fuck, Jonah.
Mikey, get your ass over here.
Where's Jonah?
So?
What?
This fucking nobody is gonna stand me up?
I gave him the message, Mr. D'Annunzio.
Hey, come on.
Bob hates people being late.
I really gotta find Jerome.
Come on.
Don't shoot me, man!
Don't shoot!
Police!
Get down on the ground!
Face down!
Cut!
What are you doing, asshole, you ruined my best take!
My arm...
I think my arm is broken.
Well, that's great!
What in fuck's name do I do now?
Hey!
Where have you been?
What the hell is this?
What is this nonsense?
Let's go, hotshot.
Chief wants you right now, come on.
What are you thinking, huh?
You paying attention to me?
God, I'm a fucking idiot.
Did you see a portrait of me?
A really beautiful...
It was right here.
I chucked everything out back.
Police!
Open the door!
I got a warrant!
Police!
Don't try anything!
- Oh, Jesus.
- This isn't what you think.
- Jerome Platz!
- Jerome Platz!
Jerome Platz!
You in there?
- Jerome Platz!
- Hey, Jerome Platz!
Audrey, I know you don't care about me but maybe someday you'll...
Excuse me.
Police business.
Clear the way, please.
Excuse me.
Are we gonna have a problem?
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.
Go draw something, will you?
Lonny, I'm sorry.
I know I let personal things get in the way of my job but it'll never happen again.
- Superstar, we got him.
- All's well that ends well, okay?
- Hey, Jonah.
You suck!
Have a nice death, pig.
You wanna spit at us again?
I will take you down so fast, you got no idea, you fucking freak.
Mikey, let's clear it up and get out of here.
- Kevin, you wanna ride with him?
- Let me do it, Lonny.
- Yeah, you fucking pig!
- Fucking pig!
Well, I knew there was something weird about you.
What did you really think about my?
Did you think my paintings were any good at all?
- Yeah, maybe.
- I could have made it as an artist?
No, I don't know about that.
Hey.
So are you really the guy?
Jerome, look over here!
Let me get a picture!
Jerome!
Jerome.
Visiting hours.
Should we judge an artist by what he does in his personal life?
If he's an anti-Semite, like T.S. Eliot or a bully, like Picasso or in this case, a murderer should his art have any less value?
I think not.
Look, if I wanna have a showing of this artist's work nobody has any right to stop me.
I'm fighting for First Amendment rights.
You're with me or you're a fucking Nazi, as far as I'm concerned.
What?
Why can't I say that?
We didn't even know it was a documentary at first, but then you know, it just sort of all came together.
I mean, that's the way I like to work.
Finding my way as I go along.
No, I don't think I'd ever sell it.
Jerome was always so passionate about his art.
It's really unfortunate what happened but, I mean, I always knew he'd be a famous artist someday.
I just wanna do what's best for my client.
Why don't you trust Jerome to know what's best?
And what's best for Jerome is to stay for as long as possible followed by a lengthy trial.
I have more than enough evidence to get him out.
- This case should not even go to trial.
- Where the fuck did they find you?
Jerome needs a lawyer who understands what to do when a situation like this presents itself.
I am very close to the family.
I went to school with Hugh Platz.
That's real nice.
Now, look...
You know how many paintings I can sell for your client while this is going on?
Jerome.
How's my boy?
- How's the work coming?
- It's fine.
Can't believe how many people are calling about you.
- I had to cut off the waiting list.
- Great.
Jerome, I just wanna let you know if you change your mind, we can get you out of here.
I know, I know.
But we've been through all this.
Are these my only visitors?
Jerome, you get a chance to call the guy from Artforum?
He wants to talk.
Also, did you take a moment to look at those papers?
I need you to sign the yellow one.
Keep your chin up, Jerome.
We all love you.
- All right.
- I'll call you tonight.
Hi.
Hey.
- Can we go now?
- Cut.
I am a genius.
I am the greatest artist of the 20th century.
My name is Pablo Picasso.
I pretty much invented modern art.
And I do weird, abstract paintings even though I can paint totally realistic, if I wanted to.
Also, even though I'm super short and bald I am able to have sex with any beautiful woman I want just because I'm so great.
Come here.
Look.
- Pretty good.
- Thanks.
Some day, if you get famous, this can be worth a lot of money.
You're wasting your time, Jerome.
You gotta set your sights on a more realistic girl.
Shit, here comes Stoob.
Hey, pencil-prick, thanks for helping me with that poster for Erikson's class.
- He said I was a natural artist.
- A natural scam artist.
Got that right, queer-bait.
What's this?
- Are you jacking off in school now?
- It's a college brochure, you moron.
What college has a naked chick for a teacher?
She's an art model, you stupid ape.
Hey.
You're all right, Platz.
I don't know, Jerome.
It just seems a little too good to be true.
Don't you think?
Fucking shit!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's based on the whole thing with the campus murder, but...
Hell no, it ain't no boring-ass documentary.
Look, forget that shit, okay?
Yeah, fucking A, there's gonna be tons of action, are you kidding me?
- You're an art major?
- Yeah.
Drawing and painting.
- What are you guys?
- I'm fashion.
He's film, I guess.
Are you for real?
You're shitting me, right?
- Well, yeah.
- God, this is so depressing.
- Why, what's wrong?
- I just really, really miss my girlfriend.
One hundred percent.
Yeah, you won't be sorry.
I love you too, Grandpa.
Yes!
Yes!
I'm so fucking pumped!
- I'm Vince.
- Hi.
Jerome.
How are you?
- What's your name again?
- Matthew.
God, I'm so fucking jazzed.
I get to make my movie.
That's fantastic.
- You guys freshmen?
- Yeah.
- You a sophomore?
- Junior.
It's all right.
You listen to me, you'll be okay.
Why do you still live in the dorm?
A lot of juniors still live in the dorm.
What's wrong with that?
That guy's some hot shit sculpture major.
I have never seen so many beautiful girls.
This is nothing.
Dude, you should've seen last year's crop.
Enrollment's way off since the murders.
- What murders?
- You're shitting me, right?
I heard about it.
Somebody killed a guy on campus, or whatever.
Yeah.
Three people in the neighborhood since March.
You're fucking with me.
You've never heard about the Strathmore Strangler?
He killed a guy, like, 10 days ago.
- Are you from out of state?
- The suburbs.
Then you have no excuse.
What about Richard Natwick?
- Jesus.
- Sorry, I don't really follow the news.
Okay, I'm gonna give you the story...
You gotta pay attention.
Because this story is huge.
This is, like, national news, man.
I'm listening.
Just after the first murder, there's this guy, Richard Natwick.
He's, like, some second-year painting major.
Does these stupid-ass word paintings.
He has a show at the student center.
Cops send some guys to check it out.
But they're not used to this kind of artsy bullshit, right?
- Fucking...
- Cut your shit.
Get used to being bent over, prick.
So then a couple of professors freak out.
And before you know it, he's like a fucking martyr.
Art is not a crime!
Art is not a crime!
Of course, it turns out he's completely innocent.
And the cops have to totally eat shit.
- So, what happened to him?
- He had his 15 minutes of fame.
Then he got hurt real bad in some crazy-ass performance art thing.
Okay hit the juice.
Anyway, you gotta read my script.
I mean, it's all in there.
It's totally huge.
So, what, you don't get the paper in the suburbs?
I mean, for all they know, the killer could be from the suburbs.
Those cops, they don't know shit.
So, what, you're a drawing major?
Yeah.
Drawing and painting.
That's awesome.
I hear you guys get to see tons of naked vagina.
Okay, Leslie.
Time to work your magic.
First pose, people.
We're gonna hit the ground running.
Okay, first pose.
I don't have any particular wisdom to impart to you people, except this:
These four words:
Don't have unrealistic expectations.
If you wanna make money, better drop out right now.
Go to banking school or website school.
Anywhere but art school.
And remember, only one out of 100 of you will ever make a living as an artist.
Hello?
Yes.
Ah, Lorenzo.
No.
Absolutely, yes...
Sandy, can I get a break up here?
Take a break.
Five minutes.
Are you kidding?
I would absolutely love to have you look at it.
No, because I feel like I've really turned a corner with this latest series.
In January?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sure I could.
I mean, I don't think my plate is completely full.
Well, I'd be happy...
No, of course not.
Hi.
- Really pretty, what you're doing.
- I gotta go.
Jesus.
Why are the people in these freshman classes exactly the same every year?
Look.
You got the vegan holy man.
The boring blowhard.
- The angry lesbian.
- Professor?
Professor?
Professor?
And here, you got kiss-ass.
I wanted to tell you that I looked up some of your paintings on the Internet.
- I thought they were really terrific.
- You get an "A" for the class.
And Mom.
I feel that I am finally about to ripen.
Artistically.
Mom's youngest just left the nest so she's ready to explore her creative side.
How do you know all this stuff?
Because I'm a living cliché just like the rest of these guys.
I'm the guy who keeps dropping out and changing majors because he's afraid he really sucks at everything.
So who am I?
I don't know.
I haven't figured you out yet.
Jesus.
Who's the weirdo?
Professor?
Professor?
Professor Okamura?
What is your attendance policy for this class?
I don't care if you come to class or not.
This is ready for the kiln.
Let me see if I got this right:
You're the guy that never got laid in high school.
So you came here to try to bone your way through an endless lineup of art skanks.
Not exactly.
I mean, I really do wanna be an artist.
A great artist, you know, if possible.
Which enables you to bone your way through a lineup of art skanks.
So why wait, man?
Art school's like a pussy buffet.
I don't want just any girl.
All right.
There she is.
There is the beautiful beatnik art chick of your dreams.
- Yeah, so?
- So ask her to borrow something.
It's the easiest thing in the world.
Want me to teach you?
Daddy will bring you there.
- Jesus...
- Come on.
Hi...
Do you think I could borrow your pencil?
Why?
- What for?
- Doesn't matter, it was a stupid idea.
Oh, my God.
You have the most beautiful eyes.
You have to let me take a picture of them.
Okay.
How about pizza?
Do you wanna go get pizza?
The only trouble with that is all those beatnik chicks are totally insane.
Look, what you really want is a nice, innocent, suburban girl.
Some freshman chick who hasn't been corrupted yet.
Stay out of that cave, Koala Bear.
There's snakes and bats.
Don't be silly, Pepper.
I'm not afraid of a little snake.
You know, come to think of it, they're all insane.
Just find yourself some nympho slut and get it over with.
Excuse me.
Can you help me get this off?
I want you to know, I definitely don't have AIDS.
I've been tested, like, 40 times, so I know it for a fact.
Keep the fucking kid quiet, you motherfucking asshole!
It's just my old man.
Are you serious?
You've never been laid before?
It just hasn't worked out yet.
I have very high standards.
Man, I gotta take you out whore-busting some night.
We gotta remedy this situation before it gets any worse.
Maybe you have issues that make it difficult to feel comfortable with your own sexuality.
Could be, I guess.
You guys know what whore-busting is, right?
You leave the money on the dresser, fuck the whore and go to sleep.
You wake up, not only is your money still there, but she's left you a tip.
It's the fucking greatest deal ever, man.
Crackheads aren't so good.
Their tip is a little glass pipe and a piece of tinfoil.
You don't want that shit.
Get a nice call girl or something, you know?
You fuck a lot of chicks, Matthew?
Yeah, I figured, man.
Fashion, and all that shit.
Models...
Crack whores, call girls, strippers...
We could bust some strippers together, that'd be fucking awesome.
What is art?
Is this art?
Or this?
Or this?
Who's that?
Ignore that.
That's a mistake.
Hamlet.
War and Peace.
"Beethoven's 9th".
Guernica.
These are works which hold as much emotional resonance today as they did at the time of their creation.
What makes a work of art timeless?
What qualities must it possess?
- Yes?
- Everything on your list was done by a dead white male.
I noticed that too.
To be clear, they were not yet dead when they created those works.
You're just playing into the patriarchy.
The history of art is largely about the implementation of masculinity.
- That is such bullshit.
- Part of some Darwinian imperative.
Most artists become artists because they have no way to attract a mate.
I hardly think I'm the first to point out that the vast preponderance of artists are, shall we say physiologically deficient in some way.
Dribble the ball, Hurst!
Please don't yell.
- Going to Marvin Bushmiller's talk?
- Yeah, are you?
We better get there early.
It's weird how he's so famous.
I used to see him around Strathmore when I was a freshman.
I saw his show at Broadway Bob's now he's on the cover of Artforum.
- Well, that's how it works.
- Platz!
Get in there.
Mr. Bushmiller, The New York Times has called your work:
"An expedition to the far contours of an evolving techno-culture."
With that in mind, where do you see art headed in the 21st century?
"Art" who?
No, really, that's such a stupid question.
Why don't you ask me something relevant.
Ask me how much money I have in the bank, or...
Did you learn anything at Strathmore?
Yes, I learned many things.
I learned that the faculty is made up of old failures who teach only because they need the health insurance.
Present company excluded, of course.
I was about to say.
David was too busy trolling the halls for fresh meat to worry about health.
What advice would you give to a young artist...
Shut up.
There's only one question any of you wanna ask.
You wanna know what it would take to turn you into me.
Well, listen closely, because I'm gonna give you the answer.
In order to be a great artist you simply have to be a great artist.
There's nothing to learn, so you're all wasting your time.
Go home.
Why are you such an asshole?
Now, that's a great question.
No, it really is.
I am an asshole because that is my true nature.
Maybe it's everybody's true nature.
Every one of you looks like a fucking asshole, but who knows?
The difference between you and me is that I have gained the freedom to express my true nature.
And what could be more beautiful than truth and freedom?
Another day, another dollar.
Hello, Larry.
Oh, by the way are you and Lois gonna be free the night of January 18th?
How the hell should I know?
Well, I have to do this little gallery thing.
Lorenzo Massengale has been torturing me to put my new series of paintings in his new space and I just thought maybe you and Lois would want an invitation.
I think I'm busy that night, Sandiford.
Here, I stopped off at Broadway Bob's.
You're welcome.
I thought Broadway Bob's was an art gallery or something.
It's a very famous shithole run by an obnoxious windbag who takes credit for the career of every half-talented monkey who ever took a class at Strathmore.
But the coffee's good.
Hello, Lorenzo, it's Sandy.
Just wanted to make sure you got the slides and...
You don't need to call me, because I have a class starting.
So I will call you afterwards.
Thanks.
Bye.
Sorry I'm late.
Hello, dear.
Looks like this is our lucky day.
I'm sorry, Sandy, I'm just dying for a cigarette.
Yes, absolutely.
Five-minute break.
I'm gonna go to the john.
Let me borrow this.
All right.
She smiled at you, how sweet.
You've seen her before?
Who is she?
Don't get your hopes up.
She's prime real estate, my friend.
Hey, faggots.
What a cute couple.
I think they like us.
- Is she a student or just a model?
- Can we forget about her for a minute?
We're about to have a life-changing experience here.
Jimmy, it's Bardo.
Brought someone over to meet you.
I got a bottle of Slivovitz here.
It's 80 proof, made in Poland, imported by...
Boys, welcome.
I'm afraid you've interrupted me in the middle of one of my shows.
This is Jerome.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thank you for having us.
A pleasure.
Isn't this a great place?
Jimmy's got rent control.
So Jerome here wants to be a great artist, Jimmy.
How terrific.
Jerome, are you exceptionally skilled as a cocksucker?
It wasn't a rhetorical question.
Are you a great artist when it comes to fellatio?
No.
No, I guess not.
Well, that's no good.
So who do you like?
Who's your favorite artist, Jerome?
- Maybe Picasso.
- I see.
Very good.
Our old friend "pick-asshole."
The nasty little dwarf who went his whole life without a single original thought.
I presume you're joking, right?
Jimmy's a Strathmore grad.
Just look at me now.
Just think, Jerome.
One day, this could all be yours.
You're going places, young man.
I can feel it.
But you need to take some lessons in sucking cock and licking ass.
Otherwise, you might find yourself rotting away in some shithole postponing suicide for the slim chance that you might one day possibly see some glorious plague or pestilence bring horrible suffering to your hateful species.
What are you smiling about?
Laugh away, laughing boy!
I will stomp your guts till they shoot out your ass!
I will bury you alive and shit on your grave!
Okay, boys.
Show's over.
I have to get back to my masturbation.
Isn't Jimmy great?
Yeah, definitely.
Self-portrait.
Starting next week I will be selecting the most effective work from each session and placing it in the hall gallery.
- Which gallery?
- It's on this floor.
- Down at the end of the hall.
- By the men's toilet?
Yes.
Now, let's get started on these.
Who wants to comment?
I like Flower's drawing.
- Yeah.
Me too.
- It seems like she's trying to do something more than just draw herself.
It's more about the process of drawing.
All right.
Does anything else up here command your attention?
Does anyone have anything more to say on Flower's piece?
Yes, Jerome?
- Nothing.
- Well, "nothing" doesn't exist in this classroom.
What are you thinking?
We're waiting, Jerome.
I don't know.
It just...
It looks like a lame Cy Twombly imitation to me.
It looks like she did it in about two minutes.
That is such bullshit.
Because her drawing isn't perfect, it's automatically bad?
At least it has humanity.
Yeah, totally.
Jerome, your drawing looks like it was done by a machine.
Whereas Flower's...
Flower's is full of playfulness and...
Yeah, like, humanity.
What's so great about humanity?
Humans are a bunch of jerks.
I hope a plague wipes out the species.
- What is your problem?
- Jesus Christ, Jerome.
Okay, that's enough.
This is a required assignment.
I have to give it to you.
And, Flower, it is certainly not worth crying about, okay?
Hey, man.
I agree with you 100 percent.
I think the entire human race should be wiped off the face of the earth.
Oh, I didn't really mean...
I was just...
You don't have to apologize.
I'm totally with you on this.
So this is the hall gallery.
Hey.
You guys have to come to my opening tonight.
You were really an asshole in class today.
Hey.
You guys.
So are we gonna go see Shilo's opening?
- How did she ever get a gallery show?
- It's totally meaningless.
Any idiot could sign up for a student gallery.
Oh, my God.
What?
I didn't notice that.
We gotta go.
Great work, Shilo.
Hey.
Do you know this girl?
Yeah.
We had her as a model.
Remember?
But do you know who she is?
Do you know her name?
You are such a prick.
What?
You can't say anything nice about my photos?
- Hi.
- Hi.
That came out really good.
- Thank you.
- Shilo.
What?
Oh, hi.
I'm Audrey, by the way.
So is that your real name?
Or are you just obsessed with Audrey Hepburn like every art school chick?
I was named after an old cartoon.
Another ironic pop culture reference.
She's a keeper.
- Hey.
- God, do you know that guy?
- No.
I thought he was your friend.
- No way.
Oh, you're the guy from Sandy's class.
I have such a bad memory for faces.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I'm Jerome.
I was thinking about you today.
I saw an old photo of Marie-Thérèse Walter and it looked just like the way that you drew me.
She's one of the women who modeled for Picasso.
I know just the picture you're talking about.
You do?
Let's get out of here.
What?
I said I liked your photos.
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's okay.
I couldn't bear to watch you get cornered by that creep again.
Well, I have to get going anyway.
I'm kind of making the rounds tonight.
Really?
Well, maybe sometime we could...
I have to go to a Donald Baumgarten show.
Oh, I know who he is.
He's an old pop art guy, right?
Yeah, he's really good.
He's great.
He's absolutely awful.
But I can't get out of it.
Do you wanna go with me?
Come on, please.
I hate to take the subway by myself.
Especially with that weirdo out there strangling everybody.
A little bit.
Well, my parents go a lot.
Hi.
Audrey, I was afraid you weren't coming.
So how's it going?
Well, I think I might have sold two of the small ones.
- The ones you hate.
- I like them just fine.
You know that.
Just not as much as the big, blue ones.
I know.
Daddy, this is Jerome.
Jerome is a big fan of yours.
I brought him to meet you.
Jerome, this is Donald Baumgarten.
Wow.
I'm a big fan of yours, sir.
It's really a pleasure.
My pleasure, son.
Daddy, I hate to do this, but I don't think we can stay.
Jerome has to meet someone at another party, and we're late, so...
- Will I see you on Sunday?
- I'll call you.
I can't believe you grew up with a dad like that.
He's a famous artist.
He's hardly a famous artist.
It's really heartbreaking.
He should've given up, like, 30 years ago.
God, I am starving.
- Should we go eat somewhere?
- Sure.
Have you ever heard of Broadway Bob's?
So why are you a model?
Just for the money?
Oh, yeah.
I make a fortune.
My God, is that who I think it is?
He's always here.
That table is practically reserved for post-minimalists.
This is where everybody gets their first big show.
It's like the launching pad from Strathmore to the real world.
- How do they pick who gets a show?
- They go to the surveys and all that.
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?
When's the last time you came to see me?
Jerome, this is Broadway Bob.
- How you doing?
- Hi.
Bob knows everybody.
Every artist you can think of had their first show in this place.
Bushmiller, Naugle, Bilbo, you name it.
The minute they get famous, they got no time for me, right?
Hey!
I told you to stop hassling my customers!
Hector!
Fucking Brown Shirts.
What are you doing?
- Good to see you.
- Bye.
- Tell your father I said hi.
- Okay.
- Hey.
Excuse me.
- Yeah, what?
You wanna help me out?
I got two homeless fucks outside that panhandle all day.
They bother my customers outside.
This kid's not a serial killer.
Look at that guy out there.
- Just get the fuck out.
- All right, let's go.
- Your coffee sucks.
- Go to Starbucks.
Who's this?
- Jerome, this is Candace.
- Hi, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
Audrey and I used to bump cunts.
Just kidding.
But little Audrey doesn't wanna play with me anymore, does she.
What do you think of these paintings?
They're okay.
I mean, they're not the most...
They're Candace's paintings.
- They're really good.
- Where do you find them, Audrey?
Anyway, thanks to this little exhibit, I'll get a spring show at the Haberman.
- That's really great.
Congratulations.
- I know.
Golly gosh!
- You.
Get over here.
- Later, kids.
What's this I hear about a show at Haberman?
You gotta let me know...
So, what do you wanna do, Jerome?
I wanna be the greatest artist of the 21st century.
Oh, I just meant, "What do you wanna do now?"
I should probably get home.
- I'm stupid...
- No, no, I think it's great.
I think you really could be a great artist.
You have the right kind of energy.
- You won't believe...
- Did you hear the news?
- No, but guess where I was?
- The strangler got another one.
Some poor schmuck on his way to the subway.
I got a major rewrite to do.
- I was on the subway tonight.
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Anyway, guess what I was doing.
- Smoking pole?
No, I was on a date with the most beautiful girl in the whole school.
All right.
Can I smell your finger?
Look.
No shit.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
She thinks I'm a great artist.
You fucking snake.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Did you already pop her?
No, I...
- You know, we just met...
- Man, if she was my girlfriend I would be pounding that shit day and night.
November 28th.
November 28th.
Try and keep that date in your tiny, little, drug-addled brains.
That is the date of the post-Thanksgiving assessment where you'll put up all your work and a bunch of us professors are gonna sneak in behind your backs and give you a grade.
However, that is but a mere prelude to this day:
December 19th.
December 19th is the final survey where you will receive your one-and-only official grade for this class provided, of course, you all haven't been murdered by then.
I heard the final survey is where big-shot gallery owners show up to troll for new talent.
I wouldn't worry about that too much right now.
This could be a big break for somebody.
But this is not Schwab's drugstore.
You are definitely not Lana Turner.
- What does that mean?
- It means you children are too young to be worrying about that.
Now, Eno, why haven't you been doing the assignments?
Frankly, I find them constricting and largely irrelevant.
My work has nothing to do with form or light or color but with questioning the nature of aesthetic experience.
I'll buy that.
- Jonah, what about you?
- I'll bring something next time.
Sorry.
I also heard that the student with the best grade gets a show at Broadway Bob's.
- That's been known to happen, yes.
Professor Okamura said no one in your class ever got the best grade.
Well, Larry seems to care about that kind of thing a lot more than I do.
And Larry has a tendency to live vicariously through his students which I find rather pathetic.
I also heard they're cutting faculty, and all the profs are shitting bricks trying to get a student to the Broadway Bob show.
Actually.
I'm too busy concentrating on my own painting to get involved with any kind of faculty intrigue.
Is it true Marvin Bushmiller got his break when he got the best grade?
Audrey.
Hi.
I just came in to get a coffee.
I have to model for Professor Bogle's class at 6:30.
Can I walk with you?
God, you're so polite.
Sure.
Look at you.
So content with your happy, little lives.
But none of you know the taste of true happiness the happiness that only death can bring.
I am hell on earth, personified!
What do you think?
Should I trim that last part?
How much longer you gonna be?
It's up to the boss.
See you later.
Hey, hey, hey.
You can't just leave.
What do you think of the movie so far?
- It's fine.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
She doesn't get this kind of stuff.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I gotta cram some love story into this thing, man.
Those skags make up 50 percent of the audience.
You're missing the best part.
Hey.
Now we're not gonna have any more official assignments in this class.
Last week, I asked you to bring in what you thought was your best work of art, old or new.
Okay?
And we're gonna use that work as a starting point to, hopefully, help you become better artists.
"We live in a police state."
Ain't that the truth.
This is interesting.
That's not finished, but I thought the class might find it interesting to see the various stages of my process.
Indeed.
And what have we here?
- Who did this?
- That's mine.
Where have you been all my life?
- What do we think of this work, class?
- It's so...
It's like, he figured out how to unlearn all the typical art school bullshit.
It's really great.
It has the singularity of outsider art, though the conscious rejection of spatial dynamics could only come from an intimacy with the conventions of picture-making.
Are you kidding me?
You look at?
Professor Okamura, what are some of your favorite Halloween memories?
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
You want a drink?
There's some weird orange punch over there.
- Yeah.
That's really sweet.
Thank you.
- Okay.
Better get back there.
You're about to get cock-blocked by Joe College.
How did you do that painting?
It's like you've never seen another painting before.
What the fuck?
My God, we look like Bonnie and Clyde.
Oh, thanks.
Isn't it weird?
Look how perfectly we match.
- That's great.
- There's an empty seat over there.
Looks like a duel.
No?
Comments?
Jonah's seems totally original and authentic.
And Jerome's just seems lame.
It's pathetic.
No offense.
Yeah, it's like Jonah is tapping into this total childhood innocence.
He's got a whole way of seeing that's completely outside the box.
And Jerome is totally in the box, you know?
- Yeah.
It sucks.
- You know, Jerome's is really...
Okay, I think that's fine.
We shouldn't be too hard on Jerome.
Jerome's trying to do something that is essentially impossible.
He's trying to sing in his own voice using someone else's vocal chords.
I mean, it's the greatest.
He picks a completely random victim.
I mean, this chick was, like...
She was, like, a cashier or something.
- How do they know it's the same guy?
- Come on, it's obvious.
There's a million clues.
For one thing, he always...
- Okay, I believe you.
- Look at her.
She was only 31 years old.
I mean, it's like a goddamn miracle.
Here I am, busting my nuts trying to find some female character for my movie and this guy goes and drops one right in my lap.
Murder?
Don't worry so much, man.
No one's gonna murder me.
I don't want nothing to happen to my best ho.
The streets ain't safe no more.
Not since...
Fuck you.
You're just trying to keep me down, and I am not your whore any more.
I mean...
I'm not your whore no more.
This is total shit, you know that?
No, I don't know that.
Come on.
All of this "gangsta," "motherfucker" bullshit.
Why do you wanna regurgitate this Hollywood crap for the zillionth time?
Don't you have anything original to say?
- I think I do.
- Then you need to say it.
Because this is completely worthless.
- Hello?
- Hi.
It's Jerome Platz.
- Hey, Jerome Platz.
- Hey, I was just calling...
To...
I've got...
I've gotta go home for Thanksgiving, and I was wondering if you had any plans, if, maybe, you wanted to come with me...
Unfortunately, I have to go up north to visit my grandmother.
- But that's really nice of you.
- No...
Don't be silly.
Have a great time.
I'll talk to you soon.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Take care.
Bye.
I think maybe I'll go on tour with Dominick's band this summer.
They're playing shows in the Midwest.
They need someone to sell T-shirts.
Who's Dominick?
This guy, who's friends with Stacy's big brother.
- Forget about it.
- God, you are so unfair.
Jerome gets to go to art school, and I can't go on a summer trip.
You gonna get a job doing paintings somewhere once school's done?
That's not really how it works.
Who in their right mind would buy your paintings?
- Cynthia.
- God, you love Jerome more than me.
You know what you gotta do?
Figure out who's the top guy in your business and hook up with him.
It's not what you do so much as who you know.
That's how it is in my business, and it's all about business.
Yeah.
Actually, I've kind of made a connection already.
My girlfriend's dad is kind of a famous artist, so...
- Your what?
- Hugh help me get the rest of the pies out of the oven?
We thought for sure you were a homo.
My friend's granddaughter paints little pictures on the shoes...
Oh, what do you call them?
Anyhow, she paints pictures of little animals and whatnot.
And I believe the other children pay her for it.
"Sneakers."
Isn't that what they call them?
Anyhow, that's something I thought you could do, Jeremy.
It's not that at all.
It's just that, I really felt that they were some of, really, the best things I'd done in a very long time.
And I'm just...
And I'm just slightly surprised that...
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
I'm Helena Sandiford.
Sandy will be right with you.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate...
No, I do.
I do understand.
No.
Not at all.
And I really appreciate you looking at the slides.
Yeah.
And you.
Bye.
Go fuck yourself, Lorenzo!
Those are mine, yes.
They're really good.
Yes, I rather like them.
Unfortunately, we're not in the majority, Jerome.
Apparently, they're a little too "difficult" for some people.
So how long have you been doing the triangles?
A long time.
I was one of the first.
So tell me, Jerome what are you not getting out of my class?
I don't know.
I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing and...
Maybe I should be finding my own style or voice or something.
That is absolute bullshit.
What would an artist at your age want with a style?
What about Jonah?
He's got sort of a style.
No, Jonah doesn't have a style.
He has a sort of "nowness."
It's exciting.
It's seductive.
But that does not mean, Jerome that he is a better artist than you are.
Far from it.
You're very similar to me.
It is going to take you a very long time to get where you're going.
Look, do you have any idea how long it took me to paint like this?
- No.
- Twenty-five years.
Jerome, it is absolutely essential at your age that you start to experiment with all the arts all the philosophies and all the lifestyles.
So, that's what you think I should do, is try a bunch of different styles and see where it takes me?
Yes, yes and yes, Jerome.
- Okay.
- I have seen so many young artists get locked into this incredibly rigid way of thinking.
So that's what I should try to do, is experiment?
Absolutely.
And I am here to facilitate that experimentation in any way I can either in or out of the classroom.
Thank you, professor.
For the last time, come on, get out.
Get out of my building.
He says they're all done.
We can go in now.
Too experimental.
You're all over the map.
No focus.
Hollow and derivative.
You need to be yourself.
What's up, Platz?
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are you going to Marvin Bushmiller's opening?
No.
I didn't even know about it.
It might be an invite-only thing.
It's probably done through his gallery.
- I'm sure it'll be a total drag, anyway.
- When is it?
I don't even know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I can't believe it.
I got an "A."
Everybody got an "A".
It's a total scam to trick everybody into feeling good about themselves.
Yeah, well, I never got better than a "C" in my whole life.
That's hard to believe.
Yeah, well, guess I didn't go to class too much.
- I was too busy getting into trouble.
- Really.
Yeah, me too.
No kidding.
Did you grow up in the city?
Well, not right in the city.
But I came here all the time.
All the fucking time.
Practically lived here.
So how about it, dude?
You got any deep, dark secrets we should know about?
Forgive me!
What the hell was that?
Don't worry, it's a totally rough cut.
That's a temp score without...
I thought you were gonna make a nice little murder picture but, here, you got the worms and the dancing...
- Did you like it?
- It's symbolism, Grandpa.
And where are the guns?
I thought this was a shoot-them-up.
The guy's a strangler, Grandpa.
What am I supposed to do?
I want guns.
The movie is called, The Strathmore Strangler.
You want the strangler to shoot people?
I paid for a movie with guns.
Hello, Torsiello Gallery.
I can put you on the pre-waiting list.
It's not working.
Do it better.
Excuse me.
We're closed.
I heard that Mr. Bushmiller was having a party tonight.
And I was just wondering if there was...
Sorry.
Invite only.
I was gonna make up some elaborate lie, but I decided to be honest.
I'm desperate.
I'm not crazy.
I won't even talk to Mr. Bushmiller.
You see how busy I am here?
Please.
Please.
Did you put any grenadine in this?
I'm new to this.
I'm sorry.
I'd like a Martell.
There you go.
I heard that Marvin needed some help, so I figured, why not?
I'll have a...
I'm just gonna take one of these.
Just a Bud is fine.
We have...
Hoegaarden or Stella Artois.
The first one.
You look pretty busy, so...
I drink Slivovitz, not Sambuca.
You were right about art.
It's all about the cock-sucking.
It's not what you do, but who you blow.
And even that's not enough.
You don't even have a chance, unless you're the most ruthless cold-blooded...
Jesus, I'm really sorry.
Have you heard about the great man's latest masterpiece?
- No.
- Some of his finest work, I believe.
Damn good stuff.
Who?
The murderer?
"The murderer"?
That's so disrespectful.
Got a few victims for him, if he's interested.
Do you wanna see my paintings?
This is my humble tribute to the great man.
He doesn't simply reproduce reality, like an ordinary idiot artist.
He courageously reshapes it to suit his own needs.
And why did our great artist select these particular victims?
Who can say?
A real artist knows when he's found his ideal subject.
Perhaps, this one was a dishonest cashier.
This one might have reminded him of a domineering aunt.
And this one...
Maybe he was just too stupid to be allowed to live.
All of humanity is too stupid to live.
Fuck them all.
My boy.
I say, you can't do anything really good until you truly don't care at all if you live or die.
Kill me right now.
I couldn't care less.
It's only when every human misery is just a big joke that you can finally get some enjoyment out of this life.
I wish someone would kill me right now.
- Do you want me to kill you?
- Go for it.
Well, I guess I'd better be going, before I throw up on your rug again.
Wait.
I wanna give you something.
- What's this?
- A gift, from me to you.
- No, I couldn't.
- You could.
You could.
Let's see some ID.
ID.
Are you drunk?
No.
Well, look who's here.
One of those.
Where the hell you been all week?
Been having a really hard time.
Yeah?
Well, you should just do what I always do.
Drop out, and start over again next semester.
This is my third time, soon to be my fourth.
You don't understand.
I'll never have another chance like this.
I can't just start over.
I'll never find another Audrey.
Don't start with this shit again.
Every artist needs a subject, and she's my perfect subject.
- I can't let her slip through my fingers.
- Hey, come on.
Let's rescue these art chicks.
That's easy pickings.
If I can just come up with something for that final survey she'll forget all about Jonah.
- We're gonna miss our chance here.
- I just need to think of something.
There they go.
What can I do?
You know, I think I just figured out who you are.
- Who?
- You're the class douche bag.
Thanks for the beer.
Oh, please.
You can't fall for every guy who does a halfway-decent painting.
I don't know.
There's something about him.
You don't need any more boyfriends, you need about 15 years of therapy.
I thought you were all mad for what's-his-name...
Jonah.
Look when this one doesn't work out you can always come crawling back to me.
So, looks like you finally got Jonah on the run.
- What do you mean?
- He was asking about some painting of yours.
You got a surprise for the final survey?
What do you want?
I need a big favor.
- I see you've come empty-handed.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
You must think I'm the cheapest whore in town.
I'll bring you a case of Slivovitz.
Whatever you want.
I just...
I wanna buy the rest of your paintings.
- They're not for sale.
- Please, just tell me what you want.
- I don't want anything.
- I'm just fucking lost...
- I thought you were an artist.
- I am.
I am.
You wanna be an artist or an "aficionado"?
An artist.
What do you think an artist cares about?
Does he think all day about fine wines and black-tie affairs and what he's gonna say at the next after-dinner speech?
No.
He lives only for that narcotic moment of creative bliss.
A moment that may come once a decade.
Or never at all.
You think I'm wrong?
Fuck you.
You know nothing at all about anything.
- Listen, I don't care about fine wines.
- Oh, I know what you want.
If it was me, I'd get my way by any means possible.
I'd grab them by the balls, and I'd never stop twisting.
Once you're on top, they're helpless.
You've got them squirming under the toe of your shoe.
Would you please put out that goddamn cigarette before you kill me with your awful smoke!
What about the paintings?
I don't care, do whatever you want.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.
I have a confession to make.
Yeah?
Forget it.
- No, what?
- Nothing.
Forget I said anything.
- What is it?
Some boyfriend problem?
- What?
Why?
- I don't know.
What is it?
- Why did you say that?
Do you think I'm gay?
- I don't know.
- Really?
Yeah.
Maybe a little, I guess.
Yeah.
Well, that's it.
That's my confession.
I think I'm gay.
Okay.
Okay.
I thought you said you were working.
I am working.
I gotta have this done for Monday.
It looks fine, Jonah.
It doesn't have to be perfect.
It's got a long way to go.
What's gotten into you?
When you were working Narcotics you didn't spend your off-hours smoking crack.
And what about your son?
He misses his daddy.
Will you get off my ass for once?
Lonny and the guys are here, or are you too busy for them?
Well, look who's here.
How's the Mona Lisa coming, Rembrandt?
You're off duty, Jonah.
You don't gotta dress like a fruitcake.
Yeah.
It's good to see you guys too.
How much longer is this gonna go on, Lonny?
I never see him anymore since he became an artist.
I'm just trying to do my job.
That's a good question, Marie.
So, what about it, superstar?
Hey, we got the blow-ups of the pictures you took.
He used the same colors we found on the glove of the first crime scene.
I don't know about this guy Platz.
He didn't live near the campus when the first killings took place.
He used to come to the city all the time.
He told me so himself.
It would've helped if you had taken a paint sample.
You can't just monkey around with a piece of art like that...
"Piece of shit" is more like it.
You take a look at this fucking thing?
Excuse me, Marie.
We can't even question this asshole?
It's like he's making fun of us.
I'm taking shit to this day about that first weirdo you dragged in.
I can't afford any more fuck-ups.
I need better shit than this, Jonah.
Listen to me, Gerry.
Will you listen to me?
Look...
I know you're a genius, but I'm a genius too.
What are you, on vacation?
Move your ass.
Look, this dyke is gonna make us both a fortune, I'm telling you.
I'm 100 percent on this one.
Fine.
Don't listen to me.
What do I care?
Don't you ever call me again, you ungrateful prick.
Excuse me?
I'm in your Tuesday/Thursday class.
Can I ask you a question?
So, there's this freshman survey tomorrow.
And you wanna know what you can do to land a big gallery contract like Marvin Bushmiller.
No.
Not exactly.
Perhaps you want a major retrospective at the Metropolitan?
Actually, there's someone who...
I don't know.
I want her to...
It's for a girl?
Yeah.
You wanna take the prize so you can win the heart of a girl?
Yeah.
That's so exciting.
Think you could look at my paintings and tell me if they're good enough?
No.
But I'll be rooting for you.
Hey.
Think Jonah's getting any gash on the side?
No.
Marie's got him so pussy-whipped it's not even funny.
Hey, hey.
That's our guy.
That's our guy, right there.
Will you look at him.
I ought to wring his neck right now.
- What the fuck are we waiting for?
- He couldn't strangle a cat.
Fucking scumbag!
Where the fuck is Jonah?
Lonny told him to be on the guy's ass.
Jesus, that was disappointing.
Who are you trying to fool with that badass stuff?
All that murder shit?
Totally September 10th, Jerome.
Jerome...
Have you seen Jonah?
No.
Don't despair, okay?
You call me over the break, and we'll get you right back on track.
Okay?
Okay, you win.
It's all yours, so live it up.
- Jerome...
- You're the one out of 100 that goes on to fame and fortune.
I'm just another deluded asshole.
- These paintings...
- Fuck those paintings, and fuck you.
You have everybody fooled, but not me.
You came up with a good gimmick, your tough-guy, Joe Normal act but your paintings are fucking bullshit, and you know it.
Well I still kicked your ass, didn't I?
Jonah, come on.
Where you been?
We gotta go.
Jerome, wait here.
I wanna talk to you.
You have to meet your public.
Marvelous work, Jonah.
Good job, Jonah.
Building burned up.
Everybody died.
Some asshole didn't put out his cigarette.
This is it.
What the fuck, Jonah.
Mikey, get your ass over here.
Where's Jonah?
So?
What?
This fucking nobody is gonna stand me up?
I gave him the message, Mr. D'Annunzio.
Hey, come on.
Bob hates people being late.
I really gotta find Jerome.
Come on.
Don't shoot me, man!
Don't shoot!
Police!
Get down on the ground!
Face down!
Cut!
What are you doing, asshole, you ruined my best take!
My arm...
I think my arm is broken.
Well, that's great!
What in fuck's name do I do now?
Hey!
Where have you been?
What the hell is this?
What is this nonsense?
Let's go, hotshot.
Chief wants you right now, come on.
What are you thinking, huh?
You paying attention to me?
God, I'm a fucking idiot.
Did you see a portrait of me?
A really beautiful...
It was right here.
I chucked everything out back.
Police!
Open the door!
I got a warrant!
Police!
Don't try anything!
- Oh, Jesus.
- This isn't what you think.
- Jerome Platz!
- Jerome Platz!
Jerome Platz!
You in there?
- Jerome Platz!
- Hey, Jerome Platz!
Audrey, I know you don't care about me but maybe someday you'll...
Excuse me.
Police business.
Clear the way, please.
Excuse me.
Are we gonna have a problem?
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.
Go draw something, will you?
Lonny, I'm sorry.
I know I let personal things get in the way of my job but it'll never happen again.
- Superstar, we got him.
- All's well that ends well, okay?
- Hey, Jonah.
You suck!
Have a nice death, pig.
You wanna spit at us again?
I will take you down so fast, you got no idea, you fucking freak.
Mikey, let's clear it up and get out of here.
- Kevin, you wanna ride with him?
- Let me do it, Lonny.
- Yeah, you fucking pig!
- Fucking pig!
Well, I knew there was something weird about you.
What did you really think about my?
Did you think my paintings were any good at all?
- Yeah, maybe.
- I could have made it as an artist?
No, I don't know about that.
Hey.
So are you really the guy?
Jerome, look over here!
Let me get a picture!
Jerome!
Jerome.
Visiting hours.
Should we judge an artist by what he does in his personal life?
If he's an anti-Semite, like T.S. Eliot or a bully, like Picasso or in this case, a murderer should his art have any less value?
I think not.
Look, if I wanna have a showing of this artist's work nobody has any right to stop me.
I'm fighting for First Amendment rights.
You're with me or you're a fucking Nazi, as far as I'm concerned.
What?
Why can't I say that?
We didn't even know it was a documentary at first, but then you know, it just sort of all came together.
I mean, that's the way I like to work.
Finding my way as I go along.
No, I don't think I'd ever sell it.
Jerome was always so passionate about his art.
It's really unfortunate what happened but, I mean, I always knew he'd be a famous artist someday.
I just wanna do what's best for my client.
Why don't you trust Jerome to know what's best?
And what's best for Jerome is to stay for as long as possible followed by a lengthy trial.
I have more than enough evidence to get him out.
- This case should not even go to trial.
- Where the fuck did they find you?
Jerome needs a lawyer who understands what to do when a situation like this presents itself.
I am very close to the family.
I went to school with Hugh Platz.
That's real nice.
Now, look...
You know how many paintings I can sell for your client while this is going on?
Jerome.
How's my boy?
- How's the work coming?
- It's fine.
Can't believe how many people are calling about you.
- I had to cut off the waiting list.
- Great.
Jerome, I just wanna let you know if you change your mind, we can get you out of here.
I know, I know.
But we've been through all this.
Are these my only visitors?
Jerome, you get a chance to call the guy from Artforum?
He wants to talk.
Also, did you take a moment to look at those papers?
I need you to sign the yellow one.
Keep your chin up, Jerome.
We all love you.
- All right.
- I'll call you tonight.
Hi.
Hey.
- Can we go now?
- Cut.
I am a genius.
I am the greatest artist of the 20th century.
My name is Pablo Picasso.
I pretty much invented modern art.
And I do weird, abstract paintings... ..even though I can paint totally realistic, if I wanted to.
Also, even though I'm super short and bald... ..I am able to have sex with any beautiful woman I want... ..just because I'm so great.
Come here.
Look.
- Pretty good.
- Thanks.
Some day, if you get famous, this can be worth a lot of money.
You're wasting your time, Jerome.
You gotta set your sights on a more realistic girl.
Shit, here comes Stoob.
Hey, pencil-prick, thanks for helping me with that poster for Erikson's class.
- He said I was a natural artist.
- A natural scam artist.
Got that right, queer-bait.
What's this?
- Are you jacking off in school now?
- It's a college brochure, you moron.
What college has a naked chick for a teacher?
She's an art model, you stupid ape.
Hey.
You're all right, Platz.
I don't know, Jerome.
It just seems a little too good to be true.
Don't you think?
Fucking shit!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's based on the whole thing with the campus murder, but-
Hell no, it ain't no boring-ass documentary.
Look, forget that shit, okay?
Yeah, fucking A, there's gonna be tons of action, are you kidding me?
- You're an art major?
- Yeah.
Drawing and painting.
- What are you guys?
- I'm fashion.
He's film, I guess.
Are you for real?
You're shitting me, right?
- Well, yeah.
- God, this is so depressing.
- Why, what's wrong?
- I just really, really miss my girlfriend.
One hundred percent.
Yeah, you won't be sorry.
I love you too, Grandpa.
Yes!
Yes!
I'm so fucking pumped!
- I'm Vince.
- Hi.
Jerome.
How are you?
- What's your name again?
- Matthew.
God, I'm so fucking jazzed.
I get to make my movie.
That's fantastic.
- You guys freshmen?
- Yeah.
- You a sophomore?
- Junior.
It's all right.
You listen to me, you'll be okay.
Why do you still live in the dorm?
A lot of juniors still live in the dorm.
What's wrong with that?
That guy's some hot shit sculpture major.
I have never seen so many beautiful girls.
This is nothing.
Dude, you should've seen last year's crop.
Enrollment's way off since the murders.
- What murders?
- You're shitting me, right?
I heard about it.
Somebody killed a guy on campus, or whatever.
Yeah.
Three people in the neighborhood since March.
You're fucking with me.
You've never heard about the Strathmore Strangler?
He killed a guy, like, 10 days ago.
- Are you from out of state?
- The suburbs.
Then you have no excuse.
What about Richard Natwick?
- Jesus.
- Sorry, I don't really follow the news.
Okay, I'm gonna give you the story- You gotta pay attention.
Because this story is huge.
This is, like, national news, man.
I'm listening.
Just after the first murder, there's this guy, Richard Natwick.
He's, like, some second-year painting major.
Does these stupid-ass word paintings.
He has a show at the student center.
Cops send some guys to check it out.
But they're not used to this kind of artsy bullshit, right?
- Fucking-
- Cut your shit.
Get used to being bent over, prick.
So then a couple of professors freak out.
And before you know it, he's like a fucking martyr.
Art is not a crime!
Art is not a crime!
Of course, it turns out he's completely innocent.
And the cops have to totally eat shit.
- So, what happened to him?
- He had his 15 minutes of fame.
Then he got hurt real bad in some crazy-ass performance art thing.
Okay... ..hit the juice.
Anyway, you gotta read my script.
I mean, it's all in there.
It's totally huge.
So, what, you don't get the paper in the suburbs?
I mean, for all they know, the killer could be from the suburbs.
Those cops, they don't know shit.
So, what, you're a drawing major?
Yeah.
Drawing and painting.
That's awesome.
I hear you guys get to see tons of naked vagina.
Okay, Leslie.
Time to work your magic.
First pose, people.
We're gonna hit the ground running.
Okay, first pose.
I don't have any particular wisdom to impart to you people, except this:
These four words:
Don't have unrealistic expectations.
If you wanna make money, better drop out right now.
Go to banking school or website school.
Anywhere but art school.
And remember, only one out of 100 of you... ..will ever make a living as an artist.
Hello?
Yes.
Ah, Lorenzo.
No.
Absolutely, yes-
Sandy, can I get a break up here?
Take a break.
Five minutes.
Are you kidding?
I would absolutely love to have you look at it.
No, because I feel like I've really turned a corner with this latest series.
In January?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sure I could.
I mean, I don't think my plate is completely full.
Well, I'd be happy...
No, of course not.
Hi.
- Really pretty, what you're doing.
- I gotta go.
Jesus.
Why are the people in these freshman classes exactly the same every year?
Look.
You got the vegan holy man.
The boring blowhard.
- The angry lesbian.
- Professor?
Professor?
Professor?
And here, you got kiss-ass.
I wanted to tell you that I looked up some of your paintings on the Internet.
- I thought they were really terrific.
- You get an "A" for the class.
And Mom.
I feel that I am finally about to ripen.
Artistically.
Mom's youngest just left the nest... ..so she's ready to explore her creative side.
How do you know all this stuff?
Because I'm a living cliché just like the rest of these guys.
I'm the guy who keeps dropping out and changing majors... ..because he's afraid he really sucks at everything.
So who am I?
I don't know.
I haven't figured you out yet.
Jesus.
Who's the weirdo?
Professor?
Professor?
Professor Okamura?
What is your attendance policy for this class?
I... ..don't... ..care...
..if you come to class or not.
This is ready for the kiln.
Let me see if I got this right:
You're the guy that never got laid in high school.
So you came here to try to bone your way through... ..an endless lineup of art skanks.
Not exactly.
I mean, I really do wanna be an artist.
A great artist, you know, if possible.
Which enables you to bone your way through a lineup of art skanks.
So why wait, man?
Art school's like a pussy buffet.
I don't want just any girl.
All right.
There she is.
There is the beautiful beatnik art chick of your dreams.
- Yeah, so?
- So ask her to borrow something.
It's the easiest thing in the world.
Want me to teach you?
Daddy will bring you there.
- Jesus...
- Come on.
Hi...
Do you think I could borrow your pencil?
Why?
- What for?
- Doesn't matter, it was a stupid idea.
Oh, my God.
You have the most beautiful eyes.
You have to let me take a picture of them.
Okay.
How about pizza?
Do you wanna go get pizza?
The only trouble with that is all those beatnik chicks are totally insane.
Look, what you really want is a nice, innocent, suburban girl.
Some freshman chick who hasn't been corrupted yet.
Stay out of that cave, Koala Bear.
There's snakes and bats.
Don't be silly, Pepper.
I'm not afraid of a little snake.
You know, come to think of it, they're all insane.
Just find yourself some nympho slut and get it over with.
Excuse me.
Can you help me get this off?
I want you to know, I definitely don't have AIDS.
I've been tested, like, 40 times, so I know it for a fact.
Keep the fucking kid quiet, you motherfucking asshole!
It's just my old man.
Are you serious?
You've never been laid before?
It just hasn't worked out yet.
I have very high standards.
Man, I gotta take you out whore-busting some night.
We gotta remedy this situation before it gets any worse.
Maybe you have issues that make it difficult... ..to feel comfortable with your own sexuality.
Could be, I guess.
You guys know what whore-busting is, right?
You leave the money on the dresser, fuck the whore and go to sleep.
You wake up, not only is your money still there, but she's left you a tip.
It's the fucking greatest deal ever, man.
Crackheads aren't so good.
Their tip is a little glass pipe and a piece of tinfoil.
You don't want that shit.
Get a nice call girl or something, you know?
You fuck a lot of chicks, Matthew?
Yeah, I figured, man.
Fashion, and all that shit.
Models...
Crack whores, call girls, strippers...
We could bust some strippers together, that'd be fucking awesome.
What is art?
Is this art?
Or this?
Or this?
Who's that?
Ignore that.
That's a mistake.
Hamlet.
War and Peace.
"Beethoven's 9th".
Guernica.
These are works which hold as much emotional resonance today... ..as they did at the time of their creation.
What makes a work of art timeless?
What qualities must it possess?
- Yes?
- Everything on your list... ..was done by a dead white male.
I noticed that too.
To be clear, they were not yet dead when they created those works.
You're just playing into the patriarchy.
The history of art is largely about the implementation of masculinity.
- That is such bullshit.
- Part of some Darwinian imperative.
Most artists become artists because... ..they have no way to attract a mate.
I hardly think I'm the first to point out... ..that the vast preponderance of artists are, shall we say... ..physiologically deficient in some way.
Dribble the ball, Hurst!
Please don't yell.
- Going to Marvin Bushmiller's talk?
- Yeah, are you?
We better get there early.
It's weird how he's so famous.
I used to see him around Strathmore when I was a freshman.
I saw his show at Broadway Bob's now he's on the cover of Artforum.
- Well, that's how it works.
- Platz!
Get in there.
Mr. Bushmiller, The New York Times has called your work:
"An expedition to the far contours of an evolving techno-culture. "
With that in mind, where do you see art headed in the 21 st century?
"Art" who?
No, really, that's such... ..a stupid question.
Why don't you ask me something relevant.
Ask me how much money I have in the bank, or...
Did you learn anything at Strathmore?
Yes, I learned many things.
I learned that the faculty is made up of old failures... ..who teach only because they need the health insurance.
Present company excluded, of course.
I was about to say.
David was too busy trolling the halls for fresh meat to worry about health.
What advice would you give to a young artist-
Shut up.
There's only one question any of you wanna ask.
You wanna know what it would take to turn you into me.
Well, listen closely, because I'm gonna give you the answer.
In order to be a great artist... ..you simply have to be a great artist.
There's nothing to learn, so you're all wasting your time.
Go home.
Why are you such an asshole?
Now, that's a great question.
No, it really is.
I am an asshole because that is my true nature.
Maybe it's everybody's true nature.
Every one of you looks like a fucking asshole, but who knows?
The difference between you and me is that... ..I have gained the freedom to express my true nature.
And what could be more beautiful than truth and freedom?
Another day, another dollar.
Hello, Larry.
Oh, by the way... ..are you and Lois gonna be free the night of January 18th?
How the hell should I know?
Well, I have to do this little gallery thing.
Lorenzo Massengale has been torturing me... ..to put my new series of paintings in his new space... ..and I just thought maybe you and Lois would want an invitation.
I think I'm busy that night, Sandiford.
Here, I stopped off at Broadway Bob's.
You're welcome.
I thought Broadway Bob's was an art gallery or something.
It's a very famous shithole run by an obnoxious windbag... ..who takes credit for the career of every half-talented monkey... ..who ever took a class at Strathmore.
But the coffee's good.
Hello, Lorenzo, it's Sandy.
Just wanted to make sure you got the slides and...
You don't need to call me, because I have a class starting.
So I will call you afterwards.
Thanks.
Bye.
Sorry I'm late.
Hello, dear.
Looks like this is our lucky day.
I'm sorry, Sandy, I'm just dying for a cigarette.
Yes, absolutely.
Five-minute break.
I'm gonna go to the john.
Let me borrow this.
All right.
She smiled at you, how sweet.
You've seen her before?
Who is she?
Don't get your hopes up.
She's prime real estate, my friend.
Hey, faggots.
What a cute couple.
I think they like us.
- Is she a student or just a model?
- Can we forget about her for a minute?
We're about to have a life-changing experience here.
Jimmy, it's Bardo.
Brought someone over to meet you.
I got a bottle of Slivovitz here.
It's 80 proof, made in Poland, imported by-
Boys, welcome.
I'm afraid you've interrupted me in the middle of one of my shows.
This is Jerome.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thank you for having us.
A pleasure.
Isn't this a great place?
Jimmy's got rent control.
So Jerome here... ..wants to be a great artist, Jimmy.
How terrific.
Jerome, are you exceptionally skilled as a cocksucker?
It wasn't a rhetorical question.
Are you a great artist when it comes to fellatio?
No.
No, I guess not.
Well, that's no good.
So who do you like?
Who's your favorite artist, Jerome?
- Maybe Picasso.
- I see.
Very good.
Our old friend... .."pick-asshole. "
The nasty little dwarf who went his whole life... ..without a single original thought.
I presume you're joking, right?
Jimmy's a Strathmore grad.
Just look at me now.
Just think, Jerome.
One day, this could all be yours.
You're going places, young man.
I can feel it.
But you need to take some lessons in sucking cock and licking ass.
Otherwise, you might find yourself rotting away in some shithole... ..postponing suicide for the slim chance that you might one day... ..possibly see some glorious plague or pestilence... ..bring horrible suffering to your hateful species.
What are you smiling about?
Laugh away, laughing boy!
I will stomp your guts till they shoot out your ass!
I will bury you alive and shit on your grave!
Okay, boys.
Show's over.
I have to get back to my masturbation.
Isn't Jimmy great?
Yeah, definitely.
Self-portrait.
Starting next week... ..I will be selecting the most effective work from each session... ..and placing it in the hall gallery.
- Which gallery?
- It's on this floor.
- Down at the end of the hall.
- By the men's toilet?
Yes.
Now, let's get started on these.
Who wants to comment?
I like Flower's drawing.
- Yeah.
Me too.
- It seems like she's trying to do... ..something more than just draw herself.
It's more about the process of drawing.
All right.
Does anything else up here command your attention?
Does anyone have anything more to say on Flower's piece?
Yes, Jerome?
- Nothing.
- Well, "nothing" doesn't exist... ..in this classroom.
What are you thinking?
We're waiting, Jerome.
I don't know.
It just-
It looks like a lame Cy Twombly imitation to me.
It looks like she did it in about two minutes.
That is such bullshit.
Because her drawing isn't perfect, it's automatically bad?
At least it has humanity.
Yeah, totally.
Jerome, your drawing looks like it was done by a machine.
Whereas Flower's...
Flower's is full of playfulness and...
Yeah, like, humanity.
What's so great about humanity?
Humans are a bunch of jerks.
I hope a plague wipes out the species.
- What is your problem?
- Jesus Christ, Jerome.
Okay, that's enough.
This is a required assignment.
I have to give it to you.
And, Flower, it is certainly not worth crying about, okay?
Hey, man.
I agree with you 100 percent.
I think the entire human race should be wiped off the face of the earth.
Oh, I didn't really mean
- I was just-
You don't have to apologize.
I'm totally with you on this.
So this is the hall gallery.
Hey.
You guys have to come to my opening tonight.
You were really an asshole in class today.
Hey.
You guys.
So are we gonna go see Shilo's opening?
- How did she ever get a gallery show?
- It's totally meaningless.
Any idiot could sign up for a student gallery.
Oh, my God.
What?
I didn't notice that.
We gotta go.
Great work, Shilo.
Hey.
Do you know this girl?
Yeah.
We had her as a model.
Remember?
But do you know who she is?
Do you know her name?
You are such a prick.
What?
You can't say anything nice about my photos?
- Hi.
- Hi.
That came out really good.
- Thank you.
- Shilo.
What?
Oh, hi.
I'm Audrey, by the way.
So is that your real name?
Or are you just obsessed with Audrey Hepburn like every art school chick?
I was named after an old cartoon.
Another ironic pop culture reference.
She's a keeper.
- Hey.
- God, do you know that guy?
- No.
I thought he was your friend.
- No way.
Oh, you're the guy from Sandy's class.
I have such a bad memory for faces.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I'm Jerome.
I was thinking about you today.
I saw an old photo of Marie-Thérèse Walter... ..and it looked just like the way that you drew me.
She's one of the women who modeled for Picasso.
I know just the picture you're talking about.
You do?
Let's get out of here.
What?
I said I liked your photos.
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's okay.
I couldn't bear to watch you get cornered by that creep again.
Well, I have to get going anyway.
I'm kind of making the rounds tonight.
Really?
Well, maybe sometime we could-
I have to go to a Donald Baumgarten show.
Oh, I know who he is.
He's an old pop art guy, right?
Yeah, he's really good.
He's great.
He's absolutely awful.
But I can't get out of it.
Do you wanna go with me?
Come on, please.
I hate to take the subway by myself.
Especially with that weirdo out there strangling everybody.
A little bit.
Well, my parents go a lot.
Hi.
Audrey, I was afraid you weren't coming.
So how's it going?
Well, I think I might have sold two of the small ones.
- The ones you hate.
- I like them just fine.
You know that.
Just not as much as the big, blue ones.
I know.
Daddy, this is Jerome.
Jerome is a big fan of yours.
I brought him to meet you.
Jerome, this is Donald Baumgarten.
Wow.
I'm a big fan of yours, sir.
It's really a pleasure.
My pleasure, son.
Daddy, I hate to do this, but I don't think we can stay.
Jerome has to meet someone at another party, and we're late, so-
- Will I see you on Sunday?
- I'll call you.
I can't believe you grew up with a dad like that.
He's a famous artist.
He's hardly a famous artist.
It's really heartbreaking.
He should've given up, like, 30 years ago.
God, I am starving.
- Should we go eat somewhere?
- Sure.
Have you ever heard of Broadway Bob's?
So why are you a model?
Just for the money?
Oh, yeah.
I make a fortune.
My God, is that who I think it is?
He's always here.
That table is practically reserved for post-minimalists.
This is where everybody gets their first big show.
It's like the launching pad from Strathmore to the real world.
- How do they pick who gets a show?
- They go to the surveys and all that.
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?
When's the last time you came to see me?
Jerome, this is Broadway Bob.
- How you doing?
- Hi.
Bob knows everybody.
Every artist you can think of had their first show in this place.
Bushmiller, Naugle, Bilbo, you name it.
The minute they get famous, they got no time for me, right?
Hey!
I told you to stop hassling my customers!
Hector!
Fucking Brown Shirts.
What are you doing?
- Good to see you.
- Bye.
- Tell your father I said hi.
- Okay.
- Hey.
Excuse me.
- Yeah, what?
You wanna help me out?
I got two homeless fucks outside... ..that panhandle all day.
They bother my customers outside.
This kid's not a serial killer.
Look at that guy out there.
- Just get the fuck out.
- All right, let's go.
- Your coffee sucks.
- Go to Starbucks.
Who's this?
- Jerome, this is Candace.
- Hi, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
Audrey and I used to bump cunts.
Just kidding.
But little Audrey doesn't wanna play with me anymore, does she.
What do you think of these paintings?
They're okay.
I mean, they're not the most-
They're Candace's paintings.
- They're really good.
- Where do you find them, Audrey?
Anyway, thanks to this little exhibit, I'll get a spring show at the Haberman.
- That's really great.
Congratulations.
- I know.
Golly gosh!
- You.
Get over here.
- Later, kids.
What's this I hear about a show at Haberman?
You gotta let me know...
So, what do you wanna do, Jerome?
I wanna be the greatest artist of the 21 st century.
Oh, I just meant, "What do you wanna do now?"
I should probably get home.
- I'm stupid-
- No, no, I think it's great.
I think you really could be a great artist.
You have the right kind of... ..energy.
- You won't believe-
- Did you hear the news?
- No, but guess where I was?
- The strangler got another one.
Some poor schmuck on his way to the subway.
I got a major rewrite to do.
- I was on the subway tonight.
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Anyway, guess what I was doing.
- Smoking pole?
No, I was on a date with the most beautiful girl in the whole school.
All right.
Can I smell your finger?
Look.
No shit.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
She thinks I'm a great artist.
You fucking snake.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Did you already pop her?
No, I...
- You know, we just met-
- Man, if she was my girlfriend... ..I would be pounding that shit day and night.
November 28th.
November 28th.
Try and keep that date... ..in your tiny, little, drug-addled brains.
That is the date of the post-Thanksgiving assessment... ..where you'll put up all your work... ..and a bunch of us professors are gonna sneak in... ..behind your backs and give you a grade.
However, that is but a mere prelude to this day:
December 19th.
December 19th is the final survey where you will receive... ..your one-and-only official grade for this class... ..provided, of course, you all haven't been murdered by then.
I heard the final survey is where big-shot gallery owners... ..show up to troll for new talent.
I wouldn't worry about that too much right now.
This could be a big break for somebody.
But this is not Schwab's drugstore.
You are definitely not Lana Turner.
- What does that mean?
- It means you children are too young... ..to be worrying about that.
Now, Eno, why haven't you been doing the assignments?
Frankly, I find them constricting and largely irrelevant.
My work has nothing to do with form or light or color... ..but with questioning the nature of aesthetic experience.
I'll buy that.
- Jonah, what about you?
- I'll bring something next time.
Sorry.
I also heard that the student with the best grade...
- ... gets a show at Broadway Bob's.
- That's been known to happen, yes.
Professor Okamura said no one in your class ever got the best grade.
Well, Larry seems to care about that kind of thing a lot more than I do.
And Larry has a tendency to live vicariously through his students... ..which I find rather pathetic.
I also heard they're cutting faculty, and all the profs... ..are shitting bricks trying to get a student to the Broadway Bob show.
Actually.
I'm too busy concentrating on my own painting... ..to get involved with any kind of faculty intrigue.
Is it true Marvin Bushmiller got his break when he got the best grade?
Audrey.
Hi.
I just came in to get a coffee.
I have to model for Professor Bogle's class at 6:30.
Can I walk with you?
God, you're so polite.
Sure.
Look at you.
So content with your happy, little lives.
But none of you know the taste of true happiness the happiness that only death can bring.
I am hell on earth, personified!
What do you think?
Should I trim that last part?
How much longer you gonna be?
It's up to the boss.
See you later.
Hey, hey, hey.
You can't just leave.
What do you think of the movie so far?
- It's fine.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
She doesn't get this kind of stuff.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I gotta cram some love story into this thing, man.
Those skags make up 50 percent of the audience.
You're missing the best part.
Hey.
Now... ..we're not gonna have any more official assignments in this class.
Last week, I asked you to bring in what you thought was your... ..best work of art, old or new.
Okay?
And we're gonna use that work... ..as a starting point to, hopefully, help you become better artists.
"We live in a police state. "
Ain't that the truth.
This is interesting.
That's not finished, but I thought the class might find it interesting... ..to see the various stages of my process.
Indeed.
And what have we here?
- Who did this?
- That's mine.
Where have you been all my life?
- What do we think of this work, class?
- It's so...
It's like, he figured out how to unlearn all the typical art school bullshit.
It's really great.
It has the singularity of outsider art, though the conscious rejection... ..of spatial dynamics could only come from an intimacy... ..with the conventions of picture-making.
Are you kidding me?
You look at-?
Professor Okamura, what are some of your favorite Halloween memories?
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
You want a drink?
There's some weird orange punch over there.
- Yeah.
That's really sweet.
Thank you.
- Okay.
Better get back there.
You're about to get cock-blocked by Joe College.
How did you do that painting?
It's like you've never seen another painting before.
What the fuck?
My God, we look like Bonnie and Clyde.
Oh, thanks.
Isn't it weird?
Look how perfectly we match.
- That's great.
- There's an empty seat over there.
Looks like a duel.
No?
Comments?
Jonah's seems totally original and authentic.
And Jerome's just seems lame.
It's pathetic.
No offense.
Yeah, it's like Jonah is tapping... ..into this total childhood innocence.
He's got a whole way of seeing that's completely outside the box.
And Jerome is totally in the box, you know?
- Yeah.
It sucks.
- You know, Jerome's is really-
Okay, I think that's fine.
We shouldn't be too hard on Jerome.
Jerome's trying to do something that is essentially impossible.
He's trying to sing in his own voice... ..using someone else's vocal chords.
I mean, it's the greatest.
He picks a completely random victim.
I mean, this chick was, like...
She was, like, a cashier or something.
- How do they know it's the same guy?
- Come on, it's obvious.
There's a million clues.
For one thing, he always-
- Okay, I believe you.
- Look at her.
She was only 31 years old.
I mean, it's like a goddamn miracle.
Here I am, busting my nuts... ..trying to find some female character for my movie... ..and this guy goes and drops one right in my lap.
Murder?
Don't worry so much, man.
No one's gonna murder me.
I don't want nothing to happen to my best ho.
The streets ain't safe no more.
Not since-
Fuck you.
You're just trying to keep me down, and I am not your whore any more.
I mean...
I'm not your whore no more.
This is total shit, you know that?
No, I don't know that.
Come on.
All of this "gangsta," "motherfucker" bullshit.
Why do you wanna regurgitate this Hollywood crap for the zillionth time?
Don't you have anything original to say?
- I think I do.
- Then you need to say it.
Because this is completely worthless.
- Hello?
- Hi.
It's Jerome Platz.
- Hey, Jerome Platz.
- Hey, I was just calling...
To
- I've got-
I've gotta go home for Thanksgiving, and I was wondering... ..if you had any plans, if, maybe, you wanted to come with me...
Unfortunately, I have to go up north to visit my grandmother.
- But that's really nice of you.
- No...
Don't be silly.
Have a great time.
I'll talk to you soon.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Take care.
Bye.
I think maybe I'll go on tour with Dominick's band this summer.
They're playing shows in the Midwest.
They need someone to sell T-shirts.
Who's Dominick?
This guy, who's friends with Stacy's big brother.
- Forget about it.
- God, you are so unfair.
Jerome gets to go to art school, and I can't go on a summer trip.
You gonna get a job doing paintings somewhere once school's done?
That's not really how it works.
Who in their right mind would buy your paintings?
- Cynthia.
- God, you love Jerome more than me.
You know what you gotta do?
Figure out who's the top guy in your business and hook up with him.
It's not what you do so much as who you know.
That's how it is in my business, and it's all about business.
Yeah.
Actually, I've kind of made a connection already.
My girlfriend's dad is kind of a famous artist, so...
- Your what?
- Hugh... ..help me get the rest of the pies out of the oven?
We thought for sure you were a homo.
My friend's granddaughter paints little pictures on the shoes-
Oh, what do you call them?
Anyhow, she paints pictures of little animals and whatnot.
And I believe the other children pay her for it.
"Sneakers. "
Isn't that what they call them?
Anyhow, that's something I thought you could do, Jeremy.
It's not that at all.
It's just that, I really felt that they were... ..some of, really, the best things I'd done in a very long time.
And I'm just...
And I'm just slightly... ..surprised that...
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
I'm Helena Sandiford.
Sandy will be right with you.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate-
No, I do.
I do understand.
No.
Not at all.
And I really appreciate you looking at the slides.
Yeah.
And you.
Bye.
Go fuck yourself, Lorenzo!
Those are mine, yes.
They're really good.
Yes, I rather like them.
Unfortunately, we're not in the majority, Jerome.
Apparently, they're a little too "difficult" for some people.
So how long have you been doing the triangles?
A long time.
I was one of the first.
So tell me, Jerome... ..what are you not getting out of my class?
I don't know.
I feel like... ..I don't really know what I'm doing and...
Maybe I should be finding my own style... ..or voice or something.
That is absolute bullshit.
What would an artist at your age want with a style?
What about Jonah?
He's got sort of a style.
No, Jonah doesn't have a style.
He has a sort of "nowness. "
It's exciting.
It's seductive.
But that does not mean, Jerome... ..that he is a better artist than you are.
Far from it.
You're very similar to me.
It is going to take you a very long time... ..to get where you're going.
Look, do you have any idea... ..how long it took me to paint like this?
- No.
- Twenty-five years.
Jerome, it is absolutely essential at your age... ..that you start to experiment with all the arts... ..all the philosophies and all the lifestyles.
So, that's what you think I should do, is try a bunch of different styles... ..and see where it takes me?
Yes, yes and yes, Jerome.
- Okay.
- I have seen so many young artists... ..get locked into this incredibly rigid way of thinking.
So that's what I should try to do, is experiment?
Absolutely.
And I am here to facilitate that experimentation... ..in any way I can... ..either in or out of the classroom.
Thank you, professor.
For the last time, come on, get out.
Get out of my building.
He says they're all done.
We can go in now.
Too experimental.
You're all over the map.
No focus.
Hollow and derivative.
You need to be yourself.
What's up, Platz?
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are you going to Marvin Bushmiller's opening?
No.
I didn't even know about it.
It might be an invite-only thing.
It's probably done through his gallery.
- I'm sure it'll be a total drag, anyway.
- When is it?
I don't even know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I can't believe it.
I got an "A."
Everybody got an "A".
It's a total scam to trick everybody into feeling good about themselves.
Yeah, well, I never got better than a "C" in my whole life.
That's hard to believe.
Yeah, well, guess I didn't go to class too much.
- I was too busy getting into trouble.
- Really.
Yeah, me too.
No kidding.
Did you grow up in the city?
Well, not right in the city.
But I came here all the time.
All the fucking time.
Practically lived here.
So... ..how about it, dude?
You got any deep, dark secrets we should know about?
Forgive me!
What the hell was that?
Don't worry, it's a totally rough cut.
That's a temp score without-
I thought you were gonna make a nice little murder picture... ..but, here, you got the worms and the dancing...
- Did you like it?
- It's symbolism, Grandpa.
And where are the guns?
I thought this was a shoot-them-up.
The guy's a strangler, Grandpa.
What am I supposed to do?
I want guns.
The movie is called, The Strathmore Strangler.
You want the strangler to shoot people?
I paid for a movie with guns.
Hello, Torsiello Gallery.
I can put you on the pre-waiting list.
It's not working.
Do it better.
Excuse me.
We're closed.
I heard that Mr. Bushmiller was having a party tonight.
And I was just wondering if there was-
Sorry.
Invite only.
I was gonna make up some elaborate lie, but I decided to be honest.
I'm desperate.
I'm not crazy.
I won't even talk to Mr. Bushmiller.
You see how busy I am here?
Please.
Please.
Did you put any grenadine in this?
I'm new to this.
I'm sorry.
I'd like a Martell.
There you go.
I heard that Marvin needed some help, so I figured, why not?
I'll have a...
I'm just gonna take one of these.
Just a Bud is fine.
We have...
Hoegaarden... ..or Stella Artois.
The first one.
You look pretty busy, so...
I drink Slivovitz, not Sambuca.
You were right about art.
It's all about the cock-sucking.
It's not what you do, but who you blow.
And even that's not enough.
You don't even have a chance, unless you're the most ruthless... ..cold-blooded...
Jesus, I'm really sorry.
Have you heard about the great man's latest masterpiece?
- No.
- Some of his finest work, I believe.
Damn good stuff.
Who?
The murderer?
"The murderer"?
That's so disrespectful.
Got a few victims for him, if he's interested.
Do you wanna see my paintings?
This is my humble tribute to the great man.
He doesn't simply reproduce reality, like an ordinary idiot artist.
He courageously reshapes it to suit his own needs.
And why did our great artist select these particular victims?
Who can say?
A real artist knows when he's found his ideal subject.
Perhaps, this one was a dishonest cashier.
This one might have reminded him of a domineering aunt.
And this one...
Maybe he was just too stupid to be allowed to live.
All of humanity is too stupid to live.
Fuck them all.
My boy.
I say, you can't do anything really good... ..until you truly don't care at all if you live or die.
Kill me right now.
I couldn't care less.
It's only when every human misery is just a big joke... ..that you can finally get some enjoyment out of this life.
I wish someone would kill me right now.
- Do you want me to kill you?
- Go for it.
Well, I guess I'd better be going, before I throw up on your rug again.
Wait.
I wanna give you something.
- What's this?
- A gift, from me to you.
- No, I couldn't.
- You could.
You could.
Let's see some ID.
ID.
Are you drunk?
No.
Well, look who's here.
One of those.
Where the hell you been all week?
Been having a really hard time.
Yeah?
Well, you should just do what I always do.
Drop out, and start over again next semester.
This is my third time, soon to be my fourth.
You don't understand.
I'll never have another chance like this.
I can't just... ..start over.
I'll never find another Audrey.
Don't start with this shit again.
Every artist needs a subject, and she's my perfect subject.
- I can't let her slip through my fingers.
- Hey, come on.
Let's rescue these art chicks.
That's easy pickings.
If I can just come up with something for that final survey... ..she'll forget all about Jonah.
- We're gonna miss our chance here.
- I just need to think of something.
There they go.
What can I do?
You know, I think I just figured out who you are.
- Who?
- You're the class douche bag.
Thanks for the beer.
Oh, please.
You can't fall for every guy who does a halfway-decent painting.
I don't know.
There's something about him.
You don't need any more boyfriends, you need about 15 years of therapy.
I thought you were all mad for what's-his-name...
Jonah.
Look... ..when this one doesn't work out...
..you can always come crawling back to me.
So, looks like you finally got Jonah on the run.
- What do you mean?
- He was asking about... ..some painting of yours.
You got a surprise for the final survey?
What do you want?
I need a big favor.
- I see you've come empty-handed.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
You must think I'm the cheapest whore in town.
I'll bring you a case of Slivovitz.
Whatever you want.
I just
- I wanna buy the rest of your paintings.
- They're not for sale.
- Please, just tell me what you want.
- I don't want anything.
- I'm just fucking lost-
- I thought you were an artist.
- I am.
I am.
You wanna be an artist or an "aficionado"?
An artist.
What do you think an artist cares about?
Does he think all day about fine wines... ..and black-tie affairs... ..and what he's gonna say at the next after-dinner speech?
No.
He lives only for that narcotic moment of creative bliss.
A moment... ..that may come once a decade.
Or never at all.
You think I'm wrong?
Fuck you.
You know nothing at all about anything.
- Listen, I don't care about fine wines.
- Oh, I know what you want.
If it was me, I'd get my way by any means possible.
I'd grab them by the balls, and I'd never stop twisting.
Once you're on top, they're helpless.
You've got them squirming under the toe of your shoe.
Would you please put out that goddamn cigarette... ..before you kill me with your awful smoke!
What about the paintings?
I don't care, do whatever you want.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.
I have a confession to make.
Yeah?
Forget it.
- No, what?
- Nothing.
Forget I said anything.
- What is it?
Some boyfriend problem?
- What?
Why?
- I don't know.
What is it?
- Why did you say that?
Do you think I'm gay?
- I don't know.
- Really?
Yeah.
Maybe a little, I guess.
Yeah.
Well, that's it.
That's my confession.
I think I'm gay.
Okay.
Okay.
I thought you said you were working.
I am working.
I gotta have this done for Monday.
It looks fine, Jonah.
It doesn't have to be perfect.
It's got a long way to go.
What's gotten into you?
When you were working Narcotics... ..you didn't spend your off-hours smoking crack.
And what about your son?
He misses his daddy.
Will you get off my ass for once?
Lonny and the guys are here, or are you too busy for them?
Well, look who's here.
How's the Mona Lisa coming, Rembrandt?
You're off duty, Jonah.
You don't gotta dress like a fruitcake.
Yeah.
It's good to see you guys too.
How much longer is this gonna go on, Lonny?
I never see him anymore since he became an artist.
I'm just trying to do my job.
That's a good question, Marie.
So, what about it, superstar?
Hey, we got the blow-ups of the pictures you took.
He used the same colors we found on the glove of the first crime scene.
I don't know about this guy Platz.
He didn't live near the campus when the first killings took place.
He used to come to the city all the time.
He told me so himself.
It would've helped if you had taken a paint sample.
You can't just monkey around with a piece of art like that-
"Piece of shit" is more like it.
You take a look at this fucking thing?
Excuse me, Marie.
We can't even question this asshole?
It's like he's making fun of us.
I'm taking shit to this day about that first weirdo you dragged in.
I can't afford any more fuck-ups.
I need better shit than this, Jonah.
Listen to me, Gerry.
Will you listen to me?
Look...
I know you're a genius, but I'm a genius too.
What are you, on vacation?
Move your ass.
Look, this dyke is gonna make us both a fortune, I'm telling you.
I'm 100 percent on this one.
Fine.
Don't listen to me.
What do I care?
Don't you ever call me again, you ungrateful prick.
Excuse me?
I'm in your TuesdaylThursday class.
Can I ask you a question?
So, there's this... ..freshman survey tomorrow.
And you wanna know what you can do... ..to land a big gallery contract like Marvin Bushmiller.
No.
Not exactly.
Perhaps you want a major retrospective at the Metropolitan?
Actually, there's someone who...
I don't know.
I want her to...
It's for a girl?
Yeah.
You wanna take the prize so you can win the heart of a girl?
Yeah.
That's so exciting.
Think you could look at my paintings and tell me if they're good enough?
No.
But I'll be rooting for you.
Hey.
Think Jonah's getting any gash on the side?
No.
Marie's got him so pussy-whipped it's not even funny.
Hey, hey.
That's our guy.
That's our guy, right there.
Will you look at him.
I ought to wring his neck right now.
- What the fuck are we waiting for?
- He couldn't strangle a cat.
Fucking scumbag!
Where the fuck is Jonah?
Lonny told him to be on the guy's ass.
Jesus, that was disappointing.
Who are you trying to fool with that badass stuff?
All that murder shit?
Totally September 1 Oth, Jerome.
Jerome...
Have you seen Jonah?
No.
Don't despair, okay?
You call me over the break, and we'll get you right back on track.
Okay?
Okay, you win.
It's all yours, so live it up.
- Jerome-
- You're the one out of 100... ..that goes on to fame and fortune.
I'm just another deluded asshole.
- These paintings-
- Fuck those paintings, and fuck you.
You have everybody fooled, but not me.
You came up with a good gimmick, your tough-guy, Joe Normal act... ..but your paintings are fucking bullshit, and you know it.
Well I still kicked your ass, didn't I?
Jonah, come on.
Where you been?
We gotta go.
Jerome, wait here.
I wanna talk to you.
You have to meet your public.
Marvelous work, Jonah.
Good job, Jonah.
Building burned up.
Everybody died.
Some asshole didn't put out his cigarette.
This is it.
What the fuck, Jonah.
Mikey, get your ass over here.
Where's Jonah?
So?
What?
This fucking nobody is gonna stand me up?
I gave him the message, Mr. D'Annunzio.
Hey, come on.
Bob hates people being late.
I really gotta find Jerome.
Come on.
Don't shoot me, man!
Don't shoot!
Police!
Get down on the ground!
Face down!
Cut!
What are you doing, asshole, you ruined my best take!
My arm...
I think my arm is broken.
Well, that's great!
What in fuck's name do I do now?
Hey!
Where have you been?
What the hell is this?
What is this nonsense?
Let's go, hotshot.
Chief wants you right now, come on.
What are you thinking, huh?
You paying attention to me?
God, I'm a fucking idiot.
Did you see a portrait of me?
A really beautiful-
It was right here.
I chucked everything out back.
Police!
Open the door!
I got a warrant!
Police!
Don't try anything!
- Oh, Jesus.
- This isn't what you think.
- Jerome Platz!
- Jerome Platz!
Jerome Platz!
You in there?
- Jerome Platz!
- Hey, Jerome Platz!
Audrey, I know you don't care about me... ..but maybe someday you'll-
Excuse me.
Police business.
Clear the way, please.
Excuse me.
Are we gonna have a problem?
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.
Go draw something, will you?
Lonny, I'm sorry.
I know I let personal things get in the way of my job...
- ... but it'll never happen again.
- Superstar, we got him.
- All's well that ends well, okay?
- Hey, Jonah.
You suck!
Have a nice death, pig.
You wanna spit at us again?
I will take you down so fast, you got no idea, you fucking freak.
Mikey, let's clear it up and get out of here.
- Kevin, you wanna ride with him?
- Let me do it, Lonny.
- Yeah, you fucking pig!
- Fucking pig!
Well, I knew there was something weird about you.
What did you really think about my...?
Did you think my paintings were any good at all?
- Yeah, maybe.
- I could have made it as an artist?
No, I don't know about that.
Hey.
So are you really the guy?
Jerome, look over here!
Let me get a picture!
Jerome!
Jerome.
Visiting hours.
Should we judge an artist by what he does in his personal life?
If he's an anti-Semite, like T.S. Eliot or a bully, like Picasso or in this case, a murderer should his art have any less value?
I think not.
Look, if I wanna have a showing of this artist's work nobody has any right to stop me.
I'm fighting for First Amendment rights.
You're with me or you're a fucking Nazi, as far as I'm concerned.
What?
Why can't I say that?
We didn't even know it was a documentary at first, but then you know, it just sort of all came together.
I mean, that's the way I like to work.
Finding my way as I go along.
No, I don't think I'd ever sell it.
Jerome was always so passionate about his art.
It's really unfortunate what happened but, I mean, I always knew he'd be a famous artist someday.
I just wanna do what's best for my client.
Why don't you trust Jerome to know what's best?
And what's best for Jerome is to stay for as long as possible... ..followed by a lengthy trial.
I have more than enough evidence to get him out.
- This case should not even go to trial.
- Where the fuck did they find you?
Jerome needs a lawyer who understands what to do... ..when a situation like this presents itself.
I am very close to the family.
I went to school with Hugh Platz.
That's real nice.
Now, look...
You know how many paintings I can sell for your client... ..while this is going on?
Jerome.
How's my boy?
- How's the work coming?
- It's fine.
Can't believe how many people are calling about you.
- I had to cut off the waiting list.
- Great.
Jerome, I just wanna let you know... ..if you change your mind, we can get you out of here.
I know, I know.
But we've been through all this.
Are these my only visitors?
Jerome, you get a chance to call the guy from Artforum?
He wants to talk.
Also, did you take a moment to look at those papers?
I need you to sign the yellow one.
Keep your chin up, Jerome.
We all love you.
- All right.
- I'll call you tonight.
Hi.
Hey.
- Can we go now?
- Cut.
I am a genius.
I am the greatest artist of the 20th century.
My name is Pablo Picasso.
I pretty much invented modern art.
And I do weird, abstract paintings even though I can paint totally realistic, if I wanted to.
Also, even though I'm super short and bald I am able to have sex with any beautiful woman I want just because I'm so great.
Come here.
Look.
- Pretty good.
- Thanks.
Some day, if you get famous, this can be worth a lot of money.
You're wasting your time, Jerome.
You gotta set your sights on a more realistic girl.
Shit, here comes Stoob.
Hey, pencil-prick, thanks for helping me with that poster for Erikson's class.
- He said I was a natural artist.
- A natural scam artist.
Got that right, queer-bait.
What's this?
- Are you jacking off in school now?
- It's a college brochure, you moron.
What college has a naked chick for a teacher?
She's an art model, you stupid ape.
Hey.
You're all right, Platz.
I don't know, Jerome.
It just seems a little too good to be true.
Don't you think?
Fucking shit!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's based on the whole thing with the campus murder, but...
Hell no, it ain't no boring-ass documentary.
Look, forget that shit, okay?
Yeah, fucking A, there's gonna be tons of action, are you kidding me?
- You're an art major?
- Yeah.
Drawing and painting.
- What are you guys?
- I'm fashion.
He's film, I guess.
Are you for real?
You're shitting me, right?
- Well, yeah.
- God, this is so depressing.
- Why, what's wrong?
- I just really, really miss my girlfriend.
One hundred percent.
Yeah, you won't be sorry.
I love you too, Grandpa.
Yes!
Yes!
I'm so fucking pumped!
- I'm Vince.
- Hi.
Jerome.
How are you?
- What's your name again?
- Matthew.
God, I'm so fucking jazzed.
I get to make my movie.
That's fantastic.
- You guys freshmen?
- Yeah.
- You a sophomore?
- Junior.
It's all right.
You listen to me, you'll be okay.
Why do you still live in the dorm?
A lot of juniors still live in the dorm.
What's wrong with that?
That guy's some hot shit sculpture major.
I have never seen so many beautiful girls.
This is nothing.
Dude, you should've seen last year's crop.
Enrollment's way off since the murders.
- What murders?
- You're shitting me, right?
I heard about it.
Somebody killed a guy on campus, or whatever.
Yeah.
Three people in the neighborhood since March.
You're fucking with me.
You've never heard about the Strathmore Strangler?
He killed a guy, like, 10 days ago.
- Are you from out of state?
- The suburbs.
Then you have no excuse.
What about Richard Natwick?
- Jesus.
- Sorry, I don't really follow the news.
Okay, I'm gonna give you the story...
You gotta pay attention.
Because this story is huge.
This is, like, national news, man.
I'm listening.
Just after the first murder, there's this guy, Richard Natwick.
He's, like, some second-year painting major.
Does these stupid-ass word paintings.
He has a show at the student center.
Cops send some guys to check it out.
But they're not used to this kind of artsy bullshit, right?
- Fucking...
- Cut your shit.
Get used to being bent over, prick.
So then a couple of professors freak out.
And before you know it, he's like a fucking martyr.
Art is not a crime!
Art is not a crime!
Of course, it turns out he's completely innocent.
And the cops have to totally eat shit.
- So, what happened to him?
- He had his 15 minutes of fame.
Then he got hurt real bad in some crazy-ass performance art thing.
Okay hit the juice.
Anyway, you gotta read my script.
I mean, it's all in there.
It's totally huge.
So, what, you don't get the paper in the suburbs?
I mean, for all they know, the killer could be from the suburbs.
Those cops, they don't know shit.
So, what, you're a drawing major?
Yeah.
Drawing and painting.
That's awesome.
I hear you guys get to see tons of naked vagina.
Okay, Leslie.
Time to work your magic.
First pose, people.
We're gonna hit the ground running.
Okay, first pose.
I don't have any particular wisdom to impart to you people, except this:
These four words:
Don't have unrealistic expectations.
If you wanna make money, better drop out right now.
Go to banking school or website school.
Anywhere but art school.
And remember, only one out of 100 of you will ever make a living as an artist.
Hello?
Yes.
Ah, Lorenzo.
No.
Absolutely, yes...
Sandy, can I get a break up here?
Take a break.
Five minutes.
Are you kidding?
I would absolutely love to have you look at it.
No, because I feel like I've really turned a corner with this latest series.
In January?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sure I could.
I mean, I don't think my plate is completely full.
Well, I'd be happy...
No, of course not.
Hi.
- Really pretty, what you're doing.
- I gotta go.
Jesus.
Why are the people in these freshman classes exactly the same every year?
Look.
You got the vegan holy man.
The boring blowhard.
- The angry lesbian.
- Professor?
Professor?
Professor?
And here, you got kiss-ass.
I wanted to tell you that I looked up some of your paintings on the Internet.
- I thought they were really terrific.
- You get an "A" for the class.
And Mom.
I feel that I am finally about to ripen.
Artistically.
Mom's youngest just left the nest so she's ready to explore her creative side.
How do you know all this stuff?
Because I'm a living cliché just like the rest of these guys.
I'm the guy who keeps dropping out and changing majors because he's afraid he really sucks at everything.
So who am I?
I don't know.
I haven't figured you out yet.
Jesus.
Who's the weirdo?
Professor?
Professor?
Professor Okamura?
What is your attendance policy for this class?
I don't care if you come to class or not.
This is ready for the kiln.
Let me see if I got this right:
You're the guy that never got laid in high school.
So you came here to try to bone your way through an endless lineup of art skanks.
Not exactly.
I mean, I really do wanna be an artist.
A great artist, you know, if possible.
Which enables you to bone your way through a lineup of art skanks.
So why wait, man?
Art school's like a pussy buffet.
I don't want just any girl.
All right.
There she is.
There is the beautiful beatnik art chick of your dreams.
- Yeah, so?
- So ask her to borrow something.
It's the easiest thing in the world.
Want me to teach you?
Daddy will bring you there.
- Jesus...
- Come on.
Hi...
Do you think I could borrow your pencil?
Why?
- What for?
- Doesn't matter, it was a stupid idea.
Oh, my God.
You have the most beautiful eyes.
You have to let me take a picture of them.
Okay.
How about pizza?
Do you wanna go get pizza?
The only trouble with that is all those beatnik chicks are totally insane.
Look, what you really want is a nice, innocent, suburban girl.
Some freshman chick who hasn't been corrupted yet.
Stay out of that cave, Koala Bear.
There's snakes and bats.
Don't be silly, Pepper.
I'm not afraid of a little snake.
You know, come to think of it, they're all insane.
Just find yourself some nympho slut and get it over with.
Excuse me.
Can you help me get this off?
I want you to know, I definitely don't have AIDS.
I've been tested, like, 40 times, so I know it for a fact.
Keep the fucking kid quiet, you motherfucking asshole!
It's just my old man.
Are you serious?
You've never been laid before?
It just hasn't worked out yet.
I have very high standards.
Man, I gotta take you out whore-busting some night.
We gotta remedy this situation before it gets any worse.
Maybe you have issues that make it difficult to feel comfortable with your own sexuality.
Could be, I guess.
You guys know what whore-busting is, right?
You leave the money on the dresser, fuck the whore and go to sleep.
You wake up, not only is your money still there, but she's left you a tip.
It's the fucking greatest deal ever, man.
Crackheads aren't so good.
Their tip is a little glass pipe and a piece of tinfoil.
You don't want that shit.
Get a nice call girl or something, you know?
You fuck a lot of chicks, Matthew?
Yeah, I figured, man.
Fashion, and all that shit.
Models...
Crack whores, call girls, strippers...
We could bust some strippers together, that'd be fucking awesome.
What is art?
Is this art?
Or this?
Or this?
Who's that?
Ignore that.
That's a mistake.
Hamlet.
War and Peace.
"Beethoven's 9th".
Guernica.
These are works which hold as much emotional resonance today as they did at the time of their creation.
What makes a work of art timeless?
What qualities must it possess?
- Yes?
- Everything on your list was done by a dead white male.
I noticed that too.
To be clear, they were not yet dead when they created those works.
You're just playing into the patriarchy.
The history of art is largely about the implementation of masculinity.
- That is such bullshit.
- Part of some Darwinian imperative.
Most artists become artists because they have no way to attract a mate.
I hardly think I'm the first to point out that the vast preponderance of artists are, shall we say physiologically deficient in some way.
Dribble the ball, Hurst!
Please don't yell.
- Going to Marvin Bushmiller's talk?
- Yeah, are you?
We better get there early.
It's weird how he's so famous.
I used to see him around Strathmore when I was a freshman.
I saw his show at Broadway Bob's now he's on the cover of Artforum.
- Well, that's how it works.
- Platz!
Get in there.
Mr. Bushmiller, The New York Times has called your work:
"An expedition to the far contours of an evolving techno-culture."
With that in mind, where do you see art headed in the 21st century?
"Art" who?
No, really, that's such a stupid question.
Why don't you ask me something relevant.
Ask me how much money I have in the bank, or...
Did you learn anything at Strathmore?
Yes, I learned many things.
I learned that the faculty is made up of old failures who teach only because they need the health insurance.
Present company excluded, of course.
I was about to say.
David was too busy trolling the halls for fresh meat to worry about health.
What advice would you give to a young artist...
Shut up.
There's only one question any of you wanna ask.
You wanna know what it would take to turn you into me.
Well, listen closely, because I'm gonna give you the answer.
In order to be a great artist you simply have to be a great artist.
There's nothing to learn, so you're all wasting your time.
Go home.
Why are you such an asshole?
Now, that's a great question.
No, it really is.
I am an asshole because that is my true nature.
Maybe it's everybody's true nature.
Every one of you looks like a fucking asshole, but who knows?
The difference between you and me is that I have gained the freedom to express my true nature.
And what could be more beautiful than truth and freedom?
Another day, another dollar.
Hello, Larry.
Oh, by the way are you and Lois gonna be free the night of January 18th?
How the hell should I know?
Well, I have to do this little gallery thing.
Lorenzo Massengale has been torturing me to put my new series of paintings in his new space and I just thought maybe you and Lois would want an invitation.
I think I'm busy that night, Sandiford.
Here, I stopped off at Broadway Bob's.
You're welcome.
I thought Broadway Bob's was an art gallery or something.
It's a very famous shithole run by an obnoxious windbag who takes credit for the career of every half-talented monkey who ever took a class at Strathmore.
But the coffee's good.
Hello, Lorenzo, it's Sandy.
Just wanted to make sure you got the slides and...
You don't need to call me, because I have a class starting.
So I will call you afterwards.
Thanks.
Bye.
Sorry I'm late.
Hello, dear.
Looks like this is our lucky day.
I'm sorry, Sandy, I'm just dying for a cigarette.
Yes, absolutely.
Five-minute break.
I'm gonna go to the john.
Let me borrow this.
All right.
She smiled at you, how sweet.
You've seen her before?
Who is she?
Don't get your hopes up.
She's prime real estate, my friend.
Hey, faggots.
What a cute couple.
I think they like us.
- Is she a student or just a model?
- Can we forget about her for a minute?
We're about to have a life-changing experience here.
Jimmy, it's Bardo.
Brought someone over to meet you.
I got a bottle of Slivovitz here.
It's 80 proof, made in Poland, imported by...
Boys, welcome.
I'm afraid you've interrupted me in the middle of one of my shows.
This is Jerome.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thank you for having us.
A pleasure.
Isn't this a great place?
Jimmy's got rent control.
So Jerome here wants to be a great artist, Jimmy.
How terrific.
Jerome, are you exceptionally skilled as a cocksucker?
It wasn't a rhetorical question.
Are you a great artist when it comes to fellatio?
No.
No, I guess not.
Well, that's no good.
So who do you like?
Who's your favorite artist, Jerome?
- Maybe Picasso.
- I see.
Very good.
Our old friend "pick-asshole."
The nasty little dwarf who went his whole life without a single original thought.
I presume you're joking, right?
Jimmy's a Strathmore grad.
Just look at me now.
Just think, Jerome.
One day, this could all be yours.
You're going places, young man.
I can feel it.
But you need to take some lessons in sucking cock and licking ass.
Otherwise, you might find yourself rotting away in some shithole postponing suicide for the slim chance that you might one day possibly see some glorious plague or pestilence bring horrible suffering to your hateful species.
What are you smiling about?
Laugh away, laughing boy!
I will stomp your guts till they shoot out your ass!
I will bury you alive and shit on your grave!
Okay, boys.
Show's over.
I have to get back to my masturbation.
Isn't Jimmy great?
Yeah, definitely.
Self-portrait.
Starting next week I will be selecting the most effective work from each session and placing it in the hall gallery.
- Which gallery?
- It's on this floor.
- Down at the end of the hall.
- By the men's toilet?
Yes.
Now, let's get started on these.
Who wants to comment?
I like Flower's drawing.
- Yeah.
Me too.
- It seems like she's trying to do something more than just draw herself.
It's more about the process of drawing.
All right.
Does anything else up here command your attention?
Does anyone have anything more to say on Flower's piece?
Yes, Jerome?
- Nothing.
- Well, "nothing" doesn't exist in this classroom.
What are you thinking?
We're waiting, Jerome.
I don't know.
It just...
It looks like a lame Cy Twombly imitation to me.
It looks like she did it in about two minutes.
That is such bullshit.
Because her drawing isn't perfect, it's automatically bad?
At least it has humanity.
Yeah, totally.
Jerome, your drawing looks like it was done by a machine.
Whereas Flower's...
Flower's is full of playfulness and...
Yeah, like, humanity.
What's so great about humanity?
Humans are a bunch of jerks.
I hope a plague wipes out the species.
- What is your problem?
- Jesus Christ, Jerome.
Okay, that's enough.
This is a required assignment.
I have to give it to you.
And, Flower, it is certainly not worth crying about, okay?
Hey, man.
I agree with you 100 percent.
I think the entire human race should be wiped off the face of the earth.
Oh, I didn't really mean...
I was just...
You don't have to apologize.
I'm totally with you on this.
So this is the hall gallery.
Hey.
You guys have to come to my opening tonight.
You were really an asshole in class today.
Hey.
You guys.
So are we gonna go see Shilo's opening?
- How did she ever get a gallery show?
- It's totally meaningless.
Any idiot could sign up for a student gallery.
Oh, my God.
What?
I didn't notice that.
We gotta go.
Great work, Shilo.
Hey.
Do you know this girl?
Yeah.
We had her as a model.
Remember?
But do you know who she is?
Do you know her name?
You are such a prick.
What?
You can't say anything nice about my photos?
- Hi.
- Hi.
That came out really good.
- Thank you.
- Shilo.
What?
Oh, hi.
I'm Audrey, by the way.
So is that your real name?
Or are you just obsessed with Audrey Hepburn like every art school chick?
I was named after an old cartoon.
Another ironic pop culture reference.
She's a keeper.
- Hey.
- God, do you know that guy?
- No.
I thought he was your friend.
- No way.
Oh, you're the guy from Sandy's class.
I have such a bad memory for faces.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I'm Jerome.
I was thinking about you today.
I saw an old photo of Marie-Thérèse Walter and it looked just like the way that you drew me.
She's one of the women who modeled for Picasso.
I know just the picture you're talking about.
You do?
Let's get out of here.
What?
I said I liked your photos.
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's okay.
I couldn't bear to watch you get cornered by that creep again.
Well, I have to get going anyway.
I'm kind of making the rounds tonight.
Really?
Well, maybe sometime we could...
I have to go to a Donald Baumgarten show.
Oh, I know who he is.
He's an old pop art guy, right?
Yeah, he's really good.
He's great.
He's absolutely awful.
But I can't get out of it.
Do you wanna go with me?
Come on, please.
I hate to take the subway by myself.
Especially with that weirdo out there strangling everybody.
A little bit.
Well, my parents go a lot.
Hi.
Audrey, I was afraid you weren't coming.
So how's it going?
Well, I think I might have sold two of the small ones.
- The ones you hate.
- I like them just fine.
You know that.
Just not as much as the big, blue ones.
I know.
Daddy, this is Jerome.
Jerome is a big fan of yours.
I brought him to meet you.
Jerome, this is Donald Baumgarten.
Wow.
I'm a big fan of yours, sir.
It's really a pleasure.
My pleasure, son.
Daddy, I hate to do this, but I don't think we can stay.
Jerome has to meet someone at another party, and we're late, so...
- Will I see you on Sunday?
- I'll call you.
I can't believe you grew up with a dad like that.
He's a famous artist.
He's hardly a famous artist.
It's really heartbreaking.
He should've given up, like, 30 years ago.
God, I am starving.
- Should we go eat somewhere?
- Sure.
Have you ever heard of Broadway Bob's?
So why are you a model?
Just for the money?
Oh, yeah.
I make a fortune.
My God, is that who I think it is?
He's always here.
That table is practically reserved for post-minimalists.
This is where everybody gets their first big show.
It's like the launching pad from Strathmore to the real world.
- How do they pick who gets a show?
- They go to the surveys and all that.
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?
When's the last time you came to see me?
Jerome, this is Broadway Bob.
- How you doing?
- Hi.
Bob knows everybody.
Every artist you can think of had their first show in this place.
Bushmiller, Naugle, Bilbo, you name it.
The minute they get famous, they got no time for me, right?
Hey!
I told you to stop hassling my customers!
Hector!
Fucking Brown Shirts.
What are you doing?
- Good to see you.
- Bye.
- Tell your father I said hi.
- Okay.
- Hey.
Excuse me.
- Yeah, what?
You wanna help me out?
I got two homeless fucks outside that panhandle all day.
They bother my customers outside.
This kid's not a serial killer.
Look at that guy out there.
- Just get the fuck out.
- All right, let's go.
- Your coffee sucks.
- Go to Starbucks.
Who's this?
- Jerome, this is Candace.
- Hi, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
Audrey and I used to bump cunts.
Just kidding.
But little Audrey doesn't wanna play with me anymore, does she.
What do you think of these paintings?
They're okay.
I mean, they're not the most...
They're Candace's paintings.
- They're really good.
- Where do you find them, Audrey?
Anyway, thanks to this little exhibit, I'll get a spring show at the Haberman.
- That's really great.
Congratulations.
- I know.
Golly gosh!
- You.
Get over here.
- Later, kids.
What's this I hear about a show at Haberman?
You gotta let me know...
So, what do you wanna do, Jerome?
I wanna be the greatest artist of the 21st century.
Oh, I just meant, "What do you wanna do now?"
I should probably get home.
- I'm stupid...
- No, no, I think it's great.
I think you really could be a great artist.
You have the right kind of energy.
- You won't believe...
- Did you hear the news?
- No, but guess where I was?
- The strangler got another one.
Some poor schmuck on his way to the subway.
I got a major rewrite to do.
- I was on the subway tonight.
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Anyway, guess what I was doing.
- Smoking pole?
No, I was on a date with the most beautiful girl in the whole school.
All right.
Can I smell your finger?
Look.
No shit.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
She thinks I'm a great artist.
You fucking snake.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Did you already pop her?
No, I...
- You know, we just met...
- Man, if she was my girlfriend I would be pounding that shit day and night.
November 28th.
November 28th.
Try and keep that date in your tiny, little, drug-addled brains.
That is the date of the post-Thanksgiving assessment where you'll put up all your work and a bunch of us professors are gonna sneak in behind your backs and give you a grade.
However, that is but a mere prelude to this day:
December 19th.
December 19th is the final survey where you will receive your one-and-only official grade for this class provided, of course, you all haven't been murdered by then.
I heard the final survey is where big-shot gallery owners show up to troll for new talent.
I wouldn't worry about that too much right now.
This could be a big break for somebody.
But this is not Schwab's drugstore.
You are definitely not Lana Turner.
- What does that mean?
- It means you children are too young to be worrying about that.
Now, Eno, why haven't you been doing the assignments?
Frankly, I find them constricting and largely irrelevant.
My work has nothing to do with form or light or color but with questioning the nature of aesthetic experience.
I'll buy that.
- Jonah, what about you?
- I'll bring something next time.
Sorry.
I also heard that the student with the best grade gets a show at Broadway Bob's.
- That's been known to happen, yes.
Professor Okamura said no one in your class ever got the best grade.
Well, Larry seems to care about that kind of thing a lot more than I do.
And Larry has a tendency to live vicariously through his students which I find rather pathetic.
I also heard they're cutting faculty, and all the profs are shitting bricks trying to get a student to the Broadway Bob show.
Actually.
I'm too busy concentrating on my own painting to get involved with any kind of faculty intrigue.
Is it true Marvin Bushmiller got his break when he got the best grade?
Audrey.
Hi.
I just came in to get a coffee.
I have to model for Professor Bogle's class at 6:30.
Can I walk with you?
God, you're so polite.
Sure.
Look at you.
So content with your happy, little lives.
But none of you know the taste of true happiness the happiness that only death can bring.
I am hell on earth, personified!
What do you think?
Should I trim that last part?
How much longer you gonna be?
It's up to the boss.
See you later.
Hey, hey, hey.
You can't just leave.
What do you think of the movie so far?
- It's fine.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
She doesn't get this kind of stuff.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I gotta cram some love story into this thing, man.
Those skags make up 50 percent of the audience.
You're missing the best part.
Hey.
Now we're not gonna have any more official assignments in this class.
Last week, I asked you to bring in what you thought was your best work of art, old or new.
Okay?
And we're gonna use that work as a starting point to, hopefully, help you become better artists.
"We live in a police state."
Ain't that the truth.
This is interesting.
That's not finished, but I thought the class might find it interesting to see the various stages of my process.
Indeed.
And what have we here?
- Who did this?
- That's mine.
Where have you been all my life?
- What do we think of this work, class?
- It's so...
It's like, he figured out how to unlearn all the typical art school bullshit.
It's really great.
It has the singularity of outsider art, though the conscious rejection of spatial dynamics could only come from an intimacy with the conventions of picture-making.
Are you kidding me?
You look at?
Professor Okamura, what are some of your favorite Halloween memories?
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
You want a drink?
There's some weird orange punch over there.
- Yeah.
That's really sweet.
Thank you.
- Okay.
Better get back there.
You're about to get cock-blocked by Joe College.
How did you do that painting?
It's like you've never seen another painting before.
What the fuck?
My God, we look like Bonnie and Clyde.
Oh, thanks.
Isn't it weird?
Look how perfectly we match.
- That's great.
- There's an empty seat over there.
Looks like a duel.
No?
Comments?
Jonah's seems totally original and authentic.
And Jerome's just seems lame.
It's pathetic.
No offense.
Yeah, it's like Jonah is tapping into this total childhood innocence.
He's got a whole way of seeing that's completely outside the box.
And Jerome is totally in the box, you know?
- Yeah.
It sucks.
- You know, Jerome's is really...
Okay, I think that's fine.
We shouldn't be too hard on Jerome.
Jerome's trying to do something that is essentially impossible.
He's trying to sing in his own voice using someone else's vocal chords.
I mean, it's the greatest.
He picks a completely random victim.
I mean, this chick was, like...
She was, like, a cashier or something.
- How do they know it's the same guy?
- Come on, it's obvious.
There's a million clues.
For one thing, he always...
- Okay, I believe you.
- Look at her.
She was only 31 years old.
I mean, it's like a goddamn miracle.
Here I am, busting my nuts trying to find some female character for my movie and this guy goes and drops one right in my lap.
Murder?
Don't worry so much, man.
No one's gonna murder me.
I don't want nothing to happen to my best ho.
The streets ain't safe no more.
Not since...
Fuck you.
You're just trying to keep me down, and I am not your whore any more.
I mean...
I'm not your whore no more.
This is total shit, you know that?
No, I don't know that.
Come on.
All of this "gangsta," "motherfucker" bullshit.
Why do you wanna regurgitate this Hollywood crap for the zillionth time?
Don't you have anything original to say?
- I think I do.
- Then you need to say it.
Because this is completely worthless.
- Hello?
- Hi.
It's Jerome Platz.
- Hey, Jerome Platz.
- Hey, I was just calling...
To...
I've got...
I've gotta go home for Thanksgiving, and I was wondering if you had any plans, if, maybe, you wanted to come with me...
Unfortunately, I have to go up north to visit my grandmother.
- But that's really nice of you.
- No...
Don't be silly.
Have a great time.
I'll talk to you soon.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Take care.
Bye.
I think maybe I'll go on tour with Dominick's band this summer.
They're playing shows in the Midwest.
They need someone to sell T-shirts.
Who's Dominick?
This guy, who's friends with Stacy's big brother.
- Forget about it.
- God, you are so unfair.
Jerome gets to go to art school, and I can't go on a summer trip.
You gonna get a job doing paintings somewhere once school's done?
That's not really how it works.
Who in their right mind would buy your paintings?
- Cynthia.
- God, you love Jerome more than me.
You know what you gotta do?
Figure out who's the top guy in your business and hook up with him.
It's not what you do so much as who you know.
That's how it is in my business, and it's all about business.
Yeah.
Actually, I've kind of made a connection already.
My girlfriend's dad is kind of a famous artist, so...
- Your what?
- Hugh help me get the rest of the pies out of the oven?
We thought for sure you were a homo.
My friend's granddaughter paints little pictures on the shoes...
Oh, what do you call them?
Anyhow, she paints pictures of little animals and whatnot.
And I believe the other children pay her for it.
"Sneakers."
Isn't that what they call them?
Anyhow, that's something I thought you could do, Jeremy.
It's not that at all.
It's just that, I really felt that they were some of, really, the best things I'd done in a very long time.
And I'm just...
And I'm just slightly surprised that...
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
I'm Helena Sandiford.
Sandy will be right with you.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate...
No, I do.
I do understand.
No.
Not at all.
And I really appreciate you looking at the slides.
Yeah.
And you.
Bye.
Go fuck yourself, Lorenzo!
Those are mine, yes.
They're really good.
Yes, I rather like them.
Unfortunately, we're not in the majority, Jerome.
Apparently, they're a little too "difficult" for some people.
So how long have you been doing the triangles?
A long time.
I was one of the first.
So tell me, Jerome what are you not getting out of my class?
I don't know.
I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing and...
Maybe I should be finding my own style or voice or something.
That is absolute bullshit.
What would an artist at your age want with a style?
What about Jonah?
He's got sort of a style.
No, Jonah doesn't have a style.
He has a sort of "nowness."
It's exciting.
It's seductive.
But that does not mean, Jerome that he is a better artist than you are.
Far from it.
You're very similar to me.
It is going to take you a very long time to get where you're going.
Look, do you have any idea how long it took me to paint like this?
- No.
- Twenty-five years.
Jerome, it is absolutely essential at your age that you start to experiment with all the arts all the philosophies and all the lifestyles.
So, that's what you think I should do, is try a bunch of different styles and see where it takes me?
Yes, yes and yes, Jerome.
- Okay.
- I have seen so many young artists get locked into this incredibly rigid way of thinking.
So that's what I should try to do, is experiment?
Absolutely.
And I am here to facilitate that experimentation in any way I can either in or out of the classroom.
Thank you, professor.
For the last time, come on, get out.
Get out of my building.
He says they're all done.
We can go in now.
Too experimental.
You're all over the map.
No focus.
Hollow and derivative.
You need to be yourself.
What's up, Platz?
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are you going to Marvin Bushmiller's opening?
No.
I didn't even know about it.
It might be an invite-only thing.
It's probably done through his gallery.
- I'm sure it'll be a total drag, anyway.
- When is it?
I don't even know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I can't believe it.
I got an "A."
Everybody got an "A".
It's a total scam to trick everybody into feeling good about themselves.
Yeah, well, I never got better than a "C" in my whole life.
That's hard to believe.
Yeah, well, guess I didn't go to class too much.
- I was too busy getting into trouble.
- Really.
Yeah, me too.
No kidding.
Did you grow up in the city?
Well, not right in the city.
But I came here all the time.
All the fucking time.
Practically lived here.
So how about it, dude?
You got any deep, dark secrets we should know about?
Forgive me!
What the hell was that?
Don't worry, it's a totally rough cut.
That's a temp score without...
I thought you were gonna make a nice little murder picture but, here, you got the worms and the dancing...
- Did you like it?
- It's symbolism, Grandpa.
And where are the guns?
I thought this was a shoot-them-up.
The guy's a strangler, Grandpa.
What am I supposed to do?
I want guns.
The movie is called, The Strathmore Strangler.
You want the strangler to shoot people?
I paid for a movie with guns.
Hello, Torsiello Gallery.
I can put you on the pre-waiting list.
It's not working.
Do it better.
Excuse me.
We're closed.
I heard that Mr. Bushmiller was having a party tonight.
And I was just wondering if there was...
Sorry.
Invite only.
I was gonna make up some elaborate lie, but I decided to be honest.
I'm desperate.
I'm not crazy.
I won't even talk to Mr. Bushmiller.
You see how busy I am here?
Please.
Please.
Did you put any grenadine in this?
I'm new to this.
I'm sorry.
I'd like a Martell.
There you go.
I heard that Marvin needed some help, so I figured, why not?
I'll have a...
I'm just gonna take one of these.
Just a Bud is fine.
We have...
Hoegaarden or Stella Artois.
The first one.
You look pretty busy, so...
I drink Slivovitz, not Sambuca.
You were right about art.
It's all about the cock-sucking.
It's not what you do, but who you blow.
And even that's not enough.
You don't even have a chance, unless you're the most ruthless cold-blooded...
Jesus, I'm really sorry.
Have you heard about the great man's latest masterpiece?
- No.
- Some of his finest work, I believe.
Damn good stuff.
Who?
The murderer?
"The murderer"?
That's so disrespectful.
Got a few victims for him, if he's interested.
Do you wanna see my paintings?
This is my humble tribute to the great man.
He doesn't simply reproduce reality, like an ordinary idiot artist.
He courageously reshapes it to suit his own needs.
And why did our great artist select these particular victims?
Who can say?
A real artist knows when he's found his ideal subject.
Perhaps, this one was a dishonest cashier.
This one might have reminded him of a domineering aunt.
And this one...
Maybe he was just too stupid to be allowed to live.
All of humanity is too stupid to live.
Fuck them all.
My boy.
I say, you can't do anything really good until you truly don't care at all if you live or die.
Kill me right now.
I couldn't care less.
It's only when every human misery is just a big joke that you can finally get some enjoyment out of this life.
I wish someone would kill me right now.
- Do you want me to kill you?
- Go for it.
Well, I guess I'd better be going, before I throw up on your rug again.
Wait.
I wanna give you something.
- What's this?
- A gift, from me to you.
- No, I couldn't.
- You could.
You could.
Let's see some ID.
ID.
Are you drunk?
No.
Well, look who's here.
One of those.
Where the hell you been all week?
Been having a really hard time.
Yeah?
Well, you should just do what I always do.
Drop out, and start over again next semester.
This is my third time, soon to be my fourth.
You don't understand.
I'll never have another chance like this.
I can't just start over.
I'll never find another Audrey.
Don't start with this shit again.
Every artist needs a subject, and she's my perfect subject.
- I can't let her slip through my fingers.
- Hey, come on.
Let's rescue these art chicks.
That's easy pickings.
If I can just come up with something for that final survey she'll forget all about Jonah.
- We're gonna miss our chance here.
- I just need to think of something.
There they go.
What can I do?
You know, I think I just figured out who you are.
- Who?
- You're the class douche bag.
Thanks for the beer.
Oh, please.
You can't fall for every guy who does a halfway-decent painting.
I don't know.
There's something about him.
You don't need any more boyfriends, you need about 15 years of therapy.
I thought you were all mad for what's-his-name...
Jonah.
Look when this one doesn't work out you can always come crawling back to me.
So, looks like you finally got Jonah on the run.
- What do you mean?
- He was asking about some painting of yours.
You got a surprise for the final survey?
What do you want?
I need a big favor.
- I see you've come empty-handed.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
You must think I'm the cheapest whore in town.
I'll bring you a case of Slivovitz.
Whatever you want.
I just...
I wanna buy the rest of your paintings.
- They're not for sale.
- Please, just tell me what you want.
- I don't want anything.
- I'm just fucking lost...
- I thought you were an artist.
- I am.
I am.
You wanna be an artist or an "aficionado"?
An artist.
What do you think an artist cares about?
Does he think all day about fine wines and black-tie affairs and what he's gonna say at the next after-dinner speech?
No.
He lives only for that narcotic moment of creative bliss.
A moment that may come once a decade.
Or never at all.
You think I'm wrong?
Fuck you.
You know nothing at all about anything.
- Listen, I don't care about fine wines.
- Oh, I know what you want.
If it was me, I'd get my way by any means possible.
I'd grab them by the balls, and I'd never stop twisting.
Once you're on top, they're helpless.
You've got them squirming under the toe of your shoe.
Would you please put out that goddamn cigarette before you kill me with your awful smoke!
What about the paintings?
I don't care, do whatever you want.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.
I have a confession to make.
Yeah?
Forget it.
- No, what?
- Nothing.
Forget I said anything.
- What is it?
Some boyfriend problem?
- What?
Why?
- I don't know.
What is it?
- Why did you say that?
Do you think I'm gay?
- I don't know.
- Really?
Yeah.
Maybe a little, I guess.
Yeah.
Well, that's it.
That's my confession.
I think I'm gay.
Okay.
Okay.
I thought you said you were working.
I am working.
I gotta have this done for Monday.
It looks fine, Jonah.
It doesn't have to be perfect.
It's got a long way to go.
What's gotten into you?
When you were working Narcotics you didn't spend your off-hours smoking crack.
And what about your son?
He misses his daddy.
Will you get off my ass for once?
Lonny and the guys are here, or are you too busy for them?
Well, look who's here.
How's the Mona Lisa coming, Rembrandt?
You're off duty, Jonah.
You don't gotta dress like a fruitcake.
Yeah.
It's good to see you guys too.
How much longer is this gonna go on, Lonny?
I never see him anymore since he became an artist.
I'm just trying to do my job.
That's a good question, Marie.
So, what about it, superstar?
Hey, we got the blow-ups of the pictures you took.
He used the same colors we found on the glove of the first crime scene.
I don't know about this guy Platz.
He didn't live near the campus when the first killings took place.
He used to come to the city all the time.
He told me so himself.
It would've helped if you had taken a paint sample.
You can't just monkey around with a piece of art like that...
"Piece of shit" is more like it.
You take a look at this fucking thing?
Excuse me, Marie.
We can't even question this asshole?
It's like he's making fun of us.
I'm taking shit to this day about that first weirdo you dragged in.
I can't afford any more fuck-ups.
I need better shit than this, Jonah.
Listen to me, Gerry.
Will you listen to me?
Look...
I know you're a genius, but I'm a genius too.
What are you, on vacation?
Move your ass.
Look, this dyke is gonna make us both a fortune, I'm telling you.
I'm 100 percent on this one.
Fine.
Don't listen to me.
What do I care?
Don't you ever call me again, you ungrateful prick.
Excuse me?
I'm in your Tuesday/Thursday class.
Can I ask you a question?
So, there's this freshman survey tomorrow.
And you wanna know what you can do to land a big gallery contract like Marvin Bushmiller.
No.
Not exactly.
Perhaps you want a major retrospective at the Metropolitan?
Actually, there's someone who...
I don't know.
I want her to...
It's for a girl?
Yeah.
You wanna take the prize so you can win the heart of a girl?
Yeah.
That's so exciting.
Think you could look at my paintings and tell me if they're good enough?
No.
But I'll be rooting for you.
Hey.
Think Jonah's getting any gash on the side?
No.
Marie's got him so pussy-whipped it's not even funny.
Hey, hey.
That's our guy.
That's our guy, right there.
Will you look at him.
I ought to wring his neck right now.
- What the fuck are we waiting for?
- He couldn't strangle a cat.
Fucking scumbag!
Where the fuck is Jonah?
Lonny told him to be on the guy's ass.
Jesus, that was disappointing.
Who are you trying to fool with that badass stuff?
All that murder shit?
Totally September 10th, Jerome.
Jerome...
Have you seen Jonah?
No.
Don't despair, okay?
You call me over the break, and we'll get you right back on track.
Okay?
Okay, you win.
It's all yours, so live it up.
- Jerome...
- You're the one out of 100 that goes on to fame and fortune.
I'm just another deluded asshole.
- These paintings...
- Fuck those paintings, and fuck you.
You have everybody fooled, but not me.
You came up with a good gimmick, your tough-guy, Joe Normal act but your paintings are fucking bullshit, and you know it.
Well I still kicked your ass, didn't I?
Jonah, come on.
Where you been?
We gotta go.
Jerome, wait here.
I wanna talk to you.
You have to meet your public.
Marvelous work, Jonah.
Good job, Jonah.
Building burned up.
Everybody died.
Some asshole didn't put out his cigarette.
This is it.
What the fuck, Jonah.
Mikey, get your ass over here.
Where's Jonah?
So?
What?
This fucking nobody is gonna stand me up?
I gave him the message, Mr. D'Annunzio.
Hey, come on.
Bob hates people being late.
I really gotta find Jerome.
Come on.
Don't shoot me, man!
Don't shoot!
Police!
Get down on the ground!
Face down!
Cut!
What are you doing, asshole, you ruined my best take!
My arm...
I think my arm is broken.
Well, that's great!
What in fuck's name do I do now?
Hey!
Where have you been?
What the hell is this?
What is this nonsense?
Let's go, hotshot.
Chief wants you right now, come on.
What are you thinking, huh?
You paying attention to me?
God, I'm a fucking idiot.
Did you see a portrait of me?
A really beautiful...
It was right here.
I chucked everything out back.
Police!
Open the door!
I got a warrant!
Police!
Don't try anything!
- Oh, Jesus.
- This isn't what you think.
- Jerome Platz!
- Jerome Platz!
Jerome Platz!
You in there?
- Jerome Platz!
- Hey, Jerome Platz!
Audrey, I know you don't care about me but maybe someday you'll...
Excuse me.
Police business.
Clear the way, please.
Excuse me.
Are we gonna have a problem?
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.
Go draw something, will you?
Lonny, I'm sorry.
I know I let personal things get in the way of my job but it'll never happen again.
- Superstar, we got him.
- All's well that ends well, okay?
- Hey, Jonah.
You suck!
Have a nice death, pig.
You wanna spit at us again?
I will take you down so fast, you got no idea, you fucking freak.
Mikey, let's clear it up and get out of here.
- Kevin, you wanna ride with him?
- Let me do it, Lonny.
- Yeah, you fucking pig!
- Fucking pig!
Well, I knew there was something weird about you.
What did you really think about my?
Did you think my paintings were any good at all?
- Yeah, maybe.
- I could have made it as an artist?
No, I don't know about that.
Hey.
So are you really the guy?
Jerome, look over here!
Let me get a picture!
Jerome!
Jerome.
Visiting hours.
Should we judge an artist by what he does in his personal life?
If he's an anti-Semite, like T.S. Eliot or a bully, like Picasso or in this case, a murderer should his art have any less value?
I think not.
Look, if I wanna have a showing of this artist's work nobody has any right to stop me.
I'm fighting for First Amendment rights.
You're with me or you're a fucking Nazi, as far as I'm concerned.
What?
Why can't I say that?
We didn't even know it was a documentary at first, but then you know, it just sort of all came together.
I mean, that's the way I like to work.
Finding my way as I go along.
No, I don't think I'd ever sell it.
Jerome was always so passionate about his art.
It's really unfortunate what happened but, I mean, I always knew he'd be a famous artist someday.
I just wanna do what's best for my client.
Why don't you trust Jerome to know what's best?
And what's best for Jerome is to stay for as long as possible followed by a lengthy trial.
I have more than enough evidence to get him out.
- This case should not even go to trial.
- Where the fuck did they find you?
Jerome needs a lawyer who understands what to do when a situation like this presents itself.
I am very close to the family.
I went to school with Hugh Platz.
That's real nice.
Now, look...
You know how many paintings I can sell for your client while this is going on?
Jerome.
How's my boy?
- How's the work coming?
- It's fine.
Can't believe how many people are calling about you.
- I had to cut off the waiting list.
- Great.
Jerome, I just wanna let you know if you change your mind, we can get you out of here.
I know, I know.
But we've been through all this.
Are these my only visitors?
Jerome, you get a chance to call the guy from Artforum?
He wants to talk.
Also, did you take a moment to look at those papers?
I need you to sign the yellow one.
Keep your chin up, Jerome.
We all love you.
- All right.
- I'll call you tonight.
Hi.
Hey.
- Can we go now?
- Cut.
You're late.
Was there a problem with the cash?
No, the money wasn't the problem.
I had to ditch my roommate.
You don't know my roommate.
Here, $2000, the rest of my savings.
No worries, Lana, we're just about fixed for your fix.
This is not a drug trip.
Relax, Lance, just a little syringe-speak humor.
I wasn't implying that it's a hallucination.
Damn straight.
This little cocktail is my lock on a Nobel Prize.
And a big fat deal with the pharmaceutical company.
I wanna stay down longer this time.
- Two minutes.
- Forget it.
- It's too dangerous.
- Come on, Lance.
It's only 20 seconds longer than last time, and I almost found them.
What could it hurt?
I've been down almost as long.
You know you can bring her back.
Mom.
Dad.
Oh, my God.
I never thought I'd see you again.
- I've missed you so much.
- Oh, we've missed you too, honey.
I've just been so confused, I didn't know where to turn.
- We know how hard it's been.
- I loved him so much.
- I thought I could handle it.
- We're here for you, Lana.
No!
No!
No...
- I got her.
- Lana, chill, you're good.
Back among the living.
You were gone too long.
We almost didn't get you back.
Wait.
It wasn't long enough.
I have to go back.
Clark?
We've got a problem.
Fast, but oddly formal.
Usually when I say it's "urgent..."
you rip in here without the least regard for my privacy.
- I didn't wanna disturb you.
- Don't worry, Lana's not here.
Actually, she didn't come home at all last night.
It's not another guy.
She's been hanging out with these med students... and they keep really wicked hours.
But you know, Clark, it will happen.
Eventually she will find someone else.
Yeah, she deserves to be happy.
What's our crisis?
Mass destruction and death in Central America.
And the possibility that your former professor, Milton Fine, is involved.
- No, he's dead.
- I know we thought we saw him die.
But the only thing we're really sure "of..."
is that he disappeared, and so did that ship.
- Where'd you get this?
- A source tipped me off.
- Catch you later, Lana.
- Yeah.
I'll call you later.
- Sorry.
- You guys are friends.
It was bound to happen sometime, right?
I didn't think you'd be back.
So should I even bother asking what you were up to last night?
Just hanging out, Chloe, it was no big deal.
Maybe not, but it doesn't really look like all nighters agree with you.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Because you don't look okay.
Lana, I know that Clark's breakup's been really difficult, but...
Chloe, it's not like someone died.
All right?
People break up every day.
It's not a big deal.
I'll get over it.
In short, this minor tax increase... can make a major difference in our public schools.
Senator, how do you feel about Clayton's "allegations..."
that your proposal will drain money from constituents... failing to help schools?
I'd be more than happy to respond to the congressman's "concerns..."
should Congressman Clayton care to ask me in person.
- Thank you very much for coming.
- Well, thank you, senator.
Nice strategy, senator.
When attacked, don't hesitate, come out fighting.
I meant what I said.
A public debate is what I'm hoping for.
I'd hate to have to go through this every time.
You won't.
It'll get easier once you've made it clear you're a player.
I've...
I brought you something.
Something that just might give you a bit of an edge.
We're both going to that dinner tomorrow night... at" the governor's mansion.
A copy of my research.
Everything there is to know about our dinner companions.
Believe it or not, Lionel, I've done my homework.
I know each person's position and what their voting record is.
What I don't know is why you're doing this.
I am not trying to manipulate your vote, Martha.
Look at it.
- Congressman Clayton plays polo?
- His passion.
- His daughter's a gymnast.
- Olympic standard.
Look, it may be a political function, but in my experience... the last thing anyone wants to do over dinner is talk shop.
Just...
It's another way to connect with your colleagues.
Why don't we go together tomorrow night?
I'll help you navigate the rough waters.
Thank you.
But, Lionel, I hope you're not expecting something on a personal level.
The two of us will never be anything more than friends.
I understand.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man?
Can I see that?
Between the two is the labrum, or articular cartilage.
Divide the deltoid and its attachments, then you'll cut through the humerus.
Okay, you need to come through the bone two inches below the joint.
- Lance.
- What are you doing here?
I have to do it again soon.
You keep your voice down.
You could get us expelled.
- Get out of here.
- No, wait.
I have to go back there again.
I have to see my parents.
All right, but it's gonna cost you.
- Five grand this time.
- No problem.
Don't move.
Lana?
My God, Lana, I...
I had no idea it was you.
I could have killed you.
If you needed money, all you had to do was ask.
I know.
Lex, I'm really sorry.
I didn't wanna have to lie to you.
- Just tell me what's wrong.
- There's nothing wrong with me.
You didn't wanna lie to me, but you broke into my house... and tried to steal from me.
You're acting like a junkie trying to find her next fix.
There's this guy at school.
- He's created these chemicals.
- So it is drugs.
No.
It's not what you think.
They kill you, and then they bring you back.
Lex, I died.
I died and I came back.
I'm telling the truth.
I went to the other side... and I saw my parents.
It was beautiful.
No one understands the loss of a parent more than I do.
And for you, growing up without a mother or father...
I can even understand taking whatever chance you did to see them again.
But you have to look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.
This isn't what your parents would have wanted for you.
Lex, I'm sorry.
I just...
I wanted to see them so badly.
I'm just so alone.
I think maybe it's "time..."
we both stop trying to hold on to the people we've "lost..."
and start turning to the ones we still have in our lives.
Yeah, I think you're right.
- You're freezing.
- Oh, no, I'm okay.
No, I'm gonna get you a blanket.
- Señor Fine?
- Señor Fine.
Hello?
Lex?
No.
No, I don't know where she is, but I can find out.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
We need to talk.
Lana warned us her roommate was nosy.
You look worse than Lana.
So you're gonna go all Mrs. Brady on me?
Bring me some chicken soup?
No.
I'm here because I'm worried about my friend.
Lana's boyfriend just broke up with her.
She's really vulnerable and depressed.
The last thing she needs is to flunk out of school because she's out partying.
- And you think it's your business?
- I know it's my business.
If you don't tell me what you guys are taking all night...
I'll make it the university's business too.
Chill.
Lana hasn't been "partying..."
and she isn't moping around, mourning her high-school sweetheart.
Well, she isn't exactly acting like herself.
The two of you look like poster children for the Betty Ford Clinic.
Look, I told you to let it go.
Now I'm done talking with you.
No.
What is she taking?
Drugs?
You're so small-minded.
No wonder Lana came to us.
Came to you for what?
That's between Lana and her loved ones.
Alley, what is it?
What's happening?
Near-death experience.
It's a compound, meteor rock.
Oh, my God.
I need an ambulance, please.
It's an emergency.
At Poss House, room 1170.
Please, I don't wanna die.
Oh, God.
Lance?
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of the evidence.
Evidence?
Alley, she's dead.
What?
What happened to her?
I warned her there's only so many times you could die before you stay that way.
Did your serum kill her?
My serum didn't do anything.
She did it to herself.
Well, I'm willing to take my chances.
I need you to send me back.
Are you out of your mind?
The police could be here any minute.
I gotta get out of here.
- Then we better hurry.
- What the hell is this?
Those are the keys to a very expensive Porsche, parked outside.
Figured they'd cover the cost for one more trip to the other side.
- You stole a Porsche?
- No.
I borrowed it from a friend.
And he wants it back.
Lex.
Cool thing about expensive cars, they all come with GPS tracking.
Lex, I can explain.
Lex?
Lex Luthor?
Dumb bitch.
I never should have let you in on this.
- Lance, please wait.
- I'm out of here.
You're not going till the authorities get...
Lana!
Say goodbye, jackass.
I'm gone.
Mom?
I used to practice this for hours when you were young.
Before Julian was born.
You'd sit next to me, quiet as a mouse.
Such a good little boy.
Never could get that part right.
I was injected with a hypodermic full of some kind of chemical.
- I must have gone into shock and...
- Now you're dead.
This is just a delusion.
Like last time?
What was it then that brought you to me?
Oh, yes.
You were shot after meeting with the man you hired... to destroy Jonathan Kent's "reputation..."
so you could become senator.
How'd that turn out, by the way?
If you're my dead mother, wouldn't you know?
It was a rhetorical question, Alexander.
Of course I know.
You ignored everything I showed you.
The life you could've had, if only you had made a different choice.
And what choice is that?
You think the path you've chosen isn't going to hurt?
It will.
More than you can ever imagine.
You're not the only one that's going to suffer.
Feel the beautiful flowers, laid barren by an emptiness that can never be filled.
Unless I keep you here.
Stay with me, Alexander.
Don't let the blood wash away what's left of your soul.
What are you talking about?
What blood?
Of all the people you're going to murder.
No!
My God, this stuff's got a kick.
- What happened?
- I was looking for Lana... and I found your body.
I figured, if the green stuff killed you, the other one would bring you back.
What?
You were already dead.
I figured I'd take a chance.
- We have to help Lana.
- Lana was here?
Where is she, Lex?
Chloe, I got your message.
What happened?
- Lex died.
- What?
Don't worry, I brought him back to life.
He said Lana's about to take a cruise down the river Styx if we don't find her.
- Chloe, what's happening?
- You want the short story?
Lana and her friends have been taking trips to the great beyond.
They're using a meteor-rock cocktail to prolong their near-death experience.
But if we don't find her in "time..."
she may never come back from her next little jaunt.
So they kill themselves and come back to life?
- Yeah.
- Why would Lana do something like that?
Because she's hurting, Clark.
I mean, she won't talk to you or to me.
Maybe she seeks comfort from the people who care about her most.
The two people she knows love her unconditionally.
- Her parents.
- Yes.
How are we gonna find her?
Well, thanks to Homeland Security... being on a college campus is akin to wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.
A student ID can be tracked anywhere, anytime.
All we have to do is find out where she's been using it and hope she's still alive.
Figured I'd find a junkie where needles are.
Let me help.
Tell Alley I said hi.
Lana, are you okay?
Clark, please help me.
I need them.
I need them.
Lana.
Please.
Clark!
Clark!
Do you know how much trouble you caused me?
You freshmen...
We need to help him.
Or choice B.
I take care of both of you.
Clark.
Clark.
Dad.
Hello, son.
I can't believe it's you.
You don't belong here, Clark.
You have to go back.
Dad, you don't know how hard it's been.
All I've done is hurt everyone that's close to me.
That's not true, son.
You died because of me.
When Jor-El brought me back to life and restored my powers... he" told me there'd be a price:
The life of someone I love.
I'm sorry, Dad.
- I'm so sorry.
- Clark... believe me, you have nothing to be sorry about.
I lived a...
A full, wonderful life.
I had everything that a husband or a...
A father... could ever possibly dream of.
I am so very proud... that I died protecting you.
Protecting me from what?
Lionel Luthor, Clark.
He knows your secret.
He knows everything.
You can't stay here, son.
You've gotta keep your mother safe.
You've gotta keep the whole world safe.
- No, Dad.
- Clark...
Not without you.
Dad, I need you.
I cannot do this without you.
Yes, you can.
This is your destiny, son.
You are going to touch the lives of so many people.
Not just as a man, but as a...
As a symbol.
You're a symbol of peace.
You're a symbol of justice.
And now it's time for you to go.
Clark.
- No, not yet!
- I'll always be with you, son.
- "Clark!"
- Always.
Clark, please.
Clark!
Clark.
Mom?
!
- Mom!
- Clark.
Just the man I was looking for.
What do you think?
You look amazing.
Well, if I can avoid dumping soup in my lap in front of the governor...
No, you'll do great.
What's wrong?
Mom, there's something I need to talk to you about.
He's early.
I'm sorry.
Well, don't you look dashing.
Next to you, I'm a man in rags.
You should always wear that color, Martha.
Doesn't she look beautiful, Clark?
We'll talk tomorrow, sweetie.
- Your carriage awaits, senator.
- Good night, Clark.
Good night, Clark.
So apparently, actually dying neutralized the kryptonite in your system.
- That's good to know.
- Yeah.
Although, it's nothing I ever plan to try again.
Wise decision.
Did you find out about your professor?
Has Milton Fine been resurrected?
Fine was definitely in Honduras with the black ship.
I just don't know how.
Well, I'll reach out to my source and see if they know anything else.
Don't worry, you won the first fight.
My money's on you in the rematch.
Fine's not the only thing we need to worry about.
When I was injected with the serum and died, I saw my father.
Oh, my God.
Clark.
Yeah, he told me that there's someone else who knows my secret.
Lionel Luthor.
Well, you can't be sure.
What you saw... it could have been a hallucination.
You know, a manifestation of your desires and fears.
Chloe, I could feel my father.
It was real.
I know it in my heart.
Well, the source that led me to Fine was Lionel.
- What?
Why didn't you tell me?
- He made me promise to keep quiet... under the umbrella of a reporter-source confidentiality.
He knew exactly how to play me.
He may be playing all of us.
It's beautiful.
It's my favorite.
- Lex...
- Is this gonna be another apology?
Well, they don't make a card for "Sorry I got you killed."
You weren't yourself.
I know what that's like.
Trust me.
I'm glad you're all right.
That I didn't end up like Alley.
I have to admit... crossing over was a very enlightening experience.
What did you see?
My mother.
What'd she say?
She said that...
She's very proud of the man I'm becoming.
She should be.
Clark, hi.
How you doing?
Well, to be honest, I've felt a lot better.
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna hurt anyone.
Except yourself.
No, that's...
I didn't want that, either.
Well, then, why were you doing it?
It wasn't because of us, Clark.
It was...
Well, it was a lot of things.
I've felt alone for a very long "time..."
even when I was around other people.
Even when I was with you.
I guess I just wanted to feel their arms again.
Feel their warmth.
Did you?
Almost.
But it'll have to do.
Because I won't let myself be that dependent again.
No matter what I'm searching for.
I hope so.
Lana?
All I want is for you to be happy.
I will be.
You're late.
Was there a problem with the cash?
No, the money wasn't the problem.
I had to ditch my roommate.
You don't know my roommate.
Here, $2000, the rest of my savings.
No worries, Lana, we're just about fixed for your fix.
This is not a drug trip.
Relax, Lance, just a little syringe-speak humor.
I wasn't implying that it's a hallucination.
Damn straight.
This little cocktail is my lock on a Nobel Prize.
And a big fat deal with the pharmaceutical company.
I wanna stay down longer this time.
- Two minutes.
- Forget it.
- It's too dangerous.
- Come on, Lance.
It's only 20 seconds longer than last time, and I almost found them.
What could it hurt?
I've been down almost as long.
You know you can bring her back.
Mom.
Dad.
Oh, my God.
I never thought I'd see you again.
- I've missed you so much.
- Oh, we've missed you too, honey.
I've just been so confused, I didn't know where to turn.
- We know how hard it's been.
- I loved him so much.
- I thought I could handle it.
- We're here for you, Lana.
No!
No!
No...
- I got her.
- Lana, chill, you're good.
Back among the living.
You were gone too long.
We almost didn't get you back.
Wait.
It wasn't long enough.
I have to go back.
Clark?
We've got a problem.
Fast, but oddly formal.
Usually when I say it's urgent you rip in here without the least regard for my privacy.

Maybe not, but it doesn't really look like all nighters agree with you.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Because you don't look okay.
Lana, I know that clark's breakup's been really difficult, but... chloe, it's not like someone died.
All right?
People break up every day.
It's not a big deal.
I'll get over it.
In short, this minor tax increase can make a major difference in our public schools.
Senator, how do you feel about clayton's allegations that your proposal will drain money from constituents failing to help schools?

We're both going to that dinner tomorrow night at the governor's mansion.

I understand.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man?
Can I see that?
Between the two is the labrum, or articular cartilage.
Divide the deltoid and its attachments, then you'll cut through the humerus.
Okay, you need to come through the bone two inches below the joint.
- Lance.
- What are you doing here?
I have to do it again soon.
You keep your voice down.
You could get us expelled.
- Get out of here.
- No, wait.
I have to go back there again.
I have to see my parents.
All right, but it's gonna cost you.
- Five grand this time.
- No problem.
Don't move.
Lana?
My God, Lana, I...
I had no idea it was you.
I could have killed you.
If you needed money, all you had to do was ask.
I know.
Lex, I'm really sorry.
I didn't wanna have to lie to you.
- Just tell me what's wrong.
- There's nothing wrong with me.
You didn't wanna lie to me, but you broke into my house and tried to steal from me.
You're acting like a junkie trying to find her next fix.
There's this guy at school.
- He's created these chemicals.
- So it is drugs.
No.
It's not what you think.
They kill you, and then they bring you back.
Lex, I died.
I died and I came back.
I'm telling the truth.
I went to the other side and I saw my parents.
It was beautiful.
No one understands the loss of a parent more than I do.
And for you, growing up without a mother or father I can even understand taking whatever chance you did to see them again.
But you have to look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.
This isn't what your parents would have wanted for you.
Lex, I'm sorry.
I just...
I wanted to see them so badly.
I'm just so alone.
I think maybe it's time we both stop trying to hold on to the people we've lost and start turning to the ones we still have in our lives.
Yeah, I think you're right.
- You're freezing.
- Oh, no, I'm okay.
No, I'm gonna get you a blanket.
- Senor Fine?
- Senor Fine.
Hello?
Lex?
No.
No, I don't know where she is, but I can find out.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
We need to talk.
Lana warned us her roommate was nosy.
You look worse than Lana.
So you're gonna go all Mrs. Brady on me?
Bring me some chicken soup?
No.
I'm here because I'm worried about my friend.
Lana's boyfriend just broke up with her.
She's really vulnerable and depressed.
The last thing she needs is to flunk out of school because she's out partying.
- And you think it's your business?
- I know it's my business.
If you don't tell me what you guys are taking all night I'll make it the university's business too.
Chill.
Lana hasn't been partying and she isn't moping around, mourning her high-school sweetheart.
Well, she isn't exactly acting like herself.
The two of you look like poster children for the Betty Ford Clinic.
Look, I told you to let it go.
Now I'm done talking with you.
No.
What is she taking?
Drugs?
You're so small-minded.
No wonder Lana came to us.
Came to you for what?
That's between Lana and her loved ones.
Alley, what is it?
What's happening?
Near-death experience.
It's a compound, meteor rock.
Oh, my God.
I need an ambulance, please.
It's an emergency.
At Poss House, room 1170.
Please, I don't wanna die.
Oh, God.
Lance?
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of the evidence.
Evidence?
Alley, she's dead.
What?
What happened to her?
I warned her there's only so many times you could die before you stay that way.
Did your serum kill her?
My serum didn't do anything.
She did it to herself.
Well, I'm willing to take my chances.
I need you to send me back.
Are you out of your mind?
The police could be here any minute.
I gotta get out of here.
- Then we better hurry.
- What the hell is this?
Those are the keys to a very expensive Porsche, parked outside.
Figured they'd cover the cost for one more trip to the other side.
- You stole a Porsche?
- No.
I borrowed it from a friend.
And he wants it back.
Lex.
Cool thing about expensive cars, they all come with GPS tracking.
Lex, I can explain.
Lex?
Lex Luthor?
Dumb bitch.
I never should have let you in on this.
- Lance, please wait.
- I'm out of here.
You're not going till the authorities get...
Lana!
Say goodbye, jackass.
I'm gone.
Mom?
I used to practice this for hours when you were young.
Before Julian was born.
You'd sit next to me, quiet as a mouse.
Such a good little boy.
Never could get that part right.
I was injected with a hypodermic full of some kind of chemical.
- I must have gone into shock and...
- Now you're dead.
This is just a delusion.
Like last time?
What was it then that brought you to me?
Oh, yes.
You were shot after meeting with the man you hired to destroy Jonathan Kent's reputation so you could become senator.
How'd that turn out, by the way?
If you're my dead mother, wouldn't you know?
It was a rhetorical question, Alexander.
Of course I know.
You ignored everything I showed you.
The life you could've had, if only you had made a different choice.
And what choice is that?
You think the path you've chosen isn't going to hurt?
It will.
More than you can ever imagine.
You're not the only one that's going to suffer.
Feel the beautiful flowers, laid barren by an emptiness that can never be filled.
Unless I keep you here.
Stay with me, Alexander.
Don't let the blood wash away what's left of your soul.
What are you talking about?
What blood?
Of all the people you're going to murder.
No!
My God, this stuff's got a kick.
- What happened?
- I was looking for Lana and I found your body.
I figured, if the green stuff killed you, the other one would bring you back.
What?
You were already dead.
I figured I'd take a chance.
- We have to help Lana.
- Lana was here?
Where is she, Lex?
Chloe, I got your message.
What happened?
- Lex died.
- What?
Don't worry, I brought him back to life.
He said Lana's about to take a cruise down the river Styx if we don't find her.
- Chloe, what's happening?
- You want the short story?
Lana and her friends have been taking trips to the great beyond.
They're using a meteor-rock cocktail to prolong their near-death experience.
But if we don't find her in time she may never come back from her next little jaunt.
So they kill themselves and come back to life?
- Yeah.
- Why would Lana do something like that?
Because she's hurting, clark.
I mean, she won't talk to you or to me.
Maybe she seeks comfort from the people who care about her most.
The two people she knows love her unconditionally.
- Her parents.
- Yes.
How are we gonna find her?
Well, thanks to Homeland Security being on a college campus is akin to wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.
A student ID can be tracked anywhere, anytime.
All we have to do is find out where she's been using it and hope she's still alive.
Figured I'd find a junkie where needles are.
Let me help.
Tell Alley I said hi.
Lana, are you okay?
Clark, please help me.
I need them.
I need them.
Lana.
Please.
Clark!
Clark!
Do you know how much trouble you caused me?
You freshmen...
We need to help him.
Or choice B.
I take care of both of you.
Clark.
Clark.
Dad.
Hello, son.
I can't believe it's you.
You don't belong here, clark.
You have to go back.
Dad, you don't know how hard it's been.
All I've done is hurt everyone that's close to me.
That's not true, son.
You died because of me.
When Jor-El brought me back to life and restored my powers he told me there'd be a price:
The life of someone I love.
I'm sorry, Dad.
- I'm so sorry.
- Clark believe me, you have nothing to be sorry about.
I lived a...
A full, wonderful life.
I had everything that a husband or a...
A father could ever possibly dream of.
I am so very proud that I died protecting you.
Protecting me from what?
Lionel Luthor, Clark.
He knows your secret.
He knows everything.
You can't stay here, son.
You've gotta keep your mother safe.
You've gotta keep the whole world safe.
- No, Dad.
- Clark...
Not without you.
Dad, I need you.
I cannot do this without you.
Yes, you can.
This is your destiny, son.
You are going to touch the lives of so many people.
Not just as a man, but as a...
As a symbol.
You're a symbol of peace.
You're a symbol of justice.
And now it's time for you to go.
Clark.
- No, not yet!
- I'll always be with you, son.
- Clark!
- Always.
Clark, please.
Clark!
Clark.
Mom?
!
- Mom!
- Clark.
Just the man I was looking for.
What do you think?
You look amazing.
Well, if I can avoid dumping soup in my lap in front of the governor...
No, you'll do great.
What's wrong?
Mom, there's something I need to talk to you about.
He's early.
I'm sorry.
Well, don't you look dashing.
Next to you, I'm a man in rags.
You should always wear that color, Martha.
Doesn't she look beautiful, clark?
We'll talk tomorrow, sweetie.
- Your carriage awaits, senator.
- Good night, Clark.
Good night, Clark.
So apparently, actually dying neutralized the kryptonite in your system.
- That's good to know.
- Yeah.
Although, it's nothing I ever plan to try again.
Wise decision.
Did you find out about your professor?
Has Milton Fine been resurrected?
Fine was definitely in Honduras with the black ship.
I just don't know how.
Well, I'll reach out to my source and see if they know anything else.
Don't worry, you won the first fight.
My money's on you in the rematch.
Fine's not the only thing we need to worry about.
When I was injected with the serum and died, I saw my father.
Oh, my God.
Clark.
Yeah, he told me that there's someone else who knows my secret.
Lionel Luthor.
Well, you can't be sure.
What you saw it could have been a hallucination.
You know, a manifestation of your desires and fears.
Chloe, I could feel my father.
It was real.
I know it in my heart.
Well, the source that led me to Fine was Lionel.
- What?
Why didn't you tell me?
- He made me promise to keep quiet under the umbrella of a reporter-source confidentiality.
He knew exactly how to play me.
He may be playing all of us.
It's beautiful.
It's my favorite.
- Lex...
- Is this gonna be another apology?
Well, they don't make a card for "Sorry I got you killed."
You weren't yourself.
I know what that's like.
Trust me.
I'm glad you're all right.
That I didn't end up like Alley.
I have to admit crossing over was a very enlightening experience.
What did you see?
My mother.
What'd she say?
She said that...
She's very proud of the man I'm becoming.
She should be.
Clark, hi.
How you doing?
Well, to be honest, I've felt a lot better.
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna hurt anyone.
Except yourself.
No, that's...
I didn't want that, either.
Well, then, why were you doing it?
It wasn't because of us, clark.
It was...
Well, it was a lot of things.
I've felt alone for a very long time even when I was around other people.
Even when I was with you.
I guess I just wanted to feel their arms again.
Feel their warmth.
Did you?
Almost.
But it'll have to do.
Because I won't let myself be that dependent again.
No matter what I'm searching for.
I hope so.
Lana?
All I want is for you to be happy.
I will be.
you're late.
hope there wasn't a problem with the cash.
no, the money wasn't the problem.
i had to ditch my roommate.
you don't know my roommate.
here, $2,000, the rest of my savings.
no worries, lana, we're just about fixed for your fix.
this is not a drug trip.
relax, lance, just a little syringe-speak humor.
i wasn't implying that it's hallucination.
damn straight.
this little cocktail is my lock on a nobel prize.
and a big, fat deal with the pharmaceutical company.
i want to stay down longer this time.
two minutes.
forget it.
it's too dangerous.
come on, lance. it's only 20 seconds longer than last time, and i almost found them.
what could it hurt ?
i've been down almost as long.
you know you can bring her back.
mom... dad.
oh, my god.
i never thought i'd see you again.
i've missed you so much.
oh, we've missed you, too, honey.
i've just been so confused.
i didn't know where to turn.
we know how hard it's been.
i loved him so much.
i thought i could handle it.
we're here for you, lana.
nooo !
nooo !
no !
i got her !
chill, lana. chill. you're good.
back among the living.
you were gone too long. we almost didn't get you back.
wait, it wasn't long enough. i have to go back.
"Void"
clark, we've got a problem.
fast but oddly formal.
usually when i say it's urgent, you whip in here without the least regard for my privacy.
i didn't want to disturb you.
don't worry, lana's not here.
actually, she didn't come home at all last night.
it's not another guy.
she's just been hanging out with these med students, and they keep really wicked hours.
but you know, clark, it will happen.
eventually, she will find someone else.
she deserves to be happy.
what's our crisis ?
mass destruction and death in central america and the possibility that your former professor milton fine is involved.
he's dead.
i know we thought we saw him die, but the only thing we're really sure of is that he disappeared, and so did that ship.
where'd you get this ?
a source tipped me off.
catch you later, lana.
yeah.
I call you later.
sorry.
you guys are friends.
it was bound to happen sometime, right ?
um, i didn't think you'd be back.
so, should i even bother asking you what you were up to last night ?
just hanging out, chloe. it was no big deal.
maybe not.
but it doesn't really look like all-nighters agree with you.
are you okay ?
i'm okay.
'cause you don't look okay.
iana, i know that clark's breakup has been really difficult but... chloe, it's not like someone died, all right ?
people break up every day.
it's not a big deal. i'll get over it.
in short, this minor tax increase can make a major difference in our public schools.
senator, how do you feel about clayton's allegations that your proposal will drain money from your constituents while failing to help schools ?
i'd be more than happy to respond to the congressman's concerns should congressman clayton care to ask me in person.
thank you very much for coming.
nice strategy, senator.
when attacked, don't hesitate, come out fighting.
i meant what i said.
a public debate is what i'm hoping for, but i'd hate to have to go through this every time.
you won't.
it'll get easier once you've made it clear you're a player.
i've brought you something.
something that just might give you a bit of an edge.
we're both going to that dinner tomorrow night at the governor's mansion.
a copy of my research.
everything there is to know about our dinner companions.
believe it or not, lionel, i've done my homework.
i know each person's position and what their voting record is.
what i don't know is why you're doing this.
i am not trying to manipulate your vote, martha.
look at it.
congressman clayton plays polo ?
hmm, his passion.
- his daughter's a gymnast.
- olympic standard.
look, it may be a political function, but in my experience, the last thing anyone wants to do over dinner is talk shop.
it's just another way to connect with your colleagues.
why don't we go together tomorrow night ?
i'll help you navigate the rough waters.
thank you.
but, lionel... i hope you're not expecting something on a personal level.
the two of us will never be anything more than friends.
i understand.
excuse me, have you seen this man ?
can i see that ?
first we'll divide the deltoid and its attachments.
then you'll cut through the proximal humerus.
okay, you need to come through the bone two inches below the joint.
lance.
what are you doing here ?
i have to do it again soon.
you keep your voice down.
you could get us expelled. get out of here.
no, wait !
i have to go back there again.
i have to see my parents.
all right, but it's gonna cost you.
5 grand this time.
no problem.
don't move !
iana ?
my god, lana, i had no idea it was you.
i could have killed you.
if you needed money, all you had to do was ask.
i know.
lex, i'm really sorry.
i didn't want to have to lie to you.
just tell me what's wrong.
there's nothing wrong with me.
you didn't want to lie to me, but you broke into my house and tried to steal from me.
you're acting like a junkie trying to find her next fix.
there's this guy at school.
he's created these chemicals.
so it is drugs.
no.
it's not what you think.
they kill you, and then they bring you back.
lex, i died.
i died, and i came back.
i'm telling the truth.
i went to the other side.
and i saw my parents.
and it was beautiful.
no one understands the loss of a parent more than i do.
and for you... growing up without a mother or father,
i can even understand taking whatever chance you did to see them again, but you have to look at yourself.
look at what you've become.
this isn't what your parents would have wanted for you.
lex, i'm sorry.
i just... i wanted to see them so badly.
and i'm just so alone.
i think maybe it's time we both stopped trying to hold on to the people we've lost, and start turning to the ones we still have in our lives.
yeah, i think you're right.
- you're freezing.
- no, i'm okay.
i'm gonna get you a blanket.
- señor fine ?
- señor fine, sí.
hello.
lex ?
no. no, i don't know where she is, but i can find out.
i'll call you as soon as i know anything.
we need to talk.
iana warned us her roommate was nosey.
you look worse than lana.
so, you're gonna go all "mrs. brady" on me, bring me some chicken soup ?
no. i'm here because i'm worried about my friend.
look, lana's boyfriend just broke up with her, and she's really vulnerable and depressed right now.
the last thing she needs is to flunk out of school because she's out all night partying.
- and you think it's your business ?
- yeah, i know it's my business.
and if you don't tell me what you guys are up taking all night, i'll make it the university's business, too.
chill.
iana hasn't been partying, and she isn't moping around mourning her high school sweetheart either.
well, she isn't exactly acting like herself.
and the two of you look like the poster children for the betty ford clinic.
look, i told you to let it go.
now i'm done talking with you.
no. what is she taking ?
drugs ?
you're so small-minded.
no wonder lana came to us.
came to you for what ?
that's between lana and her loved ones.
ally, what is it ?
what's happening ?
near-death experience.
it's a compound... meteor rock.
oh, my god.
i need an ambulance, please. it's an emergency.
crosshouse, room 1170.
please, i don't want to die.
oh, god.
lance ?
- what are you doing ?
- getting rid of the evidence.
evidence ?
ally. she's dead.
what ?
what happened to her ?
i warned her there's only so many times you could die before you stay that way.
did your serum kill her ?

the cool thing about expensive cars...

lex ?
lex luthor ?
dumb bitch.
- i never should have let you in on this.
- no, lance, please, wait.
i'm out of here.
you're not going anywhere until the authorities get here.
iana !
say goodbye, jackass. i'm gone.
mom ?
i used to practice this for hours when you were young.

if you really are my dead mother, wouldn't you know ?
it was a rhetorical question, alexander.
of course i know.

if only you had made a different choice.
and what choice would that be ?
you think the path you've chosen isn't going to hurt ?
it will.
more than you can ever imagine.
you're not the only one that's going to suffer.
a field of beautiful flowers lay barren by an emptiness that can never be filled unless i keep you here.
stay with me, alexander.
don't let the blood wash away what's left of your soul.
what are you talking about ?
what blood ?
of all the people you're going to murder.
Noooo !
god, this stuff's got a kick.

iana was here ?
where is she, lex ?
chloe. i got your message. what happened ?
- lex died.
- what ?
don't worry. i brought him back to life.
but he said lana's about to take a one-way cruise down the river styx if we don't find her soon.
chloe, what's happened ?
okay, you want the short story ?
iana and her new friends have been taking daily trips to the great beyond.
they're using a meteor-rock cocktail to prolong their near-death experience.
but if we don't find her in time, she may never come back from her next little jaunt.
so they're killing themselves and coming back to life ?
yeah.
why would lana do something so dangerous ?
because she's hurting, clark.
i mean, she won't talk to you.
she hasn't talked to me, so maybe she's looking for comfort from the two people who care about her most.
you know, the two people she knows love her unconditionally.
- her parents.
- yes.
how are we gonna find her ?
well, thanks to homeland security, being on a college campus is akin to wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.
the student i. d. can be tracked anywhere at any time, so all we have to do is find out where's she's been using it and hope that she's still alive.
ah, i figured i'd find a junkie where the needles are.
let me help.
tell ally i said hi.
are you okay ?
clark, please help me. i need them.
iana.
please.
clark !
clark !
you know how much trouble you caused me ?
freshmen.
we need to help him.
or choice "b."
i'll take care of both of you.
clark !
clark !
dad.
hello, son.
i can't believe it's you.
you don't belong here, clark. you have to go back.

- Clark.
not without you.

- i cannot do this without you.
- yes, you can.
this is your destiny, son.
you are going to touch the lives of so many people.
not just as a man, but as a... as a symbol.
you're a symbol of peace.
you're a symbol of justice.
and now it's time for you to go.

no, that's... i didn't want that either.
then why were you doing it ?
it wasn't because of us, clark.
it was... well, it was a lot of things.
i've felt alone for a very long time, even when i was around other people even when i was with you.
i guess i just wanted to feel their arms again, feel their warmth.
did you ?
almost.
but it'll have to do because i won't let myself be that dependent again,
no matter what i'm searching for.
i hope so.
iana all i want is for you to be happy.
i will be.
you're late.
hope there wasn't a problem with the cash.
no, the money wasn't the problem.
i had to ditch my roommate.
you don't know my roommate.
here, $2,000, the rest of my savings.
no worries, lana, we're just about fixed for your fix.
this is not a drug trip.
relax, lance, just a little syringe-speak humor.
i wasn't implying that it's hallucination.
damn straight.
this little cocktail is my lock on a nobel prize.
and a big, fat deal with the pharmaceutical company.
i want to stay down longer this time.
two minutes.
forget it.
it's too dangerous.
come on, lance. it's only 20 seconds longer than last time, and i almost found them.
what could it hurt ?
i've been down almost as long.
you know you can bring her back.
mom... dad.
oh, my god.
i never thought i'd see you again.
i've missed you so much.
oh, we've missed you, too, honey.
i've just been so confused.
i didn't know where to turn.
we know how hard it's been.
i loved him so much.
i thought i could handle it.
we're here for you, lana.
nooo !
nooo !
no !
i got her !
chill, lana. chill. you're good.
back among the living.
you were gone too long. we almost didn't get you back.
wait, it wasn't long enough. i have to go back.
"Void"
clark, we've got a problem.
fast but oddly formal.
usually when i say it's urgent, you whip in here without the least regard for my privacy.
i didn't want to disturb you.
don't worry, lana's not here.
actually, she didn't come home at all last night.
it's not another guy.
she's just been hanging out with these med students, and they keep really wicked hours.
but you know, clark, it will happen.
eventually, she will find someone else.
she deserves to be happy.
what's our crisis ?
mass destruction and death in central america and the possibility that your former professor milton fine is involved.
he's dead.
i know we thought we saw him die, but the only thing we're really sure of is that he disappeared, and so did that ship.
where'd you get this ?
a source tipped me off.
catch you later, lana.
yeah.
I call you later.
sorry.
you guys are friends.
it was bound to happen sometime, right ?
um, i didn't think you'd be back.
so, should i even bother asking you what you were up to last night ?
just hanging out, chloe. it was no big deal.
maybe not.
but it doesn't really look like all-nighters agree with you.
are you okay ?
i'm okay.
'cause you don't look okay.
iana, i know that clark's breakup has been really difficult but... chloe, it's not like someone died, all right ?
people break up every day.
it's not a big deal. i'll get over it.
in short, this minor tax increase can make a major difference in our public schools.
senator, how do you feel about clayton's allegations that your proposal will drain money from your constituents while failing to help schools ?
i'd be more than happy to respond to the congressman's concerns should congressman clayton care to ask me in person.
thank you very much for coming.
nice strategy, senator.
when attacked, don't hesitate, come out fighting.
i meant what i said.
a public debate is what i'm hoping for, but i'd hate to have to go through this every time.
you won't.
it'll get easier once you've made it clear you're a player.
i've brought you something.
something that just might give you a bit of an edge.
we're both going to that dinner tomorrow night at the governor's mansion.
a copy of my research.
everything there is to know about our dinner companions.
believe it or not, lionel, i've done my homework.
i know each person's position and what their voting record is.
what i don't know is why you're doing this.
i am not trying to manipulate your vote, martha.
look at it.
congressman clayton plays polo ?
hmm, his passion.
- his daughter's a gymnast.
- olympic standard.
look, it may be a political function, but in my experience, the last thing anyone wants to do over dinner is talk shop.
it's just another way to connect with your colleagues.
why don't we go together tomorrow night ?
i'll help you navigate the rough waters.
thank you.
but, lionel... i hope you're not expecting something on a personal level.
the two of us will never be anything more than friends.
i understand.
excuse me, have you seen this man ?
can i see that ?
first we'll divide the deltoid and its attachments.
then you'll cut through the proximal humerus.
okay, you need to come through the bone two inches below the joint.
lance.
what are you doing here ?
i have to do it again soon.
you keep your voice down.
you could get us expelled. get out of here.
no, wait !
i have to go back there again.
i have to see my parents.
all right, but it's gonna cost you.
5 grand this time.
no problem.
don't move !
iana ?
my god, lana, i had no idea it was you.
i could have killed you.
if you needed money, all you had to do was ask.
i know.
lex, i'm really sorry.
i didn't want to have to lie to you.
just tell me what's wrong.
there's nothing wrong with me.
you didn't want to lie to me, but you broke into my house and tried to steal from me.
you're acting like a junkie trying to find her next fix.
there's this guy at school.
he's created these chemicals.
so it is drugs.
no.
it's not what you think.
they kill you, and then they bring you back.
lex, i died.
i died, and i came back.
i'm telling the truth.
i went to the other side.
and i saw my parents.
and it was beautiful.
no one understands the loss of a parent more than i do.
and for you... growing up without a mother or father,
i can even understand taking whatever chance you did to see them again, but you have to look at yourself.
look at what you've become.
this isn't what your parents would have wanted for you.
lex, i'm sorry.
i just... i wanted to see them so badly.
and i'm just so alone.
i think maybe it's time we both stopped trying to hold on to the people we've lost, and start turning to the ones we still have in our lives.
yeah, i think you're right.
- you're freezing.
- no, i'm okay.
i'm gonna get you a blanket.
- señor fine ?
- señor fine, sí.
hello.
lex ?
no. no, i don't know where she is, but i can find out.
i'll call you as soon as i know anything.
we need to talk.
iana warned us her roommate was nosey.
you look worse than lana.
so, you're gonna go all "mrs. brady" on me, bring me some chicken soup ?
no. i'm here because i'm worried about my friend.
look, lana's boyfriend just broke up with her, and she's really vulnerable and depressed right now.
the last thing she needs is to flunk out of school because she's out all night partying.
- and you think it's your business ?
- yeah, i know it's my business.
and if you don't tell me what you guys are up taking all night, i'll make it the university's business, too.
chill.
iana hasn't been partying, and she isn't moping around mourning her high school sweetheart either.
well, she isn't exactly acting like herself.
and the two of you look like the poster children for the betty ford clinic.
look, i told you to let it go.
now i'm done talking with you.
no. what is she taking ?
drugs ?
you're so small-minded.
no wonder lana came to us.
came to you for what ?
that's between lana and her loved ones.
ally, what is it ?
what's happening ?
near-death experience.
it's a compound... meteor rock.
oh, my god.
i need an ambulance, please. it's an emergency.
crosshouse, room 1170.
please, i don't want to die.
oh, god.
lance ?
- what are you doing ?
- getting rid of the evidence.
evidence ?
ally. she's dead.
what ?
what happened to her ?
i warned her there's only so many times you could die before you stay that way.
did your serum kill her ?
my serum didn't do anything. she did it to herself.
well, i'm willing to take my chances.
i need you to send me back.
you out of your mind ?
the police could be here any minute.
i got to get out of here.
then we better hurry.
what the hell is this ?
those are the keys to a very expensive porsche which is parked outside.
i figured they'd cover the cost for one more trip to the other side.
you stole a porsche ?
no, i borrowed it from a friend.
and he wants it back.
lex.
the cool thing about expensive cars...
they all come with gps tracking.
lex, i can explain.
lex ?
lex luthor ?
dumb bitch.
- i never should have let you in on this.
- no, lance, please, wait.
i'm out of here.
you're not going anywhere until the authorities get here.
iana !
say goodbye, jackass. i'm gone.
mom ?
i used to practice this for hours when you were young.
before julian was born.
you'd sit next to me, quiet as a mouse.
such a good little boy.
never could get that part right.
i was injected with a hypodermic full of some kind of chemical.
- i must have gone into shock.
- no, you're dead.
this is just a delusion.
like last time ?
what was it then that brought you to me ?
oh. yes.
you were shot coming out of a meeting with the man you hired to destroy jonathan kent's reputation... so you could become senator.
how'd that turn out, by the way ?
if you really are my dead mother, wouldn't you know ?
it was a rhetorical question, alexander.
of course i know.
you ignored everything i showed you... the life you could have had.
if only you had made a different choice.
and what choice would that be ?
you think the path you've chosen isn't going to hurt ?
it will.
more than you can ever imagine.
you're not the only one that's going to suffer.
a field of beautiful flowers lay barren by an emptiness that can never be filled unless i keep you here.
stay with me, alexander.
don't let the blood wash away what's left of your soul.
what are you talking about ?
what blood ?
of all the people you're going to murder.
Noooo !
god, this stuff's got a kick.
what happened ?
well, i was looking for lana, and i found your body.
i figured, if the green stuff killed you, the other one would bring you back.
what ?
you were already dead.
i figured i'd take a chance.
we have to help lana.
iana was here ?
where is she, lex ?
chloe. i got your message. what happened ?
- lex died.
- what ?
don't worry. i brought him back to life.
but he said lana's about to take a one-way cruise down the river styx if we don't find her soon.
chloe, what's happened ?
okay, you want the short story ?
iana and her new friends have been taking daily trips to the great beyond.
they're using a meteor-rock cocktail to prolong their near-death experience.
but if we don't find her in time, she may never come back from her next little jaunt.
so they're killing themselves and coming back to life ?
yeah.
why would lana do something so dangerous ?
because she's hurting, clark.
i mean, she won't talk to you.
she hasn't talked to me, so maybe she's looking for comfort from the two people who care about her most.
you know, the two people she knows love her unconditionally.
- her parents.
- yes.
how are we gonna find her ?
well, thanks to homeland security, being on a college campus is akin to wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.
the student i. d. can be tracked anywhere at any time, so all we have to do is find out where's she's been using it and hope that she's still alive.
ah, i figured i'd find a junkie where the needles are.
let me help.
tell ally i said hi.
are you okay ?
clark, please help me. i need them.
iana.
please.
clark !
clark !
you know how much trouble you caused me ?
freshmen.
we need to help him.
or choice "b."
i'll take care of both of you.
clark !
clark !
dad.
hello, son.
i can't believe it's you.
you don't belong here, clark. you have to go back.
dad, you don't know how hard it's been.
all i've done is hurt everyone that's close to me.
that's not true, son.
you died because of me.
when jor-el brought me back to life and restored my powers he told me there'd be a price... the life of someone i love.
i'm sorry, dad.
- i'm so sorry.
- clark... believe me, you have nothing to be sorry about.
i lived a full, wonderful life.
i had everything that a husband or a father could ever possibly dream of.
i am so very proud that i died protecting you.
protecting me from what ?
lionel luthor, clark.
he knows your secret.
he knows everything.
you can't stay here, son.
you've got to keep your mother safe.
you've got to keep the whole world safe.
- no, dad.
- Clark.
not without you.
dad, i need you.
- i cannot do this without you.
- yes, you can.
this is your destiny, son.
you are going to touch the lives of so many people.
not just as a man, but as a... as a symbol.
you're a symbol of peace.
you're a symbol of justice.
and now it's time for you to go.
clark !
no !
not yet !
i'll always be with you, son.
always.
clark, please.
clark !
mom ?
mom ?
clark.
just the man i was looking for.
what do you think ?
you look amazing.
well, if i can avoid dumping soup in my lap in front of the governor.
no, you'll do great.
what's wrong ?
mom, there's something i need to talk to you about.
he's early. i'm sorry.
well, don't you look dashing.
next to you, i'm a man in rags.
you should always wear that color, martha.
doesn't she look beautiful, clark ?
we'll talk tomorrow, sweetie.
your carriage awaits, senator.
goodnight, clark.
goodnight... clark.
so, apparently, actually dying neutralized the kryptonite in your system.
that's good to know.
yeah, although it's nothing i ever plan to try again.
wise decision.
what did you find out about your favorite professor ?
has milton fine been resurrected ?
fine was definitely in honduras with the black ship.
i just don't know how.
i'll reach out to my source and see if they know anything else.
don't worry about it. you won the first fight.
my money's on you in the rematch.
chloe, i don't think fine is the only thing we need to worry about.
when i was injected with the serum and died, i saw my father.
oh, my god, clark.
yeah, he told me that there's someone else who knows my secret... lionel luthor.
well, you can't be sure.
i mean, what you saw, it could have been a hallucination.
you know, a manifestation of your desires and fears.
chloe, i could feel my father.
it was real.
i know it in my heart.
well, the source that led me to fine was lionel.
what ?
why didn't you tell me ?
clark, he made me promise to keep his involvement quiet, under the umbrella of a reporter/source confidentiality.
he knew exactly how to play me.
he may be playing all of us.
it's beautiful.
it's my favorite.
lex... is this gonna be another apology ?
well, they don't make a card for "sorry i got you killed."
you weren't yourself.
i know what that's like, trust me.
i'm glad you're all right.
that i didn't end up like ally.
i have to admit, crossing over was a very enlightening experience.
what did you see ?
my mother.
what'd she say ?
she said that she's very proud of the man i'm becoming.
she should be.
clark. hi.
how you doing ?
um, well, to be honest, i've felt a lot better.
i'm sorry. i didn't want to hurt anyone.
except yourself.
no, that's... i didn't want that either.
then why were you doing it ?
it wasn't because of us, clark.
it was... well, it was a lot of things.
i've felt alone for a very long time, even when i was around other people even when i was with you.
i guess i just wanted to feel their arms again, feel their warmth.
did you ?
almost.
but it'll have to do because i won't let myself be that dependent again,
no matter what i'm searching for.
i hope so.
iana all i want is for you to be happy.
i will be.
You're late.
Was there a problem with the cash?
No, the money wasn't the problem.
I had to ditch my roommate.
You don't know my roommate.
Here, $2000, the rest of my savings.
No worries, Lana, we're just about fixed for your fix.
This is not a drug trip.
Relax, Lance, just a little syringe-speak humor.
I wasn't implying that it's a hallucination.
Damn straight.
This little cocktail is my lock on a Nobel Prize.
And a big fat deal with the pharmaceutical company.
I wanna stay down longer this time.
- Two minutes.
- Forget it.
- It's too dangerous.
- Come on, Lance.
It's only 20 seconds longer than last time, and I almost found them.
What could it hurt?
I've been down almost as long.
You know you can bring her back.
Mom.
Dad.
Oh, my God.
I never thought I'd see you again.
- I've missed you so much.
- Oh, we've missed you too, honey.
I've just been so confused, I didn't know where to turn.
- We know how hard it's been.
- I loved him so much.
- I thought I could handle it.
- We're here for you, Lana.
No!
No!
No...
- I got her.
- Lana, chill, you're good.
Back among the living.
You were gone too long.
We almost didn't get you back.
Wait.
It wasn't long enough.
I have to go back.
Clark?
We've got a problem.
Fast, but oddly formal.
Usually when I say it's urgent you rip in here without the least regard for my privacy.
- I didn't wanna disturb you.

So should I even bother asking what you were up to last night?
Just hanging out, Chloe, it was no big deal.
Maybe not, but it doesn't really look like all nighters agree with you.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Because you don't look okay.
Lana, I know that clark's breakup's been really difficult, but... chloe, it's not like someone died.
All right?
People break up every day.
It's not a big deal.
I'll get over it.
In short, this minor tax increase can make a major difference in our public schools.
Senator, how do you feel about clayton's allegations that your proposal will drain money from constituents failing to help schools?
I'd be more than happy to respond to the congressman's concerns should Congressman Clayton care to ask me in person.

Something that just might give you a bit of an edge.
We're both going to that dinner tomorrow night at the governor's mansion.
A copy of my research.
Everything there is to know about our dinner companions.
Believe it or not, Lionel, I've done my homework.
I know each person's position and what their voting record is.
What I don't know is why you're doing this.
I am not trying to manipulate your vote, Martha.

Thank you.
But, Lionel, I hope you're not expecting something on a personal level.
The two of us will never be anything more than friends.
I understand.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man?
Can I see that?
Between the two is the labrum, or articular cartilage.
Divide the deltoid and its attachments, then you'll cut through the humerus.
Okay, you need to come through the bone two inches below the joint.
- Lance.
- What are you doing here?
I have to do it again soon.
You keep your voice down.
You could get us expelled.
- Get out of here.
- No, wait.
I have to go back there again.
I have to see my parents.
All right, but it's gonna cost you.
- Five grand this time.
- No problem.
Don't move.
Lana?
My God, Lana, I...
I had no idea it was you.
I could have killed you.
If you needed money, all you had to do was ask.
I know.
Lex, I'm really sorry.
I didn't wanna have to lie to you.
- Just tell me what's wrong.
- There's nothing wrong with me.
You didn't wanna lie to me, but you broke into my house and tried to steal from me.
You're acting like a junkie trying to find her next fix.
There's this guy at school.
- He's created these chemicals.

No.
It's not what you think.

No one understands the loss of a parent more than I do.
And for you, growing up without a mother or father I can even understand taking whatever chance you did to see them again.

I think maybe it's time we both stop trying to hold on to the people we've lost and start turning to the ones we still have in our lives.
Yeah, I think you're right.
- You're freezing.
- Oh, no, I'm okay.
No, I'm gonna get you a blanket.
- Senor Fine?
- Senor Fine.
Hello?
Lex?
No.
No, I don't know where she is, but I can find out.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
We need to talk.
Lana warned us her roommate was nosy.
You look worse than Lana.
So you're gonna go all Mrs. Brady on me?
Bring me some chicken soup?
No.
I'm here because I'm worried about my friend.
Lana's boyfriend just broke up with her.
She's really vulnerable and depressed.
The last thing she needs is to flunk out of school because she's out partying.
- And you think it's your business?
- I know it's my business.
If you don't tell me what you guys are taking all night I'll make it the university's business too.
Chill.
Lana hasn't been partying and she isn't moping around, mourning her high-school sweetheart.
Well, she isn't exactly acting like herself.
The two of you look like poster children for the Betty Ford Clinic.
Look, I told you to let it go.
Now I'm done talking with you.
No.
What is she taking?
Drugs?
You're so small-minded.
No wonder Lana came to us.
Came to you for what?
That's between Lana and her loved ones.
Alley, what is it?
What's happening?
Near-death experience.
It's a compound, meteor rock.
Oh, my God.
I need an ambulance, please.
It's an emergency.
At Poss House, room 1170.
Please, I don't wanna die.
Oh, God.
Lance?
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of the evidence.
Evidence?
Alley, she's dead.
What?
What happened to her?
I warned her there's only so many times you could die before you stay that way.
Did your serum kill her?
My serum didn't do anything.
She did it to herself.
Well, I'm willing to take my chances.
I need you to send me back.
Are you out of your mind?
The police could be here any minute.
I gotta get out of here.

- What the hell is this?
Those are the keys to a very expensive Porsche, parked outside.
Figured they'd cover the cost for one more trip to the other side.
- You stole a Porsche?
- No.
I borrowed it from a friend.
And he wants it back.
Lex.
Cool thing about expensive cars, they all come with GPS tracking.
Lex, I can explain.
Lex?
Lex Luthor?
Dumb bitch.
I never should have let you in on this.
- Lance, please wait.
- I'm out of here.
You're not going till the authorities get...
Lana!
Say goodbye, jackass.
I'm gone.
Mom?
I used to practice this for hours when you were young.
Before Julian was born.
You'd sit next to me, quiet as a mouse.
Such a good little boy.
Never could get that part right.
I was injected with a hypodermic full of some kind of chemical.
- I must have gone into shock and...
- Now you're dead.
This is just a delusion.
Like last time?
What was it then that brought you to me?
Oh, yes.
You were shot after meeting with the man you hired to destroy Jonathan Kent's reputation so you could become senator.
How'd that turn out, by the way?
If you're my dead mother, wouldn't you know?
It was a rhetorical question, Alexander.
Of course I know.
You ignored everything I showed you.
The life you could've had, if only you had made a different choice.
And what choice is that?
You think the path you've chosen isn't going to hurt?
It will.
More than you can ever imagine.
You're not the only one that's going to suffer.
Feel the beautiful flowers, laid barren by an emptiness that can never be filled.
Unless I keep you here.
Stay with me, Alexander.
Don't let the blood wash away what's left of your soul.
What are you talking about?
What blood?
Of all the people you're going to murder.
No!
My God, this stuff's got a kick.
- What happened?
- I was looking for Lana and I found your body.
I figured, if the green stuff killed you, the other one would bring you back.
What?
You were already dead.
I figured I'd take a chance.
- We have to help Lana.
- Lana was here?
Where is she, Lex?
Chloe, I got your message.
What happened?
- Lex died.
- What?
Don't worry, I brought him back to life.
He said Lana's about to take a cruise down the river Styx if we don't find her.
- Chloe, what's happening?
- You want the short story?
Lana and her friends have been taking trips to the great beyond.
They're using a meteor-rock cocktail to prolong their near-death experience.
But if we don't find her in time she may never come back from her next little jaunt.
So they kill themselves and come back to life?
- Yeah.
- Why would Lana do something like that?
Because she's hurting, clark.
I mean, she won't talk to you or to me.
Maybe she seeks comfort from the people who care about her most.
The two people she knows love her unconditionally.
- Her parents.
- Yes.
How are we gonna find her?
Well, thanks to Homeland Security being on a college campus is akin to wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.
A student ID can be tracked anywhere, anytime.
All we have to do is find out where she's been using it and hope she's still alive.
Figured I'd find a junkie where needles are.
Let me help.
Tell Alley I said hi.
Lana, are you okay?
Clark, please help me.
I need them.
I need them.
Lana.
Please.
Clark!
Clark!
Do you know how much trouble you caused me?
You freshmen...
We need to help him.
Or choice B.
I take care of both of you.
Clark.
Clark.
Dad.
Hello, son.
I can't believe it's you.
You don't belong here, clark.
You have to go back.
Dad, you don't know how hard it's been.
All I've done is hurt everyone that's close to me.
That's not true, son.
You died because of me.
When Jor-El brought me back to life and restored my powers he told me there'd be a price:
The life of someone I love.
I'm sorry, Dad.
- I'm so sorry.
- Clark believe me, you have nothing to be sorry about.
I lived a...
A full, wonderful life.
I had everything that a husband or a...
A father could ever possibly dream of.
I am so very proud that I died protecting you.
Protecting me from what?
Lionel Luthor, Clark.
He knows your secret.
He knows everything.
You can't stay here, son.
You've gotta keep your mother safe.
You've gotta keep the whole world safe.
- No, Dad.
- Clark...
Not without you.
Dad, I need you.
I cannot do this without you.
Yes, you can.
This is your destiny, son.
You are going to touch the lives of so many people.
Not just as a man, but as a...
As a symbol.
You're a symbol of peace.
You're a symbol of justice.
And now it's time for you to go.
Clark.
- No, not yet!
- I'll always be with you, son.
- Clark!
- Always.
Clark, please.
Clark!
Clark.
Mom?
!
- Mom!
- Clark.
Just the man I was looking for.
What do you think?
You look amazing.
Well, if I can avoid dumping soup in my lap in front of the governor...
No, you'll do great.
What's wrong?
Mom, there's something I need to talk to you about.
He's early.
I'm sorry.
Well, don't you look dashing.
Next to you, I'm a man in rags.
You should always wear that color, Martha.
Doesn't she look beautiful, clark?
We'll talk tomorrow, sweetie.
- Your carriage awaits, senator.
- Good night, Clark.
Good night, Clark.
So apparently, actually dying neutralized the kryptonite in your system.
- That's good to know.
- Yeah.
Although, it's nothing I ever plan to try again.
Wise decision.
Did you find out about your professor?
Has Milton Fine been resurrected?
Fine was definitely in Honduras with the black ship.
I just don't know how.
Well, I'll reach out to my source and see if they know anything else.
Don't worry, you won the first fight.
My money's on you in the rematch.
Fine's not the only thing we need to worry about.
When I was injected with the serum and died, I saw my father.
Oh, my God.
Clark.
Yeah, he told me that there's someone else who knows my secret.
Lionel Luthor.
Well, you can't be sure.
What you saw it could have been a hallucination.
You know, a manifestation of your desires and fears.
Chloe, I could feel my father.
It was real.
I know it in my heart.
Well, the source that led me to Fine was Lionel.
- What?
Why didn't you tell me?
- He made me promise to keep quiet under the umbrella of a reporter-source confidentiality.
He knew exactly how to play me.
He may be playing all of us.
It's beautiful.
It's my favorite.
- Lex...
- Is this gonna be another apology?
Well, they don't make a card for "Sorry I got you killed."
You weren't yourself.
I know what that's like.
Trust me.
I'm glad you're all right.
That I didn't end up like Alley.
I have to admit crossing over was a very enlightening experience.
What did you see?
My mother.
What'd she say?
She said that...
She's very proud of the man I'm becoming.
She should be.
Clark, hi.
How you doing?
Well, to be honest, I've felt a lot better.
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna hurt anyone.
Except yourself.
No, that's...
I didn't want that, either.
Well, then, why were you doing it?
It wasn't because of us, clark.
It was...
Well, it was a lot of things.
I've felt alone for a very long time even when I was around other people.
Even when I was with you.
I guess I just wanted to feel their arms again.
Feel their warmth.
Did you?
Almost.
But it'll have to do.
Because I won't let myself be that dependent again.
No matter what I'm searching for.
I hope so.
Lana?
All I want is for you to be happy.
I will be.

You're late.
Was there a problem with the cash?
No, the money wasn't the problem.
I had to ditch my roommate.
You don't know my roommate.
Here, $2000, the rest of my savings.
No worries, Lana, we're just about fixed for your fix.
This is not a drug trip.
Relax, Lance, just a little syringe-speak humor.
I wasn't implying that it's a hallucination.
Damn straight.
This little cocktail is my lock on a Nobel Prize.
And a big fat deal with the pharmaceutical company.
I wanna stay down longer this time.
- Two minutes.
- Forget it.
- It's too dangerous.
- Come on, Lance.
It's only 20 seconds longer than last time, and I almost found them.
What could it hurt?
I've been down almost as long.
You know you can bring her back.
Mom.
Dad.
Oh, my God.
I never thought I'd see you again.
- I've missed you so much.
- Oh, we've missed you too, honey.
I've just been so confused, I didn't know where to turn.
- We know how hard it's been.
- I loved him so much.
- I thought I could handle it.
- We're here for you, Lana.
No!
No!
No...
- I got her.
- Lana, chill, you're good.
Back among the living.
You were gone too long.
We almost didn't get you back.
Wait.
It wasn't long enough.
I have to go back.
Clark?
We've got a problem.
Fast, but oddly formal.
Usually when I say it's "urgent..."
...you rip in here without the least regard for my privacy.
- I didn't wanna disturb you.
- Don't worry, Lana's not here.
Actually, she didn't come home at all last night.
It's not another guy.
She's been hanging out with these med students and they keep really wicked hours.
But you know, Clark, it will happen.
Eventually she will find someone else.
Yeah, she deserves to be happy.
What's our crisis?
Mass destruction and death in Central America.
And the possibility that your former professor, Milton Fine, is involved.
- No, he's dead.
- I know we thought we saw him die.
But the only thing we're really sure "of..."
...is that he disappeared, and so did that ship.
- Where'd you get this?
- A source tipped me off.
- Catch you later, Lana.
- Yeah.
I'll call you later.
- Sorry.
- You guys are friends.
It was bound to happen sometime, right?
I didn't think you'd be back.
So should I even bother asking what you were up to last night?
Just hanging out, Chloe, it was no big deal.
Maybe not, but it doesn't really look like all nighters agree with you.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Because you don't look okay.
Lana, I know that Clark's breakup's been really difficult, but...
Chloe, it's not like someone died.
All right?
People break up every day.
It's not a big deal.
I'll get over it.
In short, this minor tax increase can make a major difference in our public schools.
Senator, how do you feel about Clayton's "allegations..."
...that your proposal will drain money from constituents failing to help schools?
I'd be more than happy to respond to the congressman's "concerns..."
...should Congressman Clayton care to ask me in person.
- Thank you very much for coming.
- Well, thank you, senator.
Nice strategy, senator.
When attacked, don't hesitate, come out fighting.
I meant what I said.
A public debate is what I'm hoping for.
I'd hate to have to go through this every time.
You won't.
It'll get easier once you've made it clear you're a player.
I've...
I brought you something.
Something that just might give you a bit of an edge.
We're both going to that dinner tomorrow night...
"...at" the governor's mansion.
A copy of my research.
Everything there is to know about our dinner companions.
Believe it or not, Lionel, I've done my homework.
I know each person's position and what their voting record is.
What I don't know is why you're doing this.
I am not trying to manipulate your vote, Martha.
Look at it.
- Congressman Clayton plays polo?
- His passion.
- His daughter's a gymnast.
- Olympic standard.
Look, it may be a political function, but in my experience the last thing anyone wants to do over dinner is talk shop.
Just...
It's another way to connect with your colleagues.
Why don't we go together tomorrow night?
I'll help you navigate the rough waters.
Thank you.
But, Lionel, I hope you're not expecting something on a personal level.
The two of us will never be anything more than friends.
I understand.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man?
Can I see that?
Between the two is the labrum, or articular cartilage.
Divide the deltoid and its attachments, then you'll cut through the humerus.
Okay, you need to come through the bone two inches below the joint.
- Lance.
- What are you doing here?
I have to do it again soon.
You keep your voice down.
You could get us expelled.
- Get out of here.
- No, wait.
I have to go back there again.
I have to see my parents.
All right, but it's gonna cost you.
- Five grand this time.
- No problem.
Don't move.
Lana?
My God, Lana, I...
I had no idea it was you.
I could have killed you.
If you needed money, all you had to do was ask.
I know.
Lex, I'm really sorry.
I didn't wanna have to lie to you.
- Just tell me what's wrong.
- There's nothing wrong with me.
You didn't wanna lie to me, but you broke into my house and tried to steal from me.
You're acting like a junkie trying to find her next fix.
There's this guy at school.
- He's created these chemicals.
- So it is drugs.
No.
It's not what you think.
They kill you, and then they bring you back.
Lex, I died.
I died and I came back.
I'm telling the truth.
I went to the other side and I saw my parents.
It was beautiful.
No one understands the loss of a parent more than I do.
And for you, growing up without a mother or father I can even understand taking whatever chance you did to see them again.
But you have to look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.
This isn't what your parents would have wanted for you.
Lex, I'm sorry.
I just...
I wanted to see them so badly.
I'm just so alone.
I think maybe it's "time..."
...we both stop trying to hold on to the people we've "lost..."
...and start turning to the ones we still have in our lives.
Yeah, I think you're right.
- You're freezing.
- Oh, no, I'm okay.
No, I'm gonna get you a blanket.
- Señor Fine?
- Señor Fine.
Hello?
Lex?
No.
No, I don't know where she is, but I can find out.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
We need to talk.
Lana warned us her roommate was nosy.
You look worse than Lana.
So you're gonna go all Mrs. Brady on me?
Bring me some chicken soup?
No.
I'm here because I'm worried about my friend.
Lana's boyfriend just broke up with her.
She's really vulnerable and depressed.
The last thing she needs is to flunk out of school because she's out partying.
- And you think it's your business?
- I know it's my business.
If you don't tell me what you guys are taking all night...
"...
I'll" make it the university's business too.
Chill.
Lana hasn't been "partying..."
"...and" she isn't moping around, mourning her high-school sweetheart.
Well, she isn't exactly acting like herself.
The two of you look like poster children for the Betty Ford Clinic.
Look, I told you to let it go.
Now I'm done talking with you.
No.
What is she taking?
Drugs?
You're so small-minded.
No wonder Lana came to us.
Came to you for what?
That's between Lana and her loved ones.
Alley, what is it?
What's happening?
Near-death experience.
It's a compound, meteor rock.
Oh, my God.
I need an ambulance, please.
It's an emergency.
At Poss House, room 1170.
Please, I don't wanna die.
Oh, God.
Lance?
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of the evidence.
Evidence?
Alley, she's dead.
What?
What happened to her?
I warned her there's only so many times you could die before you stay that way.
Did your serum kill her?
My serum didn't do anything.
She did it to herself.
Well, I'm willing to take my chances.
I need you to send me back.
Are you out of your mind?
The police could be here any minute.
I gotta get out of here.
- Then we better hurry.
- What the hell is this?
Those are the keys to a very expensive Porsche, parked outside.
Figured they'd cover the cost for one more trip to the other side.
- You stole a Porsche?
- No.
I borrowed it from a friend.
And he wants it back.
Lex.
Cool thing about expensive cars, they all come with GPS tracking.
Lex, I can explain.
Lex?
Lex Luthor?
Dumb bitch.
I never should have let you in on this.
- Lance, please wait.
- I'm out of here.
You're not going till the authorities get...
Lana!
Say goodbye, jackass.
I'm gone.
Mom?
I used to practice this for hours when you were young.
Before Julian was born.
You'd sit next to me, quiet as a mouse.
Such a good little boy.
Never could get that part right.
I was injected with a hypodermic full of some kind of chemical.
- I must have gone into shock and...
- Now you're dead.
This is just a delusion.
Like last time?
What was it then that brought you to me?
Oh, yes.
You were shot after meeting with the man you hired to destroy Jonathan Kent's "reputation..."
...so you could become senator.
How'd that turn out, by the way?
If you're my dead mother, wouldn't you know?
It was a rhetorical question, Alexander.
Of course I know.
You ignored everything I showed you.
The life you could've had, if only you had made a different choice.
And what choice is that?
You think the path you've chosen isn't going to hurt?
It will.
More than you can ever imagine.
You're not the only one that's going to suffer.
Feel the beautiful flowers, laid barren by an emptiness that can never be filled.
Unless I keep you here.
Stay with me, Alexander.
Don't let the blood wash away what's left of your soul.
What are you talking about?
What blood?
Of all the people you're going to murder.
No!
My God, this stuff's got a kick.
- What happened?
- I was looking for Lana and I found your body.
I figured, if the green stuff killed you, the other one would bring you back.
What?
You were already dead.
I figured I'd take a chance.
- We have to help Lana.
- Lana was here?
Where is she, Lex?
Chloe, I got your message.
What happened?
- Lex died.
- What?
Don't worry, I brought him back to life.
He said Lana's about to take a cruise down the river Styx if we don't find her.
- Chloe, what's happening?
- You want the short story?
Lana and her friends have been taking trips to the great beyond.
They're using a meteor-rock cocktail to prolong their near-death experience.
But if we don't find her in "time..."
...she may never come back from her next little jaunt.
So they kill themselves and come back to life?
- Yeah.
- Why would Lana do something like that?
Because she's hurting, Clark.
I mean, she won't talk to you or to me.
Maybe she seeks comfort from the people who care about her most.
The two people she knows love her unconditionally.
- Her parents.
- Yes.
How are we gonna find her?
Well, thanks to Homeland Security being on a college campus is akin to wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.
A student ID can be tracked anywhere, anytime.
All we have to do is find out where she's been using it and hope she's still alive.
Figured I'd find a junkie where needles are.
Let me help.
Tell Alley I said hi.
Lana, are you okay?
Clark, please help me.
I need them.
I need them.
Lana.
Please.
Clark!
Clark!
Do you know how much trouble you caused me?
You freshmen...
We need to help him.
Or choice B.
I take care of both of you.
Clark.
Clark.
Dad.
Hello, son.
I can't believe it's you.
You don't belong here, Clark.
You have to go back.
Dad, you don't know how hard it's been.
All I've done is hurt everyone that's close to me.
That's not true, son.
You died because of me.
When Jor-El brought me back to life and restored my powers...
"...he" told me there'd be a price:
The life of someone I love.
I'm sorry, Dad.
- I'm so sorry.
- Clark believe me, you have nothing to be sorry about.
I lived a...
A full, wonderful life.
I had everything that a husband or a...
A father could ever possibly dream of.
I am so very proud that I died protecting you.
Protecting me from what?
Lionel Luthor, Clark.
He knows your secret.
He knows everything.
You can't stay here, son.
You've gotta keep your mother safe.
You've gotta keep the whole world safe.
- No, Dad.
- Clark...
Not without you.
Dad, I need you.
I cannot do this without you.
Yes, you can.
This is your destiny, son.
You are going to touch the lives of so many people.
Not just as a man, but as a...
As a symbol.
You're a symbol of peace.
You're a symbol of justice.
And now it's time for you to go.
Clark.
- No, not yet!
- I'll always be with you, son.
- "Clark!"
- Always.
Clark, please.
Clark!
Clark.
Mom?
!
- Mom!
- Clark.
Just the man I was looking for.
What do you think?
You look amazing.
Well, if I can avoid dumping soup in my lap in front of the governor...
No, you'll do great.
What's wrong?
Mom, there's something I need to talk to you about.
He's early.
I'm sorry.
Well, don't you look dashing.
Next to you, I'm a man in rags.
You should always wear that color, Martha.
Doesn't she look beautiful, Clark?
We'll talk tomorrow, sweetie.
- Your carriage awaits, senator.
- Good night, Clark.
Good night, Clark.
So apparently, actually dying neutralized the kryptonite in your system.

Lana?
All I want is for you to be happy.
I will be.
Come on!
Anybody here?
You scared me!
Who is he?
The deaf mute.
So what do you want?
Go on.
Go on.
Shall I tell her?
She's possessed.
She doesn't talk, sleep or eat anymore.
There's a curse on her.
She says a snake's twisting in her belly.
How did it get in there?
- Go on.
Tell her.
- Come over here.
- You heard her.
- Come here.
When did it start?
When Don Ercole promised us to two rich Americans.
- Look at these.
- I don't understand words on paper.
No, these aren't words.
They're real things.
Look.
Look at the onion!
Is that money on the tree?
It's the new land.
Burn them.
Don't be afraid.
So what do we do?
Shall we remove it?
- I can't take it anymore!
- Get rid of that thing!
It's over.
Calm down now.
We're here.
We've brought the stones.
We wanted to ask you something.
What should we do?
Should we leave, or should we stay here?
Give us a sign, just a sign.
We'll wait here.
We won't move.
SALVATORE:
Blessed be the Lord.
- Zapparelli.
- Zapparelli.
Hey, there.
Get that goat.
- Where is he?
- Inside.
He's inside?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Here are our animals.
Take a look at them.
Take a look.
This one's stronger than a mare, and it hasn't even been a month since it was born.
Beautiful, huh?
Look at this one.
- You're sure this time?
- More than ever.
And your mother?
If she wants to come, fine.
If not, I'll leave her with you.
We're leaving.
We'll get you some clothes.
Leave the animals here.
Come in.
Come on.
Have a seat.
Take that hat off.
Take that thing off!
Hands off!
Lift your foot.
These boots used to belong to Giovanni Gramigna, a scoundrel with a heart of gold.
- They seem good to me.
- They are good.
Lift your foot.
Look at these wooden soles.
You'll never wear them out.
Your foot.
These belonged to the Baron's son, who died as a child.
Take my advice.
Don't put them on until you get to town.
Of course.
You understand?
These are the Baron's boots.
This here
is for Salvatore.
This, on the other hand, is for Angelo.
As for this, it's for Pietro.
It was Bastianuzzo's.
May he rest in peace.
These are clothes for a prince.
- I can't send you to America in rags.
- God will reward you.
Put them on.
Let's see what you look like.
How will I find my brother there?
Your brother, maybe he's someone important now.
Maybe he's changed his name, but he couldn't have changed his face.
You two are identical.
I bet they'll think you're him and even treat you like a king.
Know where the cloaks are from?
They belonged to the Puccia bandits.
That way, our dead will travel with you.
SALVATORE:
Come on.
Enough goodbyes!
Let's go!
Turn left.
ANGELO:
When did your brother leave?
SALVATORE:
When Pietro was born.
- Why didn't we leave, too?
- Because.
What's your brother like?
What do you mean?
He's my spitting image.
We're twins.
How can we be sure we'll find him?
Of course we'll find him.
He looks exactly like me.
SALVATORE:
Your clothes!
Stop!
Stop!
Enough!
You bloody fool!
Hold this!
Look at you!
- You're sick.
- Shut up!
Pick up your things.
Are you planning to go to America in rags?
Your shoes!
- I've lost my shoes.
- Too bad.
You'll walk to America barefoot, you fool.
- No!
- Find them.
Where are they?
- I'm cursed.
- I've got them.
Pick them up!
Get going!
Get!
Come on!
Your clothes!
Fold them up properly.
We have to arrive looking like princes!
Here.
Don't get it dirty.
I'm cursed.
Come on!
- Look at that!
- What?
Come on!
- Hey, you!
- FORTUNATA:
All the spirits are here!
They're angry with us.
They'll never let us leave!
Can't the spirits come with us?
They fear the sea.
They say thousands of evil souls fly above the sea.
So talk them round!
Damn me and my ancestors!
Do we have to stay here?
Are we going to die here?
A great life this is!
She thinks I'm afraid.
She thinks I'm afraid!
Let's stay, then.
Come out now.
SALVATORE:
Come on.
We have to go.
Mum, where are you going?
To look for you, wretch.
Your brother can't take anymore.
You left me here alone.
I want to see the new land, too.
- The poor thing, can he come?
- SALVATORE:
Mum!
I'm bringing him to you.
Come over here.
Come on.
Such grim looks!
Smile.
Smile.
Smile.
Smile.
Those who leave are seeds to be planted in more fertile land.
You're our future.
Embrace each other now.
Embrace each other as if you'll meet again soon.
That'll do.
Get ready.
God will guide you there.
Hurry up now.
Let's get going.
Salvatore, you see these two girls?
I'm entrusting them to you.
They have to arrive as they left.
- And how is that?
- As decent girls.
Come on!
Climb on, Pietro.
Come on!
Let's go!
Help me with the shoes!
MAN:
This is so fresh it'll last until America!
We don't want it!
FORTUNATA:
Salvatore, help me down!
SALVATORE:
Get your things.
Don't touch anything!
Pietro!
Where are you?
SALVATORE:
Don't get lost!
FORTUNATA:
Come over here!
Stick together!
We don't want it.
Keep moving!
Give us a break!
SALVATORE:
Move!
Move it!
What the hell do you want?
- You're leaving for America?
- Yes.
- You have to come with me.
- Why didn't you say so?
Can you take us to the doctor?
- Yes.
- So take us there!
- Are you ill?
- We're going to America.
Any rashes?
Stomach ache?
Any itches?
Let me see your tongue.
Got any fleas?
Any itching?
Are you blind, deaf or mute?
How do you feel?
Got a fever?
He's not speaking.
Is he mute?
This one's mute!
No, there's no mute here.
- They repatriate the deaf mutes.
- What do they do?
- They send them home.
- Where?
I can sell you a cure I've invented.
It makes the dead talk.
That's rubbish!
I'm a healer.
I know about doctor things.
Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but this cure for mutes is something you have to buy.
Let me see if you have fleas.
Stick your tongue out.
Come on!
- Move on!
Move on!
- Get out of here!
- Where are you taking that?
- To America.
- You have to pay.
- What?
- You have to pay for it.
- What?
- It only costs two cents.
- Two cents?
- Two cents.
- Why?
- Because it's for sale.
- What is it?
- Medicine for the teeth.
- For the teeth?
- He said it was for mutes!
- No, it's for teeth.
We don't need it, then.
Let's go.
Mancuso, four of us and these ladies who are getting married.
MAN:
Do you have photos?
Can I see them?
- Your photos.
- We don't have them.
Carmelo, get photos done for these four!
Okay.
Follow me.
Watch where you're going.
Off you go.
Off you go.
Next.
Come on.
- Miss, are you together?
- Yes.
- How many are you?
- Mancuso.
Your name?
Mancuso...
- MAN:
Your name?
- Mancuso, Salvatore.
Mancuso, Salvatore.

Angelo.
You?
What's your name?

Mancuso, Pietro.
And you, madam, what's your name?

- Fortunata.
- And you, miss?
- Rita.
- Rita.
What's your name?
- Rosa.
- Rosa.
And you, miss?
- Lucy.
Luce.
You can go.
Off you go!
Excuse me, miss.
Miss!
You with the red hair!
- I'm talking to you.
Is she with you?
- No!
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Italian.
- Are you English?
- Yes.
Do you speak English?
No.
You are wonderful, my darling.
- Traveling alone?
- Yes, with this family.
FORTUNATA:
Why are we still here?
Let's go.
Hey, I'm talking to the lady.
You have a boyfriend, America?
No.
No boyfriend, no America.
- You have a passport?
- No.
- You have money?
- Why?
Why?
Curious, huh?
I have a boyfriend for you, America.
I have, America.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Don't touch me.
- Sorry.
Where are you off to?
Get lost!
FORTUNATA:
Salvatore, what's she got to do with us?
Let's go.
Come on!
SALVATORE:
Whatever that medicine was, let's just get out of here.
Come on, Pietro.
MAN:
Third class!
Show your tickets!
Stick together!
Stick together!
Come on, Pietro.
MAN:
Where are you going?
SALVATORE:
Come back, you fool!
- Damn you!
- Stubborn idiot!
Stay with me, you blockhead!
Come on!
Come on!
Let us through!
No, not here.
Men here, women there.
All the women together, all the men together.
No pushing!
Stop pushing!
FORTUNATA:
Salvatore!
Get out of my way!
- Get your hands off me!
- She's my mother!
Mancuso, there are four of us.
We're all Mancusos.
MAN:
Yes, yes.
Men here, women there.
You stay with me.
Stay calm!
I have my whole family with me!
Excuse me, madam.
This is my bed.
- I'm here now.
- Look.
It's written here.
- I can't read.
- I'm sorry, madam.
ANGELO:
Dad!
SALVATORE:
Get a bed, Pietro.
That's good.
Take that one.
Good, Pietro.
ANGELO:
I'll go here.
Just below, Dad.
- Is your father comfortable?
- Yes.
He's an old man, you know.
- Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
- Spera, Calogero, from Realimici.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
- Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
- Mangiapane, Giuseppe, from Carini.
- Esposito, Nicola, from Cinisi.
- Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
This is my son.
Esposito, Nicola, from Cinisi.
I've never slept with so many foreigners before.
Foreigners?
But we're not foreigners!
We're all Italian.
- Italian?
- Italian.
- We don't speak the same way.
- Don't you know you're Italian?
If you say so.
If you know so much, tell me something.
- When do we see Big Luciano?
- Who?
He means the big ocean, the Atlantic.
- That's right.
- In a week or so.
Can you help me, please?
Thank you.
- Why turn your dress inside out?
- What?
Why did you turn your dress inside out?
To keep it clean on the journey.
- What's your name?
- Rita.
- What's the garlic for?
- So I won't fall ill.
- Want some?
- No, thanks.
It stinks.
- What's your name?
- Angela.
God only knows how long we're going to be stuck here, and this is just the beginning.
I never thought I'd live to see this.
- I should have stayed at home.
- Madam.
Madam.
Could you lower your voice?
I have a headache.
Then have one!
What do I care?
Who does she think she is?
This is the last thing I needed.
A journey like this ahead, and she has a headache.
There's nothing here.
- Nothing at all.
- We're on the sea.
Come over here.
Wait.
Come here, Mum.
Sit down here.
Sit down.
Sit down.
I could very easily find someone who would help you out of this mess,
someone who could give you a hand, perhaps someone who might even marry you.
It wouldn't be a terrible thing.
I could find you a very wealthy, well-positioned gentleman.
They have such big, fine horses because their streets are long.
I hear they even have rivers of milk in California.
I can't swim, but I wouldn't mind a dip in a river of milk.
Sure, maybe there are even flying donkeys that scatter money.
You really believe that?
Hey, Caruso.
Take this to Miss Luce.
T ell her that it's from Mr. Mangiapane.
Give this to Rita from Giovanni.
Excuse me.
What are you up to with Luce?
Nothing.
And you?
- She looked at me.
- At me, too.
How could she look at you if she looked at me?
- She looked at me.
- You're making it up.
You can't be serious.
Anyone can have her.
- You just have to pay.
- Pay?
With all due respect, you shouldn't talk like that.
Miss Luce is traveling with me, and no one is to disrespect her.
Leave it at that.
Miss Luce.
Miss Luce.
- My father sent this.
- Thank you.
- Where's your mother?
- She's dead.
She died long ago.
The lady's not interested in all that.
- Aren't you married?
- No.
- Don't you want to marry?
- That's enough!
Shut up now.
WOMAN:
Apparently, Miss Luce was married to a nobleman.
He was related to their king.
- He had a castle.
- She fell for an American.
She left her husband to go to America.
When she got there, her American didn't turn up.
- She couldn't get in alone.
- She's looking for a man now.
ANGELO:
They say Luce was married to a prince, but he had so many wives he sent her to America.
She's all on her own now, and she needs a man to care for her.
- Perhaps she's a queen.
- How should I know?
Signor Belvedere, Lucy.
Signor Belvedere is the largest purveyor of ice in New York City.
FORTUNATA:
The sleepwalker's back.
If you want my men's protection, you have to earn it.
Behave yourself like the rest of us.
My son's not right for you.
You're too foreign.
You need a man who can support you.
Look at your hands.
Why?
What's wrong with my hands?
Come here, Pietro!
Don't be scared.
Come with me.
You'll wake him!
Let go of me!
So where's America?
It's here, but you can't see it.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
You look younger without a mustache.
I'm still young, though.
Salvatore, would you marry me?
Who?
Me?
Of course.
Right away.
You're the one asking me?
I need a man to help me get in.
I'm here.
When can we get married?
When we reach the island, you'll have to call me out.
I'll call you right away.
I'm not scared.
I'm not marrying you for love.
Love?
We hardly know each other.
Those things take time.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right?
Yes.
Here's what we'll do.
Give me a lock of your hair.
Now we won't lose each other.
I don't believe in magic.
With time, I'll teach you.
- We don't have all day.

Up.
Don't worry.
It's all right.
Look down.
Open your eyes.
Keep still.
We won't hurt you.

Why don't you answer?
He's my son.
Can't you make him speak?
He's a stubborn one, but he works harder than a mule.

- Take your pants off.
Take them off.
Come on!
Come on!

- What are you doing?
Pietro.
Pietro, don't be afraid.

Step back, please.
He's still shaken from the journey, poor kid.
Follow me this way, please.
He'll do it now!
He'll do it now!
My son stays with...
Okay.
My son stays with me!

SALVATORE:
Don't worry, Pietro.
- My son...
- MAN:
Come.
Come.
Would you please lie down?
Lie down, madam.
Lie down on your side, please.
Like this, with your head here.
What's she doing?
Get your hands off.
What are you doing?
- Calm down.
It's procedure.
- Get your hands off me!
I don't want anyone touching me!
Excuse me.
Madam, this lady is not used to this kind of examination.
- Are you English, miss?
- Yes, I am.
- You came with Italians?
- Yes, ma'am.
Is your husband traveling with you?
My fiancé.
He's supposed to meet me here.
It is highly uncommon for an English lady to be traveling with Italians.
You'll be questioned about that.
MAN 1 :
Don't be afraid.
Take your time.
Think hard.
Math test.

You can put them here.
Bread and gold.
You're out at sea in a small boat.
There's a big storm.
There are two sacks in the boat.
One is full of bread, and the other, full of gold.
Which do you throw overboard?
Why throw them overboard?
Get rid of the gold?
I can't throw gold away.
MAN 1 :
He says he can't throw the gold.
I eat the bread.
MAN 1 :
He'd eat the bread.
I don't throw anything overboard.
Nothing.
He wouldn't throw anything.
Is that right?
Is it right?
I'm ready.
Done.
I love table games, sir.
May I ask, I thought you were looking for illnesses and contagious diseases here.
Unfortunately, ma'am, it has been scientifically proven that lack of intelligence is genetically inherited, hence contagious in a way.
We are trying to prevent below-average people from mixing with our citizens.
What a modern vision.
Let's try an exercise now.
I'll give you instructions, and you have to carry them out in order.
Open the door and put the chair near the door.
You have to do things in the order that I tell you.
First, you open the door, then you move the chair.
You got it wrong.
I asked you to open the door and then take the chair over to it.
Start again.
That's better.
Now open the door, put the chair near the door,
pick up the book and put it on the floor.

And you think you're God?
Who are you to decide if we're fit or not to enter this new world of yours?
Who do we think we are, God, to decide who's good or not good to enter the new world?

What are those long things?

They're houses, 1 00 floors high!
How do you get up there?
There's a wooden box that carries people up and down, on its own.
- On its own?
- On its own.
- Can animals go up, too?
- Everything can go up.
- I wouldn't like to go home in a box.

Mr. Mancuso, step forward.
Mr. Mancuso, your son is mute and cannot be admitted.
Your mother is feeble-minded and cannot be admitted.
What is your decision?
MAN:
Mr. Mancuso, your son is mute and cannot be admitted.
Your mother is feeble-minded and cannot be admitted.
What will you do now, continue the admission process or return home?
But...
Excuse me.
I...
I don't mean to be disrespectful,
but I don't understand.
What's wrong?
How can they be a problem?
How are my mother and my son a problem with all the land and work you have here?
Because he doesn't speak?
It's for the best, you know.
This way, he won't bore anyone.
He'll never complain.
And, my mother, look at her.
She's like a young girl.
True, she talks a lot, but I'll keep her indoors and won't let her out.
We've come all this way only to be parted now?
Dad,
Grandma told me she wants to go home.
She also told me that we have to stay.

You scared me!
Who is he?
The deaf mute.
So what do you want?
Go on.
Go on.
Shall I tell her?
She's possessed.
She doesn't talk, sleep or eat anymore.
There's a curse on her.
She says a snake's twisting in her belly.
How did it get in there?
-Go on.
Tell her.
-Come over here.
-You heard her.
-Come here.
When did it start?
When Don Ercole promised us to two rich Americans.
-Look at these.

No, these aren't words.
They're real things.
Look.
Look at the onion!
Is that money on the tree?

We're here.
We've brought the stones.
We wanted to ask you something.
What should we do?
Should we leave, or should we stay here?
Give us a sign, just a sign.

Hey, there.
Get that goat.
-Where is he?
-Inside.
He's inside?
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Here are our animals.
Take a look at them.
Take a look.
This one's stronger than a mare, and it hasn't even been a month since it was born.
Beautiful, huh?
Look at this one.
-You're sure this time?
-More than ever.
And your mother?
If she wants to come, fine.
If not, I'll leave her with you.
We're leaving.
We'll get you some clothes.
Leave the animals here.
Come in.
Come on.
Have a seat.
Take that hat off.
Take that thing off!
Hands off!
Lift your foot.
These boots used to belong to Giovanni Gramigna, a scoundrel with a heart of gold.
-They seem good to me.
-They are good.
Lift your foot.
Look at these wooden soles.
You'll never wear them out.
Your foot.
These belonged to the Baron's son, who died as a child.
Take my advice.
Don't put them on until you get to town.
Of course.
You understand?
These are the Baron's boots.
This here
is for Salvatore.
This, on the other hand, is for Angelo.
As for this, it's for Pietro.
It was Bastianuzzo's.
May he rest in peace.
These are clothes for a prince.
-I can't send you to America in rags.
-God will reward you.
Put them on.
Let's see what you look like.
How will I find my brother there?
Your brother, maybe he's someone important now.
Maybe he's changed his name, but he couldn't have changed his face.
You two are identical.
I bet they'll think you're him and even treat you like a king.
Know where the cloaks are from?
They belonged to the Puccia bandits.
That way, our dead will travel with you.
(BRAYING)
SALVATORE:
Come on.
Enough goodbyes!
Let's go!
Turn left.
ANGELO:
When did your brother leave?
SALVATORE:
When Pietro was born.
-Why didn't we leave, too?
-Because.
What's your brother like?
What do you mean?
He's my spitting image.
We're twins.
How can we be sure we'll find him?
Of course we'll find him.
He looks exactly like me.
SALVATORE:
Your clothes!
Stop!
Stop!
Enough!
You bloody fool!
Hold this!
Look at you!
-You're sick.
-Shut up!
Pick up your things.
Are you planning to go to America in rags?
Your shoes!
-I've lost my shoes.
-Too bad.
You'll walk to America barefoot, you fool.
-No!
-Find them.
Where are they?
-I'm cursed.
-I've got them.
Pick them up!
Get going!
Get!
Come on!
Your clothes!
Fold them up properly.
We have to arrive looking like princes!
Here.
Don't get it dirty.
I'm cursed.

Can't the spirits come with us?

They fear the sea.
They say thousands of evil souls fly above the sea.
So talk them round!
Damn me and my ancestors!
Do we have to stay here?
Are we going to die here?
A great life this is!

She thinks I'm afraid.

Come out now.
SALVATORE:

We have to go.
Mum, where are you going?
To look for you, wretch.
Your brother can't take anymore.
You left me here alone.
I want to see the new land, too.
-The poor thing, can he come?
-SALVATORE:
Mum!
I'm bringing him to you.
(WIND HOWLING)
Come over here.
Come on.
Such grim looks!
Smile.

Those who leave are seeds to be planted in more fertile land.
You're our future.
Embrace each other now.
Embrace each other as if you'll meet again soon.
That'll do.
Get ready.
God will guide you there.
Hurry up now.
Let's get going.
Salvatore, you see these two girls?
I'm entrusting them to you.
They have to arrive as they left.

Are you blind, deaf or mute?
How do you feel?

He's not speaking.
Is he mute?
This one's mute!
No, there's no mute here.
-They repatriate the deaf mutes.
-What do they do?
-They send them home.
-Where?
I can sell you a cure I've invented.
It makes the dead talk.
That's rubbish!
I'm a healer.
I know about doctor things.
Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but this cure for mutes is something you have to buy.
Let me see if you have fleas.
Stick your tongue out.

You can't be serious.
Anyone can have her.

-Can animals go up, too?
-Everything can go up.
-I wouldn't like to go home in a box.
-Me, neither.
-My house has to be on the ground.
-I'd like a house in the sky.
What are you doing?
Get down now!
(MUTTERING PRAYERS)
-What do we do?
Pray, too?
-Our Father or Ave Maria?
Let's say them all.
"In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit..."
It's like eating a cloud.
God be praised.

What will you do now, continue the admission process or return home?
But...
Excuse me.
I...
I don't mean to be disrespectful,
but I don't understand.
What's wrong?
How can they be a problem?
How are my mother and my son a problem with all the land and work you have here?
Because he doesn't speak?
It's for the best, you know.
This way, he won't bore anyone.
He'll never complain.
And, my mother, look at her.
She's like a young girl.
True, she talks a lot, but I'll keep her indoors and won't let her out.
We've come all this way only to be parted now?
Dad,
Grandma told me she wants to go home.
She also told me that we have to stay.

You are wonderful, my darling.

You have a boyfriend, America?

Curious, huh?
I have a boyfriend for you, America.
I have, America.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Don't touch me.
- Sorry.
I could very easily find someone who would help you out of this mess,
someone who could give you a hand, perhaps someone who might even marry you.
It wouldn't be a terrible thing.
I could find you a very wealthy, well-positioned gentleman.
Signor Belvedere is the largest purveyor of ice in New York City.
Stand behind the line, please.
Please circle over.
Please.
All right.
All right, hold it.
Hats off, sir.

Madam, this lady is not used to this kind of examination.
- Are you English, miss?
- Yes, I am.
- You came with Italians?
- Yes, ma'am.
Is your husband traveling with you?
My fiancé.
He's supposed to meet me here.
It is highly uncommon for an English lady to be traveling with Italians.
You'll be questioned about that.
Math test.
Four and two.
Okay.
Bread and gold.
He says he can't throw the gold.
He'd eat the bread.
Nothing.
He wouldn't throw anything.
I'm ready.
Done.
I love table games, sir.
May I ask, I thought you were looking for illnesses and contagious diseases here.
Unfortunately, ma'am, it has been scientifically proven that lack of intelligence is genetically inherited, hence contagious in a way.
We are trying to prevent below-average people from mixing with our citizens.

Please take the note.
The gentlemen have the notes.

This lady here?

Would you hand me the notes?
This is for you.
Take it.
It's for you.
Mrs. Fortunata Mancuso.
She wants to know what all these shapes are, sir.
Does she think we're going to harm her?
What do we want from them?
Them who?
All the folk who came over from the old world.
Would you explain to her that we want to know if they're fit enough to enter the new world?
Who do we think we are, God, to decide who's good or not good to enter the new world?
If she wants to enter the United States, she's got to accept our rules.
If she refuses to take the test, she will be deported.
Mr. Marcello Tarsitano.
The wedding will take place on the 17th of the current month
- at Ellis Island.

It's a difficult name for him to pronounce.

The wedding will take place at Ellis Island.
Mr. Salvatore Mancuso, step forward.
Mr. Mancuso, your son is mute and cannot be admitted.
Your mother is feeble-minded and cannot be admitted.
What is your decision?
Come on!
Anybody here?
You scared me!
Who is he?
The deaf mute.
So what do you want?
Go on.
Go on.
Shall I tell her?
She's possessed.
She doesn't talk, sleep or eat anymore.
There's a curse on her.
She says a snake's twisting in her belly.
How did it get in there?
-Go on.
Tell her.
-Come over here.
-You heard her.
-Come here.
When did it start?
When Don Ercole promised us to two rich Americans.
-Look at these.
-I don't understand words on paper.
No, these aren't words.
They're real things.
Look.
Look at the onion!
Is that money on the tree?
It's the new land.
Burn them.
Don't be afraid.
So what do we do?
Shall we remove it?
-I can't take it anymore!
-Get rid of that thing!
It's over.
Calm down now.
We're here.
We've brought the stones.
We wanted to ask you something.
What should we do?
Should we leave, or should we stay here?
Give us a sign, just a sign.
We'll wait here.
We won't move.
Blessed be the Lord.
-Zapparelli.
-Zapparelli.
Hey, there.
Get that goat.
-Where is he?
-Inside.
He's inside?
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Here are our animals.
Take a look at them.
Take a look.
This one's stronger than a mare, and it hasn't even been a month since it was born.
Beautiful, huh?
Look at this one.
-You're sure this time?
-More than ever.
And your mother?
If she wants to come, fine.
If not, I'll leave her with you.
We're leaving.
We'll get you some clothes.
Leave the animals here.
Come in.
Come on.
Have a seat.
Take that hat off.
Take that thing off!
Hands off!
Lift your foot.
These boots used to belong to Giovanni Gramigna, a scoundrel with a heart of gold.
-They seem good to me.
-They are good.
Lift your foot.
Look at these wooden soles.
You'll never wear them out.
Your foot.
These belonged to the Baron's son, who died as a child.
Take my advice.
Don't put them on until you get to town.
Of course.
You understand?
These are the Baron's boots.
This here
is for Salvatore.
This, on the other hand, is for Angelo.
As for this, it's for Pietro.
It was Bastianuzzo's.
May he rest in peace.
These are clothes for a prince.
-I can't send you to America in rags.
-God will reward you.
Put them on.
Let's see what you look like.
How will I find my brother there?
Your brother, maybe he's someone important now.
Maybe he's changed his name, but he couldn't have changed his face.
You two are identical.
I bet they'll think you're him and even treat you like a king.
Know where the cloaks are from?
They belonged to the Puccia bandits.
That way, our dead will travel with you.
Come on.
Enough goodbyes!
Let's go!
Turn left.
When did your brother leave?
When Pietro was born.
-Why didn't we leave, too?
-Because.
What's your brother like?
What do you mean?
He's my spitting image.
We're twins.
How can we be sure we'll find him?
Of course we'll find him.
He looks exactly like me.
Your clothes!
Stop!
Stop!
Enough!
You bloody fool!
Hold this!
Look at you!
-You're sick.
-Shut up!
Pick up your things.
Are you planning to go to America in rags?
Your shoes!
-I've lost my shoes.
-Too bad.
You'll walk to America barefoot, you fool.
-No!
-Find them.
Where are they?
-I'm cursed.
-I've got them.
Pick them up!
Get going!
Get!
Come on!
Your clothes!
Fold them up properly.
We have to arrive looking like princes!
Here.
Don't get it dirty.
I'm cursed.
Come on!
-Look at that!
-What?
Come on!
-Hey, you!
-All the spirits are here!
They're angry with us.
They'll never let us leave!
Can't the spirits come with us?
They fear the sea.
They say thousands of evil souls fly above the sea.
So talk them round!
Damn me and my ancestors!
Do we have to stay here?
Are we going to die here?
A great life this is!
She thinks I'm afraid.
She thinks I'm afraid!
Let's stay, then.
Come out now.
Come on.
We have to go.
Mum, where are you going?
To look for you, wretch.
Your brother can't take anymore.
You left me here alone.
I want to see the new land, too.
-The poor thing, can he come?
-Mum!
I'm bringing him to you.
Come over here.
Come on.
Such grim looks!
Smile.
Smile.
Smile.
Smile.
Those who leave are seeds to be planted in more fertile land.
You're our future.
Embrace each other now.
Embrace each other as if you'll meet again soon.
That'll do.
Get ready.
God will guide you there.
Hurry up now.
Let's get going.
Salvatore, you see these two girls?
I'm entrusting them to you.
They have to arrive as they left.
-And how is that?
-As decent girls.
Come on!
Climb on, Pietro.
Come on!
Let's go!
Help me with the shoes!
This is so fresh it'll last until America!
We don't want it!
Salvatore, help me down!
Get your things.
Don't touch anything!
Pietro!
Where are you?
-Don't get lost!
-Come over here!
Stick together!
We don't want it.
Keep moving!
Give us a break!
Move!
Move it!
What the hell do you want?
-You're leaving for America?
-Yes.
-You have to come with me.
-Why didn't you say so?
Can you take us to the doctor?
-Yes.
-So take us there!
-Are you ill?
-We're going to America.
Any rashes?
Stomach ache?
Any itches?
Let me see your tongue.
Got any fleas?
Any itching?
Are you blind, deaf or mute?
How do you feel?
Got a fever?
He's not speaking.
Is he mute?
This one's mute!
No, there's no mute here.
-They repatriate the deaf mutes.
-What do they do?
-They send them home.
-Where?
I can sell you a cure I've invented.
It makes the dead talk.
That's rubbish!
I'm a healer.
I know about doctor things.
Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but this cure for mutes is something you have to buy.
Let me see if you have fleas.
Stick your tongue out.
Come on!
-Move on!
Move on!
-Get out of here!
-Where are you taking that?
-T o America.
-You have to pay.
-What?
-You have to pay for it.
-What?
-It only costs two cents.
-Two cents?
-Two cents.
-Why?
-Because it's for sale.
-What is it?
-Medicine for the teeth.
-For the teeth?
-He said it was for mutes!
-No, it's for teeth.
We don't need it, then.
Let's go.
Mancuso, four of us and these ladies who are getting married.
Do you have photos?
Can I see them?
-Your photos.
-We don't have them.
Carmelo, get photos done for these four!
Okay.
Follow me.
Watch where you're going.
Off you go.
Off you go.
Next.
Come on.
-Miss, are you together?
-Yes.
-How many are you?
-Mancuso.
Your name?
Mancuso...
-Your name?
-Mancuso, Salvatore.
Mancuso, Salvatore.
-You?
-Angelo.
Angelo.
You?
What's your name?
-What's his name?
-Mancuso, Pietro.
Mancuso, Pietro.
And you, madam, what's your name?
-Fortunata.
-Fortunata.
-And you, miss?
-Rita.
-Rita.
What's your name?
-Rosa.
-Rosa.
And you, miss?
-Lucy.
Luce.
You can go.
Off you go!
Excuse me, miss.
Miss!
You with the red hair!
-I'm talking to you.
Is she with you?
-No!
-Why are we still here?
Let's go.
-Hey, I'm talking to the lady.
Why?
Curious, huh?
Where are you off to?
Get lost!
Salvatore, what's she got to do with us?
Let's go.
Come on!
Whatever that medicine was, let's just get out of here.
Come on, Pietro.
Third class!
Show your tickets!
Stick together!
Stick together!
Come on, Pietro.
-Where are you going?
-Come back, you fool!
-Damn you!
-Stubborn idiot!
Stay with me, you blockhead!
Come on!
Come on!
Let us through!
No, not here.
Men here, women there.
All the women together, all the men together.
No pushing!
Stop pushing!
Salvatore!
Get out of my way!
-Get your hands off me!
-She's my mother!
Mancuso, there are four of us.
We're all Mancusos.
-Yes, yes.
Men here, women there.
-You stay with me.
Stay calm!
I have my whole family with me!
Excuse me, madam.
This is my bed.
-I'm here now.
-Look.
It's written here.
-I can't read.
-I'm sorry, madam.
-Dad!
-Get a bed, Pietro.
That's good.
Take that one.
Good, Pietro.
I'll go here.
Just below, Dad.
-Is your father comfortable?
-Yes.
He's an old man, you know.
-Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
-Spera, Calogero, from Realimici.
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry about it.
-Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
-Mangiapane, Giuseppe, from Carini.
-Esposito, Nicola, from Cinisi.
-Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
This is my son.
Esposito, Nicola, from Cinisi.
I've never slept with so many foreigners before.
Foreigners?
But we're not foreigners!
We're all Italian.
-Italian?
-Italian.
-We don't speak the same way.
-Don't you know you're Italian?
If you say so.
If you know so much, tell me something.
-When do we see Big Luciano?
-Who?
He means the big ocean, the Atlantic.
-That's right.
-In a week or so.
Can you help me, please?
Thank you.
-Why turn your dress inside out?
-What?
Why did you turn your dress inside out?
To keep it clean on the journey.
-What's your name?
-Rita.
-What's the garlic for?
-So I won't fall ill.
-Want some?
-No, thanks.
It stinks.
-What's your name?
-Angela.
God only knows how long we're going to be stuck here, and this is just the beginning.
I never thought I'd live to see this.
-I should have stayed at home.
-Madam.
Madam.
Could you lower your voice?
I have a headache.
Then have one!
What do I care?
Who does she think she is?
This is the last thing I needed.
A journey like this ahead, and she has a headache.
There's nothing here.
-Nothing at all.
-We're on the sea.
Come over here.
Wait.
Come here, Mum.
Sit down here.
Sit down.
Sit down.
They have such big, fine horses because their streets are long.
I hear they even have rivers of milk in California.
I can't swim, but I wouldn't mind a dip in a river of milk.
Sure, maybe there are even flying donkeys that scatter money.
You really believe that?
Hey, Caruso.
Take this to Miss Luce.
Tell her that it's from Mr. Mangiapane.
Give this to Rita from Giovanni.
Excuse me.
What are you up to with Luce?
Nothing.
And you?
-She looked at me.
-At me, too.
How could she look at you if she looked at me?
-She looked at me.
-You're making it up.
You can't be serious.
Anyone can have her.
-You just have to pay.
-Pay?
With all due respect, you shouldn't talk like that.
Miss Luce is traveling with me, and no one is to disrespect her.
Leave it at that.
Miss Luce.
Miss Luce.
-My father sent this.
-Thank you.
-Where's your mother?
-She's dead.
She died long ago.
The lady's not interested in all that.
-Aren't you married?
-No.
-Don't you want to marry?
-That's enough!
Shut up now.
Apparently, Miss Luce was married to a nobleman.
He was related to their king.
-He had a castle.
-She fell for an American.
She left her husband to go to America.
When she got there, her American didn't turn up.
-She couldn't get in alone.
-She's looking for a man now.
They say Luce was married to a prince, but he had so many wives he sent her to America.
She's all on her own now, and she needs a man to care for her.
-Perhaps she's a queen.
-How should I know?
The sleepwalker's back.
If you want my men's protection, you have to earn it.
Behave yourself like the rest of us.
My son's not right for you.
You're too foreign.
You need a man who can support you.
Look at your hands.
Why?
What's wrong with my hands?
Come here, Pietro!
Don't be scared.
Come with me.
You'll wake him!
Let go of me!
So where's America?
It's here, but you can't see it.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
You look younger without a mustache.
I'm still young, though.
Salvatore, would you marry me?
Who?
Me?
Of course.
Right away.
You're the one asking me?
I need a man to help me get in.
I'm here.
When can we get married?
When we reach the island, you'll have to call me out.
I'll call you right away.
I'm not scared.
I'm not marrying you for love.
Love?
We hardly know each other.
Those things take time.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right?
Yes.
Here's what we'll do.
Give me a lock of your hair.
Now we won't lose each other.
I don't believe in magic.
With time, I'll teach you.
-We don't have all day.
-Stay behind the line.
Stop there!
Stay behind the line!
Over there!
Over there!
Move along!
Put the bags down!
Put the bags down!
Take your hats off!
Lower your head.
What month is it?
What day is it?
What month is it?
What day is it?
I'd like to know.
What day is it?
Leave the cross there.
Do you understand me?
Why are you doing this?
Can't you answer?
-Your name?
-Mancuso, Salvatore.
-Where are you from?
-Petralia Sottana.
-How old are you?
-Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven.
-Pick up your bags!
-Was that so hard?
Pick up your bags!
In line!
In line!
Nice and neat.
I want neat lines above all.
Don't push.
In line!
Look down.
Look up.
Down.
Up.
Don't worry.
It's all right.
Look down.
Open your eyes.
Keep still.
We won't hurt you.
-Try not to move.
-Off you go.
Next.
Hat.
Lift your hands.
Lift your hands.
Spread your fingers.
Turn your hands around.
Open wide.
Stick your tongue out.
Come on.
Further.
Further.
To one side.
Further out.
Wider.
Stick your tongue out.
Further out.
Further out.
Have you been sick?
Can you speak?
Why don't you answer?
He's my son.
Can't you make him speak?
He's a stubborn one, but he works harder than a mule.
-Take your trousers off.
-Take your pants off.
Take them off.
Come on!
Come on!
-Leave your brother alone.
-What are you doing?
Pietro.
Pietro, don't be afraid.
Take them off.
He's still shaken from the journey, poor kid.
He'll do it now!
He'll do it now!
My son stays with...
Okay.
My son stays with me!
-Come back here.
-I'm telling you he's my son!
-We have to finish the examination.
-What examination?
Don't worry, Pietro.
-My son...
-Come.
Come.
Lie down, madam.
Lie down on your side, please.
Like this, with your head here.
What's she doing?
Get your hands off.
What are you doing?
-Calm down.
It's procedure.
-Get your hands off me!
I don't want anyone touching me!
Don't be afraid.
Take your time.
Think hard.
How many legs on a horse?
Four.
How many legs on a horse and how many on a hen?
Four and two.
Therefore?
-They walk.
-No.
How many legs in all?
How many legs on a pig, a hen and a goat?
All right.
All right.
This is the house.
You can dry things here or keep animals.
You can put them here.
You're out at sea in a small boat.
There's a big storm.
There are two sacks in the boat.
One is full of bread, and the other, full of gold.
Which do you throw overboard?
Why throw them overboard?
Get rid of the gold?
I can't throw gold away.
I eat the bread.
I don't throw anything overboard.
Is that right?
Is it right?
Let's try an exercise now.
I'll give you instructions, and you have to carry them out in order.
Open the door and put the chair near the door.
You have to do things in the order that I tell you.
First, you open the door, then you move the chair.
You got it wrong.
I asked you to open the door and then take the chair over to it.
Start again.
That's better.
Now open the door, put the chair near the door,
pick up the book and put it on the floor.
Miss Rita D'Agostino, stand up, please.
Do you acknowledge this man as your future husband?
Miss, look up a little, please.
Miss, do you acknowledge this man as your future husband?
Yes.
The wedding will be on the 1 7th at Ellis Island.
Please be seated.
Miss Rosa Napolitano, please stand up.
Miss, do you acknowledge this man as your future husband?
-How old are you?
-Thirty-five.
-How old?
-Thirty-five.
Liar!
Wretch!
I thought you were a lot younger and taller.
You're so short.
Anyone would think you were still sitting.
This is what I left my family for?
I already have a father at home.
I don't need another!
Ugly wretch!
Have you got money?
Do you acknowledge this man as your future husband?
Yes.
The wedding will be on the 1 7th at Ellis Island.
Please be seated.
Miss Dolores Torres, please stand up.
Mr. Sergio Dominguez.
Sergio Dominguez, I know you're here.
Why won't you show yourself?
How long will you leave me here?
I've been waiting for days now.
Mrs. Fortunata Mancuso.
Thank you.
Mrs. Fortunata Mancuso.
-Present.
-Please.
I'm fine sitting here.
What is that stuff?
All those stars and crosses?
Madam, do you think we wish to do you harm?
What do you want from us?
Who do you mean?
Everyone from the old world.
Madam, we want to know if you're fit enough to enter the new world.
And you think you're God?
Who are you to decide if we're fit or not to enter this new world of yours?
Madam, if you wish to enter the new world, you must accept its rules.
Sit here and take the exam, or we'll deport you.
We'll send you home.
Mr. Marcello Tarsitano, please.
What the hell is this glass?
It's frosted glass.
You can't see anything.
-Not a thing.
-You can see from up there.
We'd have to climb up.
-Shall we climb up?
-Let's do it.
What are those long things?
-They look like towers.
-Bell towers.
-Could they be houses?
-They're houses, 1 00 floors high!
How do you get up there?
There's a wooden box that carries people up and down, on its own.
-On its own?
-On its own.
-Can animals go up, too?
-Everything can go up.
-I wouldn't like to go home in a box.
-Me, neither.
-My house has to be on the ground.
-I'd like a house in the sky.
What are you doing?
Get down now!
-What do we do?
Pray, too?
-Our Father or Ave Maria?
Let's say them all.
"In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit..."
It's like eating a cloud.
God be praised.
Mr. Mancuso, have you filled out the form?
No.
Do you know this woman?
You bet I know her, and she knows me, too.
What is her name, please?
-Luce.
-Luce what?
-Luce Reed.
You always forget it.
-Luce Reed.
Please complete the form.
Here.
What's going on?
What do I do with this thing?
You don't want to marry me?
Of course I do, but you have to write it down.
I can't write.
I can't read, either.
Can't we get married anymore?
Mr. Salvatore Mancuso, please stand up.
Mr. Mancuso, do you acknowledge this woman as your future bride?
Of course.
Would I be here otherwise?
Yes.
The wedding will be at Ellis Island.
Date to be determined.
Do you have flowers for your fiancée?
I'll offer you this crown that flies.
Mr. Mancuso, step forward.
Mr. Mancuso, your son is mute and cannot be admitted.
Your mother is feeble-minded and cannot be admitted.
What will you do now, continue the admission process or return home?
But...
Excuse me.
I...
I don't mean to be disrespectful,
but I don't understand.
What's wrong?
How can they be a problem?
How are my mother and my son a problem with all the land and work you have here?
Because he doesn't speak?
It's for the best, you know.
This way, he won't bore anyone.
He'll never complain.
And, my mother, look at her.
She's like a young girl.
True, she talks a lot, but I'll keep her indoors and won't let her out.
We've come all this way only to be parted now?
Dad,
Grandma told me she wants to go home.
She also told me that we have to stay.
Come on!
Anybody here?
You scared me!
Who is he?
The deaf mute.
So what do you want?
Go on.
Go on.
Shall I tell her?
She's possessed.
She doesn't talk, sleep or eat anymore.
There's a curse on her.
She says a snake's twisting in her belly.
How did it get in there?
- Go on.
Tell her.
- Come over here.
- You heard her.
- Come here.
When did it start?
When Don Ercole promised us to two rich Americans.
- Look at these.
- I don't understand words on paper.
No, these aren't words.
They're real things.
Look.
Look at the onion!
Is that money on the tree?
It's the new land.
Burn them.
Don't be afraid.
So what do we do?
Shall we remove it?
- I can't take it anymore!
- Get rid of that thing!
It's over.
Calm down now.
We're here.
We've brought the stones.
We wanted to ask you something.
What should we do?
Should we leave, or should we stay here?
Give us a sign, just a sign.
We'll wait here.
We won't move.
Blessed be the Lord.
- Zapparelli.
- Zapparelli.
Hey, there.
Get that goat.
- Where is he?
- Inside.
He's inside?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Here are our animals.
Take a look at them.
Take a look.
This one's stronger than a mare, and it hasn't even been a month since it was born.
Beautiful, huh?
Look at this one.
- You're sure this time?
- More than ever.
And your mother?
If she wants to come, fine.
If not, I'll leave her with you.
We're leaving.
We'll get you some clothes.
Leave the animals here.
Come in.
Come on.
Have a seat.
Take that hat off.
Take that thing off!
Hands off!
Lift your foot.
These boots used to belong to Giovanni Gramigna, a scoundrel with a heart of gold.
- They seem good to me.
- They are good.
Lift your foot.
Look at these wooden soles.
You'll never wear them out.
Your foot.
These belonged to the Baron's son, who died as a child.
Take my advice.
Don't put them on until you get to town.
Of course.
You understand?
These are the Baron's boots.
This here
is for Salvatore.
This, on the other hand, is for Angelo.
As for this, it's for Pietro.
It was Bastianuzzo's.
May he rest in peace.
These are clothes for a prince.
- I can't send you to America in rags.
- God will reward you.
Put them on.
Let's see what you look like.
How will I find my brother there?
Your brother, maybe he's someone important now.
Maybe he's changed his name, but he couldn't have changed his face.
You two are identical.
I bet they'll think you're him and even treat you like a king.
Know where the cloaks are from?
They belonged to the Puccia bandits.
That way, our dead will travel with you.
Come on.
Enough goodbyes!
Let's go!
Turn left.
When did your brother leave?
When Pietro was born.
- Why didn't we leave, too?
- Because.
What's your brother like?
What do you mean?
He's my spitting image.
We're twins.
How can we be sure we'll find him?
Of course we'll find him.
He looks exactly like me.
Your clothes!
Stop!
Stop!
Enough!
You bloody fool!
Hold this!
Look at you!
- You're sick.
- Shut up!
Pick up your things.
Are you planning to go to America in rags?
Your shoes!
- I've lost my shoes.
- Too bad.
You'll walk to America barefoot, you fool.
- No!
- Find them.
Where are they?
- I'm cursed.
- I've got them.
Pick them up!
Get going!
Get!
Come on!
Your clothes!
Fold them up properly.
We have to arrive looking like princes!
Here.
Don't get it dirty.
I'm cursed.
Come on!
- Look at that!
- What?
Come on!
- Hey, you!
- All the spirits are here!
They're angry with us.
They'll never let us leave!
Can't the spirits come with us?
They fear the sea.
They say thousands of evil souls fly above the sea.
So talk them round!
Damn me and my ancestors!
Do we have to stay here?
Are we going to die here?
A great life this is!
She thinks I'm afraid.
She thinks I'm afraid!
Let's stay, then.
Come out now.
Come on.
We have to go.
Mum, where are you going?
To look for you, wretch.
Your brother can't take anymore.
You left me here alone.
I want to see the new land, too.
- The poor thing, can he come?
- Mum!
I'm bringing him to you.
Come over here.
Come on.
Such grim looks!
Smile.
Smile.
Smile.
Smile.
Those who leave are seeds to be planted in more fertile land.
You're our future.
Embrace each other now.
Embrace each other as if you'll meet again soon.
That'll do.
Get ready.
God will guide you there.
Hurry up now.
Let's get going.
Salvatore, you see these two girls?
I'm entrusting them to you.
They have to arrive as they left.
- And how is that?
- As decent girls.
Come on!
Climb on, Pietro.
Come on!
Let's go!
Help me with the shoes!
This is so fresh it'll last until America!
We don't want it!
Salvatore, help me down!
Get your things.
Don't touch anything!
Pietro!
Where are you?
- Don't get lost!
- Come over here!
Stick together!
We don't want it.
Keep moving!
Give us a break!
Move!
Move it!
What the hell do you want?
- You're leaving for America?
- Yes.
- You have to come with me.
- Why didn't you say so?
Can you take us to the doctor?
- Yes.
- So take us there!
- Are you ill?
- We're going to America.
Any rashes?
Stomach ache?
Any itches?
Let me see your tongue.
Got any fleas?
Any itching?
Are you blind, deaf or mute?
How do you feel?
Got a fever?
He's not speaking.
Is he mute?
This one's mute!
No, there's no mute here.
- They repatriate the deaf mutes.
- What do they do?
- They send them home.
- Where?
I can sell you a cure I've invented.
It makes the dead talk.
That's rubbish!
I'm a healer.
I know about doctor things.
Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but this cure for mutes is something you have to buy.
Let me see if you have fleas.
Stick your tongue out.
Come on!
- Move on!
Move on!
- Get out of here!
- Where are you taking that?
- To America.
- You have to pay.
- What?
- You have to pay for it.
- What?
- It only costs two cents.
- Two cents?
- Two cents.
- Why?
- Because it's for sale.
- What is it?
- Medicine for the teeth.
- For the teeth?
- He said it was for mutes!
- No, it's for teeth.
We don't need it, then.
Let's go.
Mancuso, four of us and these ladies who are getting married.
Do you have photos?
Can I see them?
- Your photos.
- We don't have them.
Carmelo, get photos done for these four!
Okay.
Follow me.
Watch where you're going.
Off you go.
Off you go.
Next.
Come on.
- Miss, are you together?
- Yes.
- How many are you?
- Mancuso.
Your name?
Mancuso...
- Your name?
- Mancuso, Salvatore.
Mancuso, Salvatore.
- You?
- Angelo.
Angelo.
You?
What's your name?
- What's his name?
- Mancuso, Pietro.
Mancuso, Pietro.
And you, madam, what's your name?
- Fortunata.
- Fortunata.
- And you, miss?
- Rita.
- Rita.
What's your name?
- Rosa.
- Rosa.
And you, miss?
- Lucy.
Luce.
You can go.
Off you go!
Excuse me, miss.
Miss!
You with the red hair!
- I'm talking to you.
Is she with you?
- No!
- Why are we still here?
Let's go.
- Hey, I'm talking to the lady.
Why?
Curious, huh?
Where are you off to?
Get lost!
Salvatore, what's she got to do with us?
Let's go.
Come on!
Whatever that medicine was, let's just get out of here.
Come on, Pietro.
Third class!
Show your tickets!
Stick together!
Stick together!
Come on, Pietro.
- Where are you going?
- Come back, you fool!
- Damn you!
- Stubborn idiot!
Stay with me, you blockhead!
Come on!
Come on!
Let us through!
No, not here.
Men here, women there.
All the women together, all the men together.
No pushing!
Stop pushing!
Salvatore!
Get out of my way!
- Get your hands off me!
- She's my mother!
Mancuso, there are four of us.
We're all Mancusos.
- Yes, yes.
Men here, women there.
- You stay with me.
Stay calm!
I have my whole family with me!
Excuse me, madam.
This is my bed.
- I'm here now.
- Look.
It's written here.
- I can't read.
- I'm sorry, madam.
- Dad!
- Get a bed, Pietro.
That's good.
Take that one.
Good, Pietro.
I'll go here.
Just below, Dad.
- Is your father comfortable?
- Yes.
He's an old man, you know.
- Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
- Spera, Calogero, from Realimici.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
- Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
- Mangiapane, Giuseppe, from Carini.
- Esposito, Nicola, from Cinisi.
- Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
This is my son.
Esposito, Nicola, from Cinisi.
I've never slept with so many foreigners before.
Foreigners?
But we're not foreigners!
We're all Italian.
- Italian?
- Italian.
- We don't speak the same way.
- Don't you know you're Italian?
If you say so.
If you know so much, tell me something.
- When do we see Big Luciano?
- Who?
He means the big ocean, the Atlantic.
- That's right.
- In a week or so.
Can you help me, please?
Thank you.
- Why turn your dress inside out?
- What?
Why did you turn your dress inside out?
To keep it clean on the journey.
- What's your name?
- Rita.
- What's the garlic for?
- So I won't fall ill.
- Want some?
- No, thanks.
It stinks.
- What's your name?
- Angela.
God only knows how long we're going to be stuck here, and this is just the beginning.
I never thought I'd live to see this.
- I should have stayed at home.
- Madam.
Madam.
Could you lower your voice?
I have a headache.
Then have one!
What do I care?
Who does she think she is?
This is the last thing I needed.
A journey like this ahead, and she has a headache.
There's nothing here.
- Nothing at all.
- We're on the sea.
Come over here.
Wait.
Come here, Mum.
Sit down here.
Sit down.
Sit down.
They have such big, fine horses because their streets are long.
I hear they even have rivers of milk in California.
I can't swim, but I wouldn't mind a dip in a river of milk.
Sure, maybe there are even flying donkeys that scatter money.
You really believe that?
Hey, Caruso.
Take this to Miss Luce.
Tell her that it's from Mr. Mangiapane.
Give this to Rita from Giovanni.
Excuse me.
What are you up to with Luce?
Nothing.
And you?
- She looked at me.
- At me, too.
How could she look at you if she looked at me?
- She looked at me.
- You're making it up.
You can't be serious.
Anyone can have her.
- You just have to pay.
- Pay?
With all due respect, you shouldn't talk like that.
Miss Luce is traveling with me, and no one is to disrespect her.
Leave it at that.
Miss Luce.
Miss Luce.
- My father sent this.
- Thank you.
- Where's your mother?
- She's dead.
She died long ago.
The lady's not interested in all that.
- Aren't you married?
- No.
- Don't you want to marry?
- That's enough!
Shut up now.
Apparently, Miss Luce was married to a nobleman.
He was related to their king.
- He had a castle.
- She fell for an American.
She left her husband to go to America.
When she got there, her American didn't turn up.
- She couldn't get in alone.
- She's looking for a man now.
They say Luce was married to a prince, but he had so many wives he sent her to America.
She's all on her own now, and she needs a man to care for her.
- Perhaps she's a queen.
- How should I know?
The sleepwalker's back.
If you want my men's protection, you have to earn it.
Behave yourself like the rest of us.
My son's not right for you.
You're too foreign.
You need a man who can support you.
Look at your hands.
Why?
What's wrong with my hands?
Come here, Pietro!
Don't be scared.
Come with me.
You'll wake him!
Let go of me!
So where's America?
It's here, but you can't see it.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
You look younger without a mustache.
I'm still young, though.
Salvatore, would you marry me?
Who?
Me?
Of course.
Right away.
You're the one asking me?
I need a man to help me get in.
I'm here.
When can we get married?
When we reach the island, you'll have to call me out.
I'll call you right away.
I'm not scared.
I'm not marrying you for love.
Love?
We hardly know each other.
Those things take time.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right?
Yes.
Here's what we'll do.
Give me a lock of your hair.
Now we won't lose each other.
I don't believe in magic.
With time, I'll teach you.
- We don't have all day.
- Stay behind the line.
Stop there!
Stay behind the line!
Over there!
Over there!
Move along!
Put the bags down!
Put the bags down!
Take your hats off!
Lower your head.
What month is it?
What day is it?
What month is it?
What day is it?
I'd like to know.
What day is it?
Leave the cross there.
Do you understand me?
Why are you doing this?
Can't you answer?
- Your name?
- Mancuso, Salvatore.
- Where are you from?
- Petralia Sottana.
- How old are you?
- Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven.
- Pick up your bags!
- Was that so hard?
Pick up your bags!
In line!
In line!
Nice and neat.
I want neat lines above all.
Don't push.
In line!
Look down.
Look up.
Down.
Up.
Don't worry.
It's all right.
Look down.
Open your eyes.
Keep still.
We won't hurt you.
- Try not to move.
- Off you go.
Next.
Hat.
Lift your hands.
Lift your hands.
Spread your fingers.
Turn your hands around.
Open wide.
Stick your tongue out.
Come on.
Further.
Further.
To one side.
Further out.
Wider.
Stick your tongue out.
Further out.
Further out.
Have you been sick?
Can you speak?
Why don't you answer?
He's my son.
Can't you make him speak?
He's a stubborn one, but he works harder than a mule.
- Take your trousers off.
- Take your pants off.
Take them off.
Come on!
Come on!
- Leave your brother alone.
- What are you doing?
Pietro.
Pietro, don't be afraid.
Take them off.
He's still shaken from the journey, poor kid.
He'll do it now!
He'll do it now!
My son stays with...
Okay.
My son stays with me!
- Come back here.
- I'm telling you he's my son!
- We have to finish the examination.
- What examination?
Don't worry, Pietro.
- My son...
- Come.
Come.
Lie down, madam.
Lie down on your side, please.
Like this, with your head here.
What's she doing?
Get your hands off.
What are you doing?
- Calm down.
It's procedure.
- Get your hands off me!
I don't want anyone touching me!
Don't be afraid.
Take your time.
Think hard.
How many legs on a horse?
Four.
How many legs on a horse and how many on a hen?
Four and two.
Therefore?
- They walk.
- No.
How many legs in all?
How many legs on a pig, a hen and a goat?
All right.
All right.
This is the house.
You can dry things here or keep animals.
You can put them here.
You're out at sea in a small boat.
There's a big storm.
There are two sacks in the boat.
One is full of bread, and the other, full of gold.
Which do you throw overboard?
Why throw them overboard?
Get rid of the gold?
I can't throw gold away.
I eat the bread.
I don't throw anything overboard.
Is that right?
Is it right?
Let's try an exercise now.
I'll give you instructions, and you have to carry them out in order.
Open the door and put the chair near the door.
You have to do things in the order that I tell you.
First, you open the door, then you move the chair.
You got it wrong.
I asked you to open the door and then take the chair over to it.
Start again.
That's better.
Now open the door, put the chair near the door,
pick up the book and put it on the floor.
Miss Rita D'Agostino, stand up, please.
Do you acknowledge this man as your future husband?
Miss, look up a little, please.
Miss, do you acknowledge this man as your future husband?
Yes.
The wedding will be on the 17th at Ellis Island.
Please be seated.
Miss Rosa Napolitano, please stand up.
Miss, do you acknowledge this man as your future husband?
- How old are you?
- Thirty-five.
- How old?
- Thirty-five.
Liar!
Wretch!
I thought you were a lot younger and taller.
You're so short.
Anyone would think you were still sitting.
This is what I left my family for?
I already have a father at home.
I don't need another!
Ugly wretch!
Have you got money?
Do you acknowledge this man as your future husband?
Yes.
The wedding will be on the 17th at Ellis Island.
Please be seated.
Miss Dolores Torres, please stand up.
Mr. Sergio Dominguez.
Sergio Dominguez, I know you're here.
Why won't you show yourself?
How long will you leave me here?
I've been waiting for days now.
Mrs. Fortunata Mancuso.
Thank you.
Mrs. Fortunata Mancuso.
- Present.
- Please.
I'm fine sitting here.
What is that stuff?
All those stars and crosses?
Madam, do you think we wish to do you harm?
What do you want from us?
Who do you mean?
Everyone from the old world.
Madam, we want to know if you're fit enough to enter the new world.
And you think you're God?
Who are you to decide if we're fit or not to enter this new world of yours?
Madam, if you wish to enter the new world, you must accept its rules.
Sit here and take the exam, or we'll deport you.
We'll send you home.
Mr. Marcello Tarsitano, please.
What the hell is this glass?
It's frosted glass.
You can't see anything.
- Not a thing.
- You can see from up there.
We'd have to climb up.
- Shall we climb up?
- Let's do it.
What are those long things?
- They look like towers.
- Bell towers.
- Could they be houses?
- They're houses, 100 floors high!
How do you get up there?
There's a wooden box that carries people up and down, on its own.
- On its own?
- On its own.
- Can animals go up, too?
- Everything can go up.
- I wouldn't like to go home in a box.
- Me, neither.
- My house has to be on the ground.
- I'd like a house in the sky.
What are you doing?
Get down now!
- What do we do?
Pray, too?
- Our Father or Ave Maria?
Let's say them all.
"In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit..."
It's like eating a cloud.
God be praised.
Mr. Mancuso, have you filled out the form?
No.
Do you know this woman?
You bet I know her, and she knows me, too.
What is her name, please?
- Luce.
- Luce what?
- Luce Reed.
You always forget it.
- Luce Reed.
Please complete the form.
Here.
What's going on?
What do I do with this thing?
You don't want to marry me?
Of course I do, but you have to write it down.
I can't write.
I can't read, either.
Can't we get married anymore?
Mr. Salvatore Mancuso, please stand up.
Mr. Mancuso, do you acknowledge this woman as your future bride?
Of course.
Would I be here otherwise?
Yes.
The wedding will be at Ellis Island.
Date to be determined.
Do you have flowers for your fiancée?
I'll offer you this crown that flies.
Mr. Mancuso, step forward.
Mr. Mancuso, your son is mute and cannot be admitted.
Your mother is feeble-minded and cannot be admitted.
What will you do now, continue the admission process or return home?
But...
Excuse me.
I...
I don't mean to be disrespectful,
but I don't understand.
What's wrong?
How can they be a problem?
How are my mother and my son a problem with all the land and work you have here?
Because he doesn't speak?
It's for the best, you know.
This way, he won't bore anyone.
He'll never complain.
And, my mother, look at her.
She's like a young girl.
True, she talks a lot, but I'll keep her indoors and won't let her out.
We've come all this way only to be parted now?
Dad,
Grandma told me she wants to go home.
She also told me that we have to stay.

Hey, Rocco!
.
Bortolotti lord honoured us it, that came here, he wants to know.
And there was need for the helicopter?
.
They frightened the sheep and the goats.
Try to be more civilized, okay?
.
Bortolotti lord from afar went kindly here, how he should negotiate with you about the price of the land.
He came unnecessarily then.
Not selling neither my house, neither my land.
Indeed, I want nobody on my possession to see, helicopters mainly no.
I understand it if I am not nice for you, Mr. Ventura.
But would make it well if it would accept it my offer, before the bank reserves your lands.
- I know it well, you have enormous debts.
- Calm down, I solve my problems.
And would be good if the mayor not would rumour the inhabitants' private matters.
I was act just in the interest of you and for Calidonia.
Here a big tourist centre will be being built.
Yes, I heard it about already.
And now please, let them leave!
I tested it as a friend to behave with you, Mr. Ventura, but shows so, you like the frays.
- I think, you regret this yet.
- Good bye!
All right.
Let go!
You do not have to be worried.
The eagles stay here.
He got into order totally.
We managed to overcome the cancer.
But it may occur that he breaks out anew.
- I don't understand.
- The illness may recur.
- It that is it possible?
.
Something badly made?
.
- Not at all, Ma'am.
But all organisations respond some other way.
And for Roberto has sicknesses always yet.
and his hand trembles.
I am worried though because of the fervid headache.
We have to make changes in the therapy.
He gets an implement against an epilepsy.
But yet only eleven year age.
And already he went through a chemotherapy.
- Exactly.
We have to change it.
Take it away somewhere.
He needs fresh air, and onto much relaxation.
- And the school?
.
- The school would excite it only now.
No stress, nothing fervid emotion, no exertion.
Exclusively harmony.
And let him be a lot with his family.
Do you understand?
.
So Umberto Bortolotti guided tourist company from the realization of the Calidonia projekt taken a decision
- and we have to help them.
- How we shall help?
.
With the modification of the sorting plan, what possible one does, that Bortolotti lord take advantage of it the union supports.
We elected it already the sorting plan.
We modify it then now?
.
We modify a little of trifles.
Ladies and gentlemen!
You understand it, that where the Eagle gable may develop?
.
Real tourist paradise will be.
Restaurant, hotel, ski slope and ski lift.
- Well how the people would arrive there?
.
- But we solved the main problem already?
.
- What problem?
.
- The land, from where the elevator leaves is own of Rocco Ventura.
- He has the house, the economy there.
- I know, sells it nicely then.
This from what you think so?
.
That land since centuries is Ventura parentage, and you know,
- how important for him.
- Was not disappearing so, when he left to try one's luck.
- The situation is totally other now though.
- Really?
.
Now it's too late.
Let us speak openly.
Rocco got into debt totally, and Bortolotti lord made a promising offer for him.
Above price buys his land from him.
Has to accept this in the interest of Calidonia.
- But Calidonia is famous for his cheese, isn't it?
.
- Come on.
The young persons go away from here.
Already nobody does not made a cheese.
You have truth.
Atlas!
Greet for a dad, next let us go to rest.
Roberto, your head catches cold!
You left your cap here.
Daddy!
- Nino,the dad is in the office?
.
- He is above on the terrace.
Unfortunately a lot my occupied room, a Japanese group arrives soon.
- And there is not an other solution?
.
- Daddy!
Hi, Daddy!
Go to the mum, I am busy now.
Excuse me!
.
Yes.
I have a room, which is very beautiful, and with nothing not worse at the others.
Indeed, I would recommend it.
Rocco!
Rocco Ventura!
Stop!
Where is my son?
- Calm down!
At me, at home.
- No, no I calm down.
What he is occupied with the goats?
Marco has to be with us, within in the shop.
There his place.
Good.
I do not force it, that let him be with the goats.
- Marco does what he wants.
- What you know about it, what my son wants?
- You take advantage of it, because he deaf-mute!
- Antonietta, inside your son like that opportunities are hiding, which you cannot imagine.
Good bye!
That your trouble, that for our son has to wear a cap always.
- Because you are ashamed of it him.
- That me?
What you say?
Since they performed an operation on it, onto him you are watching.
Your work is pretension only.
Not pretension.
Is not really a free moment of mine.
You did not have free moment once.
But you were here.
Now i'm here, only not I let him to turn my life upside down
- Roberto's illness.
- He would not be harmful to you.
He needs you.
He needs us.
You are not to understand it this?
.
Tell it then,what I should make?
What should I?
Let us leave the work at that.
The hotel, the tasks.
Let us leave everything at that.
Let us deal with Roberto only.
You exaggerate the things.
Roberta heals, no?
It is needed only, that again let him live a normal life.
Everything comes undone next.
Be watching already in the direction of the reality!
Not plain one how you believe it.
There is the opportunity of the decline.
Our son onto a calm place he has need where he may be recovering.
Onto fresh air and much relaxation.
May not go even to a school, don't you see?
Honey, I am afraid so much!
- So fragile.
- Calm down, Júlia!
- Calm down!
- I cannot calm down, not now!
Spiderman for Batman.
Do you see me?
The strength is not unfortunately with me today.
I may not go out.
- And if I would take it away to Calidonia?
- you never wanted to go there!
The situation is other now.
Your older brother's house is there, no?
.
Is doing emptily. let us take it away there!
Yes.
This is good idea.
Leave you!
You said it, that "leave you"?
And you?
Look, Julia.
Seventy Japanese tourists get into the hostel soon.
You understand, which I say?
You already have understand?
O my God!
Tiny, honey!
Oh, tiny!
Calm down, honey!
We talked with a dad only.
Some we decided, that we travel away somewhere.
Right, Ferdinando?
And that fortune, that Bortolotti lord stands us by the renowned entrepreneur, and her knows it punctually, that...
Excuse me!
- Hello?
.
- I am Ferdinando.
Ferdinando, how are you?
Do not be angry if I disturb you, but I would like to ask you for something.
- Fresh one and delicate one for Cietta my aunt.
- Rocco!
Really should not have been.
I don't so much
You're a lot more to get me my aunt
Do not forget it, that your merit, that I can made a cheese like this.
Not my merit.
Your grandfather was teaching.
Me and my husband.
Was repeating it always, that two things are needed for him...
The fresh flavour of the mountains and a little love.
But the love does not enough for making of the cheese somebody else is needed for him.
You are young.
Let your heart to heal.
I regard you as so lonely always.
You are alone with your pain.
Establish a family.
Look for a girl for yourself, and marry it.
Give a kiss.
The assembly voted, and only four were blackball.
Do not place it upon each other.
The cheese needs air.
Yet that air!
If you do not make a step, the mayor and the Milan entrepreneur swallow you.
I do not sell my land.
There is mortgage on your house and your land.
You will be obliged to sell.
- I do everything.
- It does not enough
Not enough.
Come here!
I am in an Internet contact with this with the French firm.
Daddy, turn it down!
- With traditional foods they trade in similar ones.
- Good, and?
- They would distribute your cheese with pleasure.
- Really?
- Yes.
But you have to struggle along: a thousand aspromonte cheese is asked under three months, and two thousand under a year.
And after all how?
A thousand cheeses under three months?
Bring workers, the co-operative helps then.
- I need nobody.
- Rocco!
It is little if you sell the cheese at the neighbourhood.
Onto the survival this only real chance of yours.
Don't you see?
Lone wolf!
- Let me not hand over the money your cheese?
.
- Whoo, really.
Why you do not want to enter into the co-operative?
If would succeed finally to protect the product, the calabria cheese the whole world would recognise it.
I am finished with the co-operatives.
With the associations.
You too do you know why.
Because I am in my own way I make cheese
I will not listen to others.
Well made it then so the cheese!
Wooden-headed calabria...
I do not want you to go away.
But your mommy does not want you to be here.
That why?
What you want to do how since you did not relate it.
You like taking care of the animals, the plants, the lands.
You have to tell it to your mother then.
She'll understand.
I deal with him then.
Send something, okay?
- Dr. Valentin!
I may talk to you?
.
- Of course, say it!
Mayor lord!
What will he be with the tourist centre?
We modify it the sorting one plan, the case is in a straight.
What doe that mean?
That Rocco sold his land?
Well, Rocco did not sell it yet, but will sell it.
- Did I talk about my nephew, on who they performed an operation, to you already?
- No.
Of course, how I continue the work, I brought the computer.
- When we get there, mommy?
.
- Immediately, honey, be with patience!
- You with who you are?
.
- Only my son.
I want to send it into a press the substance.
You know, the novel has a big success in America.
- Yes, i know.
- Oh it doesn't matter.
Send the translation only as soon as you know it.
-And try to have fun a little bit!
- Would be good.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Well here what happened?
.
And now what we shall do?
.
- There is an other road out sure.
- We test it that road.
Look over there, a cowboy!
Let us ask it from him.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Excuse me, onto this Calidonia is?
.
- Not, it is necessary to go back onto the main road.
We're going into Santa Dominica.
You know, where the mayor's house is?
.
Sure, adjacent my possession.
Then longer on this road.
- The house onto 1 kilometre is from here.
- Thank you.
This way!
Robertino!
Robertino, my honey!
How are you?
- Hi!
- Welcome, ma'am!
- Julia,darling!
What joy, that you are here.
- For us yeah.
- Filomena, go, and bring it in the packets!
- Leave it, I arrange it then.
Not at all.
Yet that you?
.
Filomena she is here in order that she helps.
- Thank you, Filomena.
- Young man, that you grew up!
Imagine, we saw a rider, who has sheeps.
Do not care about him.
Come on, here the doctor lord.
- Here doctors are waiting?
.
- Don't worry, my saint!
Here he is.
He is Giorgio Valenti.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Ma'am.
My sister-in-law and my dear nephew, Roberto.
We arranged everything out here, within.
There is not too good weather unfortunately today.
Robertino, I have a surprise for you.
A walkie-talkie!
You may reach it if your mommy takes a walk
- I will be calmer so.
- Why not you try it promptly?
.
Come on, go!
- But great!
- Roberto, do not go far.
- You understand?
.
- Yes, mom.
Julia, do not play the worrying mother!
He be under cover, nothing may happen to him.
It is necessary to spare it from all exertions, and pay attention to him always!
- Good bye!
- Bye, doctor lord!
- Mayor lord.
- Dear doctor lord.
- Filomena, bring coffee to us!
- Now where did he go?
Roberto!
Wait, we find it immediately.
What I would have brought these to here otherwise?
Roberto Spadafore!
Roberto Spadafore, here is mayor.
- Here is Roberto.
- Where are you, Roberto?
- In forest.
- do not go far,
Good, I understand.
See, we are ready.
I have to go in into the office, we drink the coffee only.
Tell me, what's up in Reggio?
.
It's okay?
- Rocco Ventura?
.
- Yes, I am.
Hi, my name is Zagar.
I came from the service of medical officer in order to check the rooms.
Give it to me!
Wait a second, immediately.
How I shall check European Union's hygiene regulations.
- Good, yes, i see.
- Well, all right.
- I could look at the cheese dairy then?
- Everything regular.
Anti bacterial detergents, glove, shoe covers.
I see, but I could see it personally?
Of course.
So, is disappearing so sometimes, as if not you would take note of Roberto's state.
Like that, as if you would have remorse because of it.
And you do not want to take note of the trouble.
But the problem exists.
Very much.
The women torment themselves with the remorse and the psychology always.
I do not protect my sibling, but on him a hostel's responsibility lies.
- And Roberto?
Is our son not important already?
- Julia, you are a superb woman.
I know it well.
But you know, in the marriage there is need for patience and onto understanding.
The many Japanese tourists arrive soon.
He said that he comes after you as soon as he can.
You have to understand him.
You notice it, comes.
You know that he does not endure without you and without your son.
I gotta go, they are waiting already in the office.
I am at your service if anything is needed.
- Thank you.
- Please.
Filomena!
- Call me, if necessary.
- All right, mayor lord, be calm!
- I welcome Roberto.
- Hi, Angelo!
Rustic environment.
Can be made from recycled substances containers.
Cheese making technique with the superposition of stones.
The cooler onto a glance at least fifty year ones.
- Not regular?
- No, maybe the only regular thing here.
But already outdated.
Hey, Ventura!
Do you mix the cheese mass with this stick?
- Sure.
As it is my father and my grandfather too did it.
- But this is made of tree!
You are aware of him, that this difficultly can be cleaned and not hygienic?
This is very serious really.
That let us not talk about the others.
The baskets should be made of plastic, for this here though from steel.
All right, we look at this cave.
Write the minutes.
Sheep cheese.
Sick.
Even badder.
He is a magician, so.
- And I ripen it in this room the cheeses.
- Yes, i can see it.
I see it unfortunately.
And exactly until how much time the cheese ripens here?
At least a week, at most three months
What he did not sterilize certainly screwed the cheese into leaves.
Rough, walls which can be cleaned difficultly, i mean increasingly badder the situation.
Well this?
Mouses.
- That's impossible.
- Note it.
Bottles left open
Congratulations, Ventura lord!
Next puts it on the cheese nicely.
This place is dirty.
Ventura lord, you do not insure the proper hygiene.
Dirty?
.
The mildew is natural.
It the cheese will be characteristic, since centuries.
You heard Bizbilio and the Saracen ones' legend already?
.
This legend was about an become invincible shepherd and a goat.
Roberto!
Roberto
- I knew that there is somebody here.
- Roberto, where are you?
Yet that mice!
Roberto, where are you?
- Stop, little boy!
Where you run?
.
- Roberto, answer me!
- Not you hear me?
Stop!
- Roberto, you would answer?
Roberto, can you hear me?
Roberto, answer me!
- Roberto, answer already!
- Stop!
- Roberto, where are you?
.
- Stop!
Roberto, betray it, where are you!
Stop!
- Stop!
- Honey, answer me!
- Where are you, Roberto?
.
- I know, that dangerous, i know!
Honey!
Roberto, please!
Answer me!
Don't move!
And now be breathing deeply, okay?
.
Clever.
- Roberto!
- Answer me!
- Mom!
- Roberto, where are you?
I am it here in a forest.
Don't worry because of me!
I go immediately.
- Roberto, come home promptly!
- I finish it because I have to go now.
- Roberto!
Roberto!
- If kill, I have you imprisoned!
- Really?
-But if you die, how you can imprisoned me?
- Then my mommy
And my daddy and my uncle, he here the mayor.
The situation is increasingly better.
Come, stand up!
- You can walk?
.
- No.
- No?
.
Good, I carry you then
Come on!
My leg!
My foot hurts!
Put down, I can walk.
Mrs. Julia!
Mrs. Julia, they come there!
- Put down!
- Roberto!
Robert no!
My treasure, my costliness, what happened to you?
- But well what happened, what did you do to him?
- Nothing.
He fell over in forest.
- Filomena, please, let him carry him in!
- Immediately
- You would explain what happened?
.
- Keep it at a distance from the forest.
- There are fox traps everywhere.
- Fox traps?
How?
You know, I keep the people at a distance so.
You're crazy, irresponsible!
Pay attention to your son.
Keep it at a distance my land, and it'll be fine.
- I prepare cocoa for you.
- Oh, my God, where are we?
Between barbarians?
- What is the name of this man?
- Rocco Ventura.
- Rocco Ventura.
- Watch out, stair!
I talk to my brother-in-law tomorrow, and we arrange it.
- So?
.
- Á, Ventura úr!
I convey a list, what offends it here Europe Union's regulations.
There it is.
You make order, or you have to close it.
Shall we go!
Coming here was a mistake possibly.
- The last two are details.
- Even so it covers the assessed instalment.
And two weeks later going the next detail.
Together with the aggregating interests you with 150 thousand euros owe.
Ventura úr, the bank may launch bankruptcy proceedings against you, and may initiate the selling of your lands.
I need time only.
I received an order three thousand onto aspromonte cheese
- And what it solves?
- A thousand this year, two thousand next year, and I will be solvent.
I cheer you and your cheese on, but the bank wants money.
Not promises.
I know, thank you.
So, how you decided?
I tackle it it for a thousand pieces.
These three months will be hard, but I may calm down at least.
- I am glad about this very much.
- The controller causes the problem.
Well strike a compromise!
Make what he says.
I do not want to ruin the cheese, dared because of that the caves do not suit the union one for regulations.
- Well change it!
We arrange that our cheese should be like that somehow next, than a protected kind, which there is disappearing,
- I mean than me.
- Yes.
- Like that your laugh, than your father's.
- This remained at least.
No, no this only.
At this a lot more.
It's possible, but I realised it too late.
He caused us problem exclusively since Rocco Ventura came back.
I speak to him to gather up the traps before we throw it out from here.
All right.
I hope that you succeed.
Here you go.
- This like that, than a cartoon.
- You like that?
This new is tourist centre of Calidonia.
The elevator leaves from the Eagle gable, and it will have the terminal where you are: in Santa Dominica.
- Where that cheesy man lives?
- Yes.
However he will not be already there.
- But why?
.
- Well...
A child may not understand this.
Shall we go!
You need to rest.
Be allowed to lie already.
- Good day!
- Good day!
You have to gather up the traps.
My nephew's foot broke almost.
They withdrew my permit almost because of the child.
Speak to him in order for with him not to swarm around me.
Gather up the traps, I denounce you otherwise!
- Denounce!
- Do not be worried only, I do it.
But I would like to give an advice if I am here already.
Let me guess!
"Rocco, accept Bortolotti's offer, a property beautiful little sum.
You could live on its interests in your whole life."
- So boring.
- Yet better, than to go bankrupt with this many debts.
And with Calidonia you would do good.
The village has the right for the development.
You said the same one, when the dam you had it built up.
And then what happened?
I remind you then.
The building of the dam was interrupted because there was not water its operating.
And your Bortolotti lord he may have put a lot of union money in his pocket.
And now this tourist centre.
So be it.
But do not ask me to give up everything because the cheese of Calidonia is reports the future of village.
Let these goats already, Rocco!
No you see that the development is increasingly faster?
Look ahead.
But if I see you ahead, my mood arises rather yet to turn back.
You want a hard game?
.
That way I am capable though!
You know what say?
.
Take the development somewhere.
- But omit my land from him!
- Be left already.
- you know that controller?
What's his name?
Zagari.
- No.
- Get to know it then.
I have a speech with him.
- All right.
- You visit us then?
- Honey, i told you.
I do everything, I go as soon as I can.
Do, what you want.
I do not ask you for him much.
I come promptly.
All right yes.
I have to put it down now, because guests arrived.
Yes, go only to your guests...
The insecurity was left only already for him.
Truth felt it within because of the solitude fear... and the resignation, that has to fight alone longer.
You are telling me?
Spiderman in action again.
Roberto, do not go far!
The doctor said
- that you should not tire yourself
- Roger that.
Pay attention to the dangers especially.
- Do not go close that man's house!
- Roger that.
The mysterious man's house only a few steps yes.
Spiderman approaches silently towards it.
To strike down ready.
Push, come on!
All right, take it easy.
everything will be OK
That's clever.
Good girl.
That's clever.
Why is crying poor?
- You are here again?
.
- Is he badly?
He is not badly.
- It is not allowed to hurt the animals.
- All right.
That's clever.
- It is not allowed to hurt the animals.
- Stay silent already.
- This isn't right.
- Don't be afraid, I do not hurt it.
- I help him.
- But why cry?
- Because he gives birth just.
- A little goat?
Yes.
- Come here, and help me!
- Me?
You see somebody else here?
Come, keep his head!
All right, Marguerite.
That's clever.
Immediately is born.
Clever, all right.
That's clever.
Push!
Push!
Come on!
- Good girl.
- That's clever.
Clever.
Push, is outside immediately!
- Oh yeah!
Come on, push!
- Is ready immediately, come on!
He was born!
Wow, how large an!
Because only 1 is.
- What's he doing now?
- She is made to wash.
Look, how smart!
How cute.
- You want to catch it?
- Yes.
You know, his mum allows us to take it in a hand.
- We catch it then.
- Right, Marguerite?
Here you go.
I do not manage to do this.
Here you go, do it!
All right, you are smart.
You come now!
Wash it well.
- Why you cover your head?
.
- Because of the scar.
Dry yourself.
Are you ashamed of a scar?
You knew that when the old fighters went into a battle, they were placed in the first row the scar of who more were.
- Really?
.
- Sure.
Because the enemy got frightened of them much better.
The scar meant that they had been to many battles already,
- but nobody was able to overcome them yet.
- I did not know this.
Well you know it already now.
Oh, what now?
Run home!
I am busy.
Good evening, young man!
If yet two minutes you would have been late, I would have called the police.
- Your hand?
.
- Already...
I washed it.
Roberto, what's your problem?
How do you feel, honey?
- Since you have a fever!
- Not, I do not have a fever.
I ran only, and now i'm tired.
You ran in your state?
.
I could find it out, where have you been?
- I was walking only on the neighbourhood.
- You may not go away longer if this will be.
Look, that sweat.
And where you put your cap?
I do not put on the cap longer.
Not I have to be ashamed of my scar.
- And you and the Daddy do not need him to be ashamed.
- You what are you talking about?
The cap is needed because of that, that protect from the Sun.
- Good, you are not feverish.
- I told you.
Leave me alone, okay?
.
I am better already.
What's up with you, Roberto?
I do not want you to deal with me so, than with a child.
I am fighter!
- I am fighter!
- Roberto!
Summing everything up then:
this cheese dangerous or no?
Well, everything relative.
The raw milk, the rennet and pastures... none regular.
Well, then dangerous or no?
Being infectious between given circumstances may come into existence, intestinal infection may take shape even in a serious case.
They may be dead if this ensues.
Only in two-three of the percentages of the cases.
If spreads onto the man.
Protective measures introduced by Rocco Ventura however apposites.
- Dr. Zagari!
You have a child?
- Yes, a 20 years old daughter.
Imagine that you discover that the brakes were used up already on the car, with which your daughter is about to travel.
Although everything works.
But, there is two-three percent of chance, that the brakes go wrong suddenly, and your daughter dies in the accident unfortunately.
Tell, you would be able to live with the remorse that you did not take that two-three percent of chance?
You said nothing to your mum?
She has the right to can.
I know that it is necessary to made a thousand pieces under three months well.
Do not change a topic.
Do it if you want to be a vet.
The fact that you are deaf-mute means nothing.
You have to pass the exam!
The animals hear you, they do not need the speech.
- Well you are so stubborn?
.
- I want to look the goat.
Your mum does not want you to come here.
I want to look the goat!
I want to look at it, show me!
Learn it, how it is necessary to ask something.
Do not make demands.
- So what why I should show you?
.
- Because i... because I am ill.
The doctor said that I should not excite myself, and if somebody infuriates, I may die even then.
I see now.
Well then... work up!
What should I do?
Be cleaning up.
Gather up the cones and your fury is over.
This what?
Tree?
Rocco, come here, i don't understand, he what wants.
Work... form... this cheese...
goat... the milk... delicate...
Rocco.
Enough, run home!
You do not have to be worried.
Yet some days, and I finish it.
But do not forget it, I want to be passion in him.
I do not want you to translate it mechanically, okay?
Why, you saw that I did it so already?
No.
You are the most passionate man, who I know only.
I am worried about you a little bit only.
Locked away from the external world so...
Sometimes easier to pull out the passion if it is missing.
Do you think of your husband?
You know, what hurts the best?
Ferdinando is missing better when he is beside me.
- And that legend?
- Which legend?
What you told that man.
- The one that is about the Saracen ones?
- Yes.
The Saracen ones occupied Calabria before with many years.
All of them were very brave, but terribly fierce.
- Cruel?
.
- Exactly
The Saracen ones occupied the village, and only a little shepherd rose up.
- Was his name:
Bizbilio.
But the Saracen ones captured it him.
- And what was made with him?
- Well, he was thrown down into a dark and deep pitfall.
- And is he dead?
He was dying already.
But next...
a goat was spent on it, and gave milk to him and Bizbilio escaped, and healed.
- And?
.
- Even more goats ate repeatedly from it next, and Bizbilio drained their milk.
But there were too much, was not able to drink all of them.
So that put it aside.
And in the cave from the milk a cheese was slowly.
Than the kind you make?
He held all of the cheeses then, and took it into the village secretly.
The villagers ate it, and they were so strong from him, that the Saracen ones were able to be overcome,and they were sent home nicely.
No.
You know, I tasted it already, but did not taste good.
That's true, but you tasted his outside only.
Eat his inside now.
- This is very delicate!
- Outside tart, but inside sweet
- What did he say now?
- Like that, than some men, who from outside they may appear bad, but if you know them, and you see into their heart, you find out the goodness.
Then like that, just like you.
Oh, enough already now.
We have many things, work up!
May I look at the goat now?
- Go ahead!
- Thank you.
Bizbilio!
Stop it!
You do not hear it, Bizbilio?
Enough, this tickle me!
- Bizbilio?
- I named it so, you like that?
- Yes.
I would like to learn it, how you made the cheese.
- It is not easy.
- You said it, making automatically in the cave.
It was a legend only, and this work.
Oh, I ask you nicely!
I fell in love with it here so into everything.
- Really?
- I would like to be left for eternal one here, and to do it, that you.
Then it will be the best one if you try it.
You change your mind then.
- Thank you, Spiderman.
- Come back tomorrow, but without your camera.
And ask for your mommy's permission to leave, all right?
"A did not suspect it being immersed in his thoughts altogether, that something holder is approaching, and causes a huge surprise for him."
Hi, Mom, hi Filomena!
Where you were?
.
And how you look?
- You did not go away to that man?
- I'm hungry, we the dinner?
- I may test it?
.
- Be waiting yet.
Here you go.
Clever!
You study very quickly.
- How do you know, when it is ready?
- It is necessary to listen to it carefully.
The milk sings for us.
All right, enough already now.
- We look at it?
.
- Come on!
This is yours here.
One more?
.
Let nothing be wasted.
Így ni.
Yeah.
Oh, look at that!
And now you there, i here.
Push!
Big strength is needed for this.
You do it very skillfully.
Yeah.
You understood it immediately, what it is necessary to do.
Good morning, Roberto!
Are you awake?
- Come back tomorrow, but without your camera.
Like this, and now take it in one of your hands, yeah.
- Put it on!
- like this?
Yeah, that's clever.
- Roberto!
- Mom!
You have dress up an apron if you want to come in.
- I do not want to go in, we're goin home.
- No, no want!
Come here promptly.
Get your hands on my son!
- Make what your mommy says!
- Rather then i tell you, what he should make.
And stay away from him!
Let's go!
We're set, isn't it?
I wake up, and you you are not in your bed.
I see it next, that it it you are at unknown.
- He not unknown.
Roccónak hívják, a barátom.
Együtt készítünk sajtot.
His named Rocco, my friend.
We made cheese together.
Cheese?
You were tired one like that, even a morning because of this.
So he deals with this.
And if you would have been badly?
Some, that you faint yet?
Roberto!
You must not strain yourself.
The doctor also told You are weak yet.
I am not it.
You don't know, that from that cheese I will be invincible?
.
Did that mad man say this to you?
You do not see that he want take in you?
I can't believe it, he my friend.
Why would he want take in me?
I tell it, that why.
Dared is falling.
Your uncle wants to send it, and her tries to win you over to his own side.
This ethical blackmail, got it?
But henceforth only with me or with Filomena you may be going only away.
I go with you nowhere.
You are bad and liar.
Rocco onto many stunning things taught.
You you can say it only, what forbidden.
Roberto!
Roberto!
Here you go, take it!
I gave a relaxing tablets to him.
- He is very badly, right?
- Not, no.
That strange one, that physically all right, indeed great.
All upshot is in improving.
- There is only a trouble already.
- What?
He is stressful.
And this may cause problems yet really.
He started making a cheese, sure, that stressful.
It is tiredness.
The stress it somebody else.
You prohibited it if I took it well that he let go to Mr. Ventura.
- Yes.
- He would be better if he would intervene to it possibly.
But has to rest according to you, and according to Mastroienni professor.
Well just yeah.
Maybe without our will we cause the stress.
With the excessive attention.
Roberto he reached a fantastic improvement.
Well let us encourage it!
The enthusiasm the best one is medicine.
Have a nice day!
Thank you, doctor lord.
Bizbilio!
Bizbilio, wait!
I help then.
I am there already.
I am going already.
Bizbilio!
- Mr. Ventura!
- Yes?
Mr. Ventura!
I understand that you are angry at me because we stand on a contrary side.
- My brother-in-law would like your land, and...
- And I do not sell it.
What's the problem?
The problem is my small son.
Roberto had cancer, right?
Yes, his brain tumour.
They performed an operation on it.
They removed it totally.
But there is its danger, that may break out anew.
I do not take advantage of him if you think of this.
Asked me, how he should be allowed to help, and I accepted it.
Tell the truth, detains in the work and this in a present moment i can't allow it.
Yes, i understand, and i'm sorry!
Tell me, what should I do, and i'll do it.
I don't know.
Would you come onto a dinner?
We could talk it over with Roberto.
He got angry at me a little bit.
So?
- I go over with pleasure.
- Thank you.
- Whoo, Ma'am!
- Yes?
- When?
.
- But I am stupid.
Tonight.
Tonight be good?
Good.
"His last fear dispersed on the hilltop.
The girl laughed.
Unexpectedly and passionately, it appeared on sky one second moon."
He will not believe this certainly.
What is it, you finished the translation?
This is superb news!
Then immediately organize a meeting with the author, OK?
- I mean I should go into Reggio?
- Why, causes a problem possibly?
Not, only that situation, that Roberto he feels very well here.
Come alone.
Only one day.
Like this possibly even your husband...
- I don't know...
- I wait for you then.
You have truth possibly.
It will be good here.
Or rather here.
Mom, tell me, what that surprise!
Patience, and you notice it.
- Roberto, open door!
- Good, mom.
Rocco!
Come in!
- Hi, Roberto!
- Hi!
- Good evening!
- Good evening!
- Why did you come?
- She called.
- She want to surprise you.
- This is great, mom, thank you.
Please, come in!
Great the dinner, congratulations!
Thank you.
I had to send it Filomena.
Does not give to work.
I have a surprise for you.
I fetched Roberto's cheese.
- Really?
I did it.
this is beautiful!
Did you do it really?
Well with Rocco.
Inside is curd cheese.
- And this basket?
- My father I got it yet in my childhood.
I've made it herein the first my cheese.
Now you too.
- We taste it?
.
- Yes.
- Good.
This beautiful.
- Roberto created.
- Beautiful!
And... this all?
Only for me?
- Look at the heart.
- Great.
- But well have bought you!
- Taste it mom
All right, we taste it.
Unfortunately the cheese not between my favourite foods.
Eat yet, you do not feel it otherwise heart of cheese.
Like that, than the people.
If you stop the at outside, you may not notice it, how what inside.
- Did you teach this to him?
- No.
I think, Roberto knew this already somehow.
All right, I taste heart of cheese.
- This is very delicate!
- See?
Really it's good.
I was born in Florida.
But I lived until my 25 years ages in Los Angeles.
I came on holiday into Italy with my girlfriend ... and I got to know my husband.
Here you go
- And?
- My girlfriend went home alone.
- I see.
One?
- Yes, thank you.
- Translating books may be interesting.
- It was my passion.
Good, because it distracts my attention.
- You do not have to be worried already.
Because Roberto will heal.
Look, he asleep.
This way.
Thank you, Rocco.
Everybody would not have done it, what you.
I'm sorry!
Only so natural, how I shall be on first name terms with you.
Good night!
Good night!
All right, study only!
Yes, Today my mood is good.
What do you say, he lover?
Care about the learning only.
Not at all!
Hello, mommy!
- Honey!
- I go to Rocco.
Come here!
Do I not receive a kiss?
I have to go into Reggio, in a labour issue.
- For me i gotta go?
.
- Decide it.
Do you not want to see the Daddy?
Yes, may not be only.
I have to help Rocco.
- Roberto, be sincere!
- I stay here rather.
Reggióban csak zavarnék.
The Daddy loves you very much.
Better, than you would believe it.
The adults may be make a mistakes.
I was make mistake when I scolded you, and I did not release you to Rocco.
But you talk to me at least.
Hi!
- Here wanted to let?
- You have to be accurate on the meetings.
I was joking.
Come, I help to take horse.
Use that stool.
- This here?
- Yes.
Come on!
- You are ready?
- Yes.
Rocco!
That's wonderful!
- The author was very enthusiastic.
- Yes.
Now what?
Do we dine together?
- Not, I would surprise it rather Ferdinando.
- Why, you did not say that you come?
Not, I thought about surprising it.
Julia!
Please, wait for me!
Look at that peak.
There is an eagle nest there, see?
The eagles come back in all years.
- To be on holiday?
- In a certain sense.
Some come here to build a nest, others to North-Europe they are going, they start back then.
They winter in Africa, in the warm countries.
Wonderful.
They are free really.
They do what they want.
- They're leaving, they come back...
- Anybody may do this.
But this does not mean that you are free yet
The man's life is a constant travel.
But the most important one:
to understand, where is your place.
- It is your real home.
- My home is here.
You are too small yet it, that be allowed to decide this.
Your home is there temporarily, where your parents.
I would like to fly sometimes, than the eagles.
Stand up!
There is not need for wings to the flying.
Enough sometimes, if you close your eye.
Close your eye.
All right
And now breathe good deep ones!
Calmly.
And now... concentrate on that point where your heart is.
Where your breath forms.
The centre is there.
Its middle.
You feel how your heart beat?
Everybody's heart beat in the same manner.
Even the eagles' heart.
There is no difference.
The only difference that they fly, and you may dream about him, that you do it.
And you may dream about many other things, and you may fulfil them, if you believe in him
And the world will be yours when you realize your dream.
And it nobody may take from you what you conquered.
You become an eagle in that moment.
I found this very once.
The feather of a male eagle.
Allegedly protects because of the trouble.
Now already yours.
- And what will be with you without it?
- Do not be worried only.
You have to feel if its time was here, that an important thing give present.
Thank you, Rocco.
- As if I would be a small goat?
- Bizbilio is an act so.
- But great, this delicate!
- See?
I guessed something.
Was many child in the hospital on the chemotherapy.
I believed it, that if ready the cheese, we could sell it in the fair, and we could use the income onto beneficent aims.
We made heart-shaped baskets.
One like that, than yours, and its name will be Aspromonte's heart.
- Roberto, it's getting late, go home!
- So, yes or no?
I don't know.
I am not strolling away into the village-fairs.
The turmoil is too big.
And then I have to work a lot.
I maked 50 cheeses till now.
950 are missing yet if I count it well.
Are you not glad that you may help other ones?
- For who they need you.
- But why with the cheese?
It is possible to do charity some other way.
Because if invincible one does, then may overcome the illnesses, no?
Good, so be it.
But only a little.
Thank you, Rocco.
I love you.
I tell it to the mom.
I swear, Julia, misunderstood.
Only from work there was spoken word.
Yes, there was a mistake possibly to take away into the restaurant, but nothing more.
- There was not need for this.
- No?
.
- How would you have responded in my place?
I would have found an answer possibly my doubts.
Come on, Julia.
You changed totally since Roberto's illness.
As if I would not exist already.
I need you though.
And Roberto?
Do you not think that he needs his father?
You changed rather.
You do not touch him already.
You were other once.
You took it away to go rowing and to play football
However more may not do these already.
But many other, yes.
And does it without you, Ferdinando.
Got it?
You did not ask it, where is he.
- Good day, Rocco!
- Good day!
He is Ferdinando, my husband.
You know each other, no?
- Hi, Ferdinando!
- Where is my son?
- He milks the goats.
- He milks the goats?
Are you joking now?
I call it here immediately.
Would this be the relaxation according to you?
And if he harms him if he is between animals?
He is much better already.
Daddy!
I milk twenty litres!
- Come on, let's go home!
- Now?
Look at Rocco's cheese before.
We sell it in the fair then.
I did it.
Sure.
Let us be going already now.
You do not want to come home into Reggio?
Your friends are waiting already at home.
- Oh, shall we go!
- Gather up your thing!
- Hi, Marco!
Hi, Rocco!
- Hi!
Marco, do not speak up now!
Let us finish the milking.
- I do not want to go back into Reggio.
- I know, honey.
I do not want to go back.
Here the fair.
We have to sell the cheese.
You notice it, we solve everything somehow.
Don't worry, entrust this to me only.
I get along with Rocco so well.
I made a cheese, I learn a lot.
For what fetched from him?
You notice it, you may go then to Rocco.
Don't worry about it, okay?
Let us go home now.
Mr. Ventura!
- Mr. Ventura!
- I'm here.
Good day, dr.
Zagari!
Newer examination?
Not, unfortunately that way no need.
Everything constant.
You know my work well, and exactly you know that my cheese is healthy.
I'm sorry, Mr. Ventura, but I have to suspend your business temporarily.
Here the order.
May you not sell a cheese, henceforth.
- What?
- I repeat it.
May you not sell a cheese, henceforth.
While you do cleanness.
Good bye!
- The Daddy and i we come back soon, okay?
- All right.
Honey, we are late yet.
Let's go!
Then after the film in bed, OK?
Hi!
Filomena, do not forget it if anything is a trouble is, call in my mobile phone!
- Don't worry!
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, mom!
Good night!
- Filomena, look after him.
- Good.
A new restaurant opened.
Are you there, hi!
I am glad that you come, like this I present it Bortolotti lord.
- He may be of benefit to you in the hotel yet.
- Sure.
- And we have to celebrate the victory.
- What kind of victory?
Ventura stood in the our way for our plan and now they suspended, it will be obliged to sell his land.
- Igazam van?
.
- I presuppose it, yes.
- What?
Was suspended?
- May not sell his cheese, his revenue source was not left so.
Shortly: game over.
What's wrong with you?
I feel badly I am giddy.
I'm sorry, but I would not be going rather with you.
I would ruin the evening only.
- What happened to him?
- Is not well, I stay here then.
No, that really no need.
Go, Bortolotti lord waits for you certainly already.
But...
Ferdinando!
His mood is like this today.
Shall we go!
For everybody i did say that, that Julia comes with us.
But too bad.
And you too... there are many women in Calabria, and you just needed an American?
- Rocco!
It's me.
- Julia!
- What are you doing here?
- I heard about what happened.
I'm sorry.
Your brother-in-law is safe happy one now.
Many men may be glad with him.
Not me, trust me!
I am not happy.
I understand you.
It was a mistake that I gave up this country.
And it was a mistake that I came back.
Because my father did not live already then and I did not have a family already.
There was a debt only, many debts.
Because i...
I left them alone.
I may have put it right in such a way only that I started everything over again.
I wanted to save my ancestors' work.
And see, this did not succeed.
You may not speak so, Rocco!
You must not give it up!
I'm sorry!
I did not want it.
I forgot it already, what a woman's embrace.
I'm sorry.
And I forgot the good things of the life.
While I did not meet with Roberto... and with you.
Roberto would have liked selling his cheese in the fair.
- We do it.
- But it no way.
What could be made yet with me?
One more time suspend?
To confine?
Not, this i don't care.
I do not want to disappoint him.
He will be very happy.
When the building operations are beginning,Bortolotti lord?
.
My son does not work, unemployed worker.
If the five-star hotel is ready, will be his workplace.
Excuse me, that I interrupt, but I believe it so,Ventura does not sell his land, even because of the suspension.
More headstrong, than his father.
Goes mouldy together with his cheeses rather,
- but does not give it up.
- A matter of time, Ferdinando.
Excuse me!
For everybody tiramisu please, thank you!
His sibling has truth partly, mayor lord.
That this goat-herd let ruin it a matter of time really.
But months may pass till then.
So a much more drastic method is needed.
This is the truth here.
I'm sorry, but what you mean with this?
A man until years may shift on the edge of the depths, but if he has to fall into him anyway once, no object, if we "help" him?
!
And what you understand by "help"?
I do not know it because I am layman at the cheeses.
Are you better already?
For me tomorrow back up is needed to do into Reggio.
Why do you not come with me?
I see it so, Roberto is better already.
- He does not have time yet here.
- We ask him because of that.
I thought we onto two.
Julia!
Julia!
I sacrificed everything for Roberto.
And I would do it a hundred times, a thousand times.
But is better already now.
And I am calmer.
I would like to care about myself a little bit.
I do not want to lose you!
I cannot live without you.
Well, not really I wanted this to hear from you.
I don't know, Julia, totally drive crazy.
What did you want to hear?
- How you love me.
- Of course, I love you.
The "I cannot live without you" does not report the same one?
You may say this to anybody.
Not at all same thing.
I handed in the application already, but nothing yet.
You know, how slow these.
From where I would have known that this much paper is needed?
- Dora!
You would do something?
.
- Yes, sure.
We have to solve our problem before only.
- What kind of trouble?
- You know, onto the trademark our application handed in.
They responded in the ministry that the documentation is incomplete.
Really, Rocco!
You would be able to help, since you are skilled at this.
Join in the co-operative, and you will be the president.
I may help really well, possibly.
I have my own method.
Listen, it would like to be rented one counter onto the fair, you arrange it?
You never wanted to participate in it.
Now yes, when you may not sell your cheese?
- I promised it to Spadafore's nephew.
- Spadafore's nephew?
- This is complicated.
I explain it then.
- Good.
- May I count on you then?
- Yes.
They are whispering that the mother of Spadafore's nephew is a very beautiful woman.
They are whispering that you chatter too much.
Daddy!
Daddy!
- Are you sure?
- You want it it work?
Keep silent then, and hurry up!
Hurry up!
Come on, open it!
Be watching it, that not somebody comes.
Come on!
Strange.
Rocco never attended the village-fair yet.
This is only a desperate attempt.
Do you know that they offer the income for a beneficent aim?
In favour of the tumourous children.
In fact not free.
You know Rocco's troubles.
But if he goes onto beneficent aims, we may turn a blind eye to it then, indeed I take from him, that let me contribute to the case.
- Shall we go!
- OK.
Good night, Roberto!
I would like to take from the cheese, that i too let me contribute to the beneficent aims.
Free?
- What?
- The thing does not work.
I tested everything, but...
Ow, the cheese, I am badly!
Very badly!
Rocco's cheese was poisonous!
Poisonous!
Do not eat from Rocco's cheese.
Call a doctor.
Call a doctor.
- Look up Dr. Valentin.
- Mom, I am badly!
Oh my god, Roberto, what happen?
I am badly, i think, I will vomit!
- Filomena!
- They poisoned the cheese!
- It was poisoned?
What are you talking about?
This cheese was poisonous.
You take it already now, how why did they withdraw your permit?
You poison the people.
But this time your end!
Your own cheese was the ruin of you.
Did you grasp it finally?
- Angelo, calm down!
- Now already sure, that you have to close down your shop!
- You would calm down?
.
- Not shove around, you!
Watch out!
Let now!
What's going on?
Everybody's seeing, right?
.
This man hit me!
Raised his hand against the mayor, during the fulfilment of his task.
- He attacked an official.
- But he provoked!
I'm sorry, come with us!
Everybody's seeing?
.
Rocco raised his hand against me.
This is your friend!
You did not eat so much fortunately from it, that catch food poisoning from it.
The cheese was not the wrong one.
It's not true, mom?
I did not because of the cheese feel badly myself.
Tell to him.
Mom!
A homeland would be needed after all possibly to do.
What do you say?
There is everybody against Rocco.
Everybody!
Roberto!
Roberto!
Rocco!
Rocco!
Rocco!
Rocco!
Let us go to Rocco.
I know where he is.
Rocco!
Rocco!
Rocco!
I am Roberto, answer me!
Rocco!
Rocco!
Rocco!
In starring:
THE MAN, WHO DREAMED ABOUT EAGLES, Part 2.
Cast:
Music:
Sergeant lord, what am I doing here?
They provoked.
Does not depend on me Tell it to the mayor.
Director of Photography:
Ms. Julia!
Your coffee.
Á, Filomena.
I slept through it here on the couch.
- I noticed.
- What is a fragrance!
- Of course,because I was cooking now.
- Thank you.
Ms. Julia!
Do you know it already?
Rocco Ventura is in a prison.
- In a prison?
- Because he brawled with his brother-in-law, and the...
Only quietly!
Roberto sleeps.
Poor Rocco.
Roberto!
Honey!
Roberto!
Mom, i'm going, I look up Rocco.
Don't worry about me!
Roby.
- Thank you, really just a minute.
Thank you.
- Come!
Dora!
Was there very need like that for this really?
I know, I made a mistake.
How are the poisoned people?
How they could be?
Badly.
Very badly.
But your situation the baddest one.
They reserved all of your cheeses.
What do you mean?
All of them, which I maked?
All three hundred?
Only from a precaution, because of the yesterday's poisoning.
But you set about selling a cheese in the fair after the happening?
Dora, you believe that my cheese poisoned the people?
No.
I do not believe it.
But I doesn't matter.
I doesn't matter nothing.
- And what you want to do now?
- I am looking Rocco Ventura.
- Julia!
- Rocco!
- Roberto escaped!
- What, escaped?
I have found this on his pillow.
I know, where did he go.
I have to get out.
- I have to get out from here!
- What would speak the mayor lord?
Call it promptly.
Please, call it!
What sight, right?
This conceited chap, maked his cheese in the cave.
He poisoned half of the village.
Himself was the ruin of him.
Not exactly.
If I do not take it in a hand the thing, we are never freed from him.
Do not say that you did not realise it already.
Why I did not give for you to taste the cheese yesterday?
- It was you did it, who...?
- Do not be shouting.
For Rocco Ventura now already failed.
So that selling his land will be obliged, you did not want this?
Yeah, but not like this!
I know Rocco since years already.
I would have convinced it only finally.
- What are you doing?
- How's that what?
It doesn't matter, happened so, we leave it.
And otherwise:
I did it for Calidonia.
Yes.
Says, sergeant!
Where this child may have disappeared, i don't understand.
- Angelo, let go get out!
- What do you know about this?
- I know, where may have gone.
He is at the Eagle gable.
- Do not be worried only!
I alarmed the gendarmes, the forestry, the civil defence,they find.
Rocco knows that country so, than his palm.
And you know this well.
Annul that denunciation.
Now already all clear, of course.
You thought this up well, what?
Would you grasp that Roberto is in danger finally?
Speak in order for it to be allowed get out, now!
Not dare to shout at me!
You should have paid attention to him!
What do you want?
.
My land, my house?
Speak for Bortolotti, and everything I sell it.
I promise this.
Let me out, and I sign anything for you.
Rocco!
You went mad!
I have to do it.
- Did you send the denunciation onto the public prosecutor's office?
- Not yet.
Let it out then.
I settle it with your superiors then.
- Thank you, Angelo.
- Does your husband know it already?
- No, not yet.
- What you wait for then?
- Speak to him you, please!
- "Speak to him you too"
These Americans.
These Americans.
- What's going on?
- We reserve everything.
I'm sorry, this regulation.
If you have an objection, you know it where find me.
This is not my time now
- What did he say?
- Roger that.
But the goats were not stolen.
Says it, some goats are missing, but according to me Roberto took them away.
- You can to ride?
.
- A little.
How on earth did it happen?
Well nobody paid attention to my son?
Happened to a night, already i told you.
But because of that calm down, we find it.
They send out a helicopter soon.
- And my wife?
- Your wife?
Your wife...
She is in the mountains with Rocco, and you released it with him?
We have to go on foot.
Thank you, Nino.
- You will endure it certainly?
- I have to like it anyway.
- All right.
Rocco!
I am sorry very much, which happened with you.
Roberto matter only now.
Rocco finds it.
We know.
- Yes.
But I hope that he finds him alive.
But you take away his land if Rocco saves the child?
- He promised to sell it.
- And this came in handy for you now.
Look, I want nobody to use, if this is of what you think.
- He should have sold out anyway.
- You are so much sure of this?
Dora!
Do not deal with Rocco.
Only waste of time.
Find somebody for yourself.
One like that, who in truth to appreciate can.
I would not value it possibly the somebody.
Roberto!
Roberto!
Atlas!
This is the sound of Atlas!
Roberto!
Roberto!
His walkie-talkie is switched on, but I do not hear him.
He may not be like that far.
He is there below!
I go down, stay here!
It may not be, my son is there below.
Roberto!
Roberto, honey!
Oh, my God!
Alive!
- Breathe, honey!
Oh, my God!
- He solves a goat presumably.
- All milk everywhere.
Your son is a superb little chap.
- Honey!
Bizbilio!
Roberto, Roberto!
Can you hear me, honey?
- Where Roberto is?
.
- Inside.
The doctor just examines it, do not let in.
What want did this child?
And you?
.
Where were you?
Did you not look after him?
"...not suit for regulations of Europe Union"
Roberto wake up, you may go in to it.
But please, no tire it!
Roberto, tiny!
My son!
I'm here, tiny.
Don't cry, my small son!
I came for Marco.
I take it home promptly now.
- Ask him it, what do you want.
- My son does what I say to him.
Do you not think that you are be wrong?
And you never you are be wrong?
Since you did big trouble.
Relax!
Make what your mother says.
Go home!
Maybe better like this.
Marco, don't give up!
- Excuse me, I am looking Roberto Spadafore. - 16 room.
- Thank you.
Come in!
- Hi, my champion!
- However you reached here.
- How are you?
- I am.
- You did big trouble.
- But you struck my uncle.
I know, and i'm sorry.
- My uncle deserved.
- Not, I made a mistake.
Before you would act, to think is needed.
And this is valid for you.
How you will made it it a thousand cheeses?
I may not help now.
- You heal only.
- How much maked?
300?
, 350?
- I don't know.
- Since you always constantly.
What is it, what happened?
You conceal something from me, right?
No, no happened nothing.
- Thank you, doctor lord.
- Keep still only.
- Promise me, we made cheeses, again if I may come out from here.
Our cheese.
I promise.
You have to tolerate a small one yet.
You saved my life.
You escaped from yourself because you drank the goat's milk.
I never remember him if you do not tell Bizbilio's story.
- Really, Bizbilio how are he?
- Yet he is getting frightened.
- He eat little.
- I'm sorry.
Make him understand that he has to eat it.
He will eat if he discovers that you are better already.
- Tell it to him then, that I eat it already.
- And is that right?
I do not know it now.
I feel tired.
Understandable.
But you heal soon if you eat.
You are invincible now already, than in the legend.
- Really?
- Yes.
- The eagle feather!
- You lost it at the Eagle gable.
But you are not angry at me?
Are you not angry?
No.
You are like that for me, as if you would be my son.
Listen, Rocco!
I know it well, that not from the cheese I was badly.
Do not think of this.
I have to go now.
Rocco, wait!
Important, that everybody need to know this.
Will be so.
Rocco!
Thank you.
Hi!
Ferdinando!
Hi!
Roberto got exhausted very much, and his need would be even onto a MR examination.
The machine does not work here, unfortunately.
Take it away according to me into Reggio Calabria.
All right.
That's great.
We're goin home.
Back up our old life.
Courage, Ma'am!
This is only an examination.
- What shall I make with this cheese?
- Have it examined.
Totally other his flavour, not my cheese.
They falsified it according to me.
- And who falsified it?
- I don't know.
But I have to get back my permit and my cheese.
This is here the evidence that I did not poison the cheese.
Look, Ventura.
If in truth the cheese was falsified, how you prove that you did not make it?
Yes, i see.
- Good bye, Mr. Zagar!
- Hey, Ventura!
Let us clear something up.
For me nothing my trouble with you.
I give back all of your cheeses,if to clear, you has nothing to do with the thing.
The permit depends on you only.
Of course, if I observe your little rules.
Exactly.
Because these rules means nothing to you.
Next dies possibly if somebody gets into a hospital.
You are assured, that the in your method was not poisoning?
Yes!
- I come in?
- Mr. Bortolotti!
Come in, I waited you already!
- Good day!
- Good day!
How are you?
Well.
And you?
It is its time in order for us to be on familiar terms.
Since we are a kind of companions, no?
Well, as you believe it.
Tessék.
- So Ventura through it.
- He promised it, signing the contract.
And the others, whom the their land are our need?
They never caused a problem.
They wait for a good offer only, that they say: yes.
So from here flat the road.
- In all meaning?
- Well, yes.
We have to smooth down quite a lot of roads yet.
It is not possible to recognize the valley then having finished the works.
Not, this maybe better, if we do not mention it.
You know that this is.
From an experience I say it.
The environmentalist organisations in many cases is proliferate quickly
- and our time is wasted only.
- Time and much money.
How shall we help the developing countries and ourselves?
- Rocco Ventura
Free?
Rocco!
- I would have liked seeing, how are you?
- I'm okay, thank you.
My wife and my son.
- I would not have believed it.
For you...
- No.
There is nothing already for me.
My father wanted it, that let me work with him.
But I had ambitions.
Not interested the cheese, neither the family possession.
- I went away despite his will from here.
- And what did you do?
I studied at a university in Milan, and I became a lawyer.
- Lawyer?
.
- I got to know my wife there.
He was a doctor.
We wandered over half of the world by her.
Africa, Latin America.
I wanted to help the third world.
And I lugged my wife and my son with myself.
- And then?
- I worked a lot.
The lawyer of the hopeless ones, angels of the poor ones
So the people named me, and I did everything, that let me prove it: that's true.
And was not true?
I was full in myself and my successes.
I did not stop until a minute.
I took my family from one of the villages into the other one, as if there would have been puppets in a game only.
Until finally a day, while I was on ingress...
I'm sorry.
I did not know it about this really.
This is was my mistake only.
I should not have left them alone.
Roberto reminds of your son, right?
Better, if you take it away from here.
I can harm only the near me for living ones.
Please, no speak so!
And how I should speak it?
I ruined my family.
And your son died because of me almost.
Forgive yourself.
You suffered a lot already.
What could I give to you?
My troubles?
.
My failures?
And if I would be happy with you?
And you do not think Roberto?
Neki már van apja.
Let us not meet rather longer then.
Good.
We go back into Reggio on Tuesday.
We leave at four p.m. Roberto would like you to say goodbye to him.
Why do you read it?
This agreement from the selling of your land.
What I showed is equal to the sketch.
- I revise the details.
My goats do they remain?
- Don't worry, they yes.
Here you go, here.
This is the advance.
So, how you like our little tourist centre?
The old one is here, and the new one is there.
- Very many things will be better in Calidonia.
- Mainly for you.
Mr. Bortolotti was rather generous with you.
This very much money, and comes well now for you, that you were unemployed.
So I may get back my permit.
- Sure, if somebody does not want to do harm to me.
Do not play the victim, Ventura.
Be angry at yourself rather.
Because you do not want to keep pace with the development.
- My cheese does not need this.
- So your cheese?
Oh see, you ruin it here.
Because you believe it, that only yours.
And lose, because you fight alone.
In the village is the co-operative.
But does not interest you.
All the time you talk about the traditions, the past, the land.
Don't you see, that the land not only a word?
The land a world what consists of people, stories, and not from one single person, a hermit like this.
Come in.
I present it Serafino Maniero, Pipo Greco...
- Good day!
- Good day!
- Come on, they my friends.
From Co-operative of Aspromonte.
They are the friends of the progress and the village.
- How do you do.
- All right, now, that Rocco Ventura signed it, we may start the negotiations.
Come, Serafino, we begin it with you.
So...
Daddy, turn down the telly!
Can you not to look at home?
Who looks after the shop if I go home?
- Really, I did not give a thought to this.
- Dora!
Good, make here, I am going then next.
- But why you sold everything, Rocco?
.
- Because I promised it.
There is not everything yet disappearing.
You may forego the contract
- if you pay the punishment.
- And from what let me pay?
If I think about us having played the space here in our childhood...
But drove away, because I was a girl, and the smallest one.
And i I stole my older brother's football player pictures for you.
And I protected you when he noticed it, and wanted to punish.
- I have to go into the bank.
- Good.
I'm sorry, Mr. Ventura, but yet yeah a sum does not enough the arrear.
You let your house's land right and ownership, indeed you do not have a permit already.
I have into pawn your firm and your animals.
- What?
.
The goats?
.
- Unfortunately yes.
The bank will be obliged to take steps,if you are not solvent.
But how I shall be solvent without my goats?
- You are Mr. R. Ventura?
- Rocco Ventura.
I am the executor.
- I came in order that I keep it busy your animals.
- Now?
I am sorry that you leave.
Listen, why you do not move here if Roberto heals?
I arrange that you should guide the hotel
I was never glad that I may go away yet.
- Come on.
- Too much things does not like here.
- I entrust it in Julia.
But I saw Rocco, that...
- What you do not remember?
Come on, Rocco is a crab, you know that.
Otherwise for his career end.
I explain it immediately, let's see how the land lies.
It is in these documents, that you have 80 goats and 75 sheep.
- Almost.
- Not, must be very accurate.
- If you say so.
- Here sign it!
So exactly 80 goats and 75 sheeps.
You are his inspector henceforth the reserved for stocks.
- Explain this.
- With a franchise and criminal responsibility you to come under for the reserved animals, representing the bank's interests.
Would be needed with a flock like that actually to deal, what is not mine already.
Unless you do not pay somebody who the judiciary appoints.
No, thanks, I solve it then.
Hello!
I am looking for Roberto Spadafore.
Room 16.
Did he come already?
Thank you.
- I'm sorry, I have to go now.
- I have to finish the minutes yet.
- You finish!
- All right, but says, your dog is angry?
It depends the visitor.
No, you hold still, I did not reserved you.
So?
Are you inclined to a departure?
- You said it, at four p.m..
Not yet so much.
- Well we leave before.
Are you not glad?
I have to go back into the hotel yet.
I am busy yet.
I have to say goodbye to a my friend.
- And who is it?
.
- Only a friend.
Julia!
Roberto!
Julia!
Roberto!
We have to wait Rocco.
Promised for mom to reach here before four p.m., that let him say goodbye.
- Promised for mom?
- Yes.
He forgot it possibly.
Rocco never forgot about me yet.
What do you say if I cook ravioli?
Roberto?
That favourite of yours.
He promised that we made a cheese together again if I heal.
Such his word of honour.
Since may not made a cheese already.
- He lost his flock and his permit.
- Not, i can't believe it!
What's up with you, Ferdinando?
.
Do you not see that you excite it?
- But it's the truth.
- Mom, is that right?
Is what a dad said true?
It's okay, Roberto, try to calm down!
I do not want to calm down.
I want to talk to Rocco!
Please, Ferdinando, stop!
Roberto, Roberto!
- Roberto, i'm sorry, I did not want it!
- Leave it only, I arrange it then.
Come, honey!
Stand up!
Dad, he Rocco!
Do not leave yet.
Rocco!
Rocco!
- I knew that you did not forget about me.
- How I could have made it?
.
My daddy said it, that we may not made a cheese longer, and that it reserved your flock.
That's right.
Your daddy has truth.
And reserved Bizbillio?
Come, let us leave now!
You promised that we will made a cheese together.
You said it, I must not surrender.
You must not surrender it for you now then.
Come, Roberto!
Shall we go!
Relax, I milk you.
the pain is over so.
I'm coming, coming.
Steel, plastic.
We try it.
We do it the way.
Roberto understands it then.
Oh, what do you think?
We would get the permission to this cheese already.
And maybe, that not too so much bad.
Not bad, right?
It is equal to the norms.
However not our cheese.
I'm not hungry, I go into my room.
- Sit down, and finish the eating!
- I do not have a mood.
Enough, this are exaggerating really already!
Why do you have to behave so?
Calm down, honey!
What, I may not scold my own son already?
- Try to understand it.
- Sure, let me understand everybody.
És engem mikor fognak megérteni?
And when you will be understand me?
What I did bad?
Why may not have a normal family for me?
A normal my son?
Tell, you take this seriously?
Julia!
- You would like me to stay here?
.
- Don't worry, I fall asleep immediately.
- Good night, my heart!
- You, too, mom.
Dora, you're right.
Not only I made cheese in the caves.
- And?
It was a mistake that I did not enter the co-operative.
- Onto this Spadafore realised.
- So Spadafore, and not me.
Do not be grieving.
Let's get to work!
Good, but i don't understand.
What's this about?
I do not surrender.
I decided:
I enter into the aspromonte cheese manufacturers' co-operative, this not everything.
I want to get the trademark my cheese.
Hey!
Somebody is needed, who helps, to compile the documentation?
I am here.
I am going promptly, and I speak to the others.
Listen to me, you would have these examined?
I want to find it out, from what there were so much badly man.
I did a bacteriology examination.
Good.
Serafino?
I have a my good news.
We are glad that you want to enter on the co-operative, you could have done it earlier.
- Better late than never.
- Rocco!
You signed it already it signing a contract from the selling, and the goats it was reserved.
Why would you do it?
- This is a conceptual question for me.
- The conceptual questions do not fill your pockets.
What is there with you?
The trademark is the co-operative first.
Let us be big afterwards then.
Now, you would dissuade when we found somebody who helps?
We lost our courage possibly.
We wasted too much time already,
- and the things are not going unfortunately fine.
- But what let Rocco speak?
He is doing worse at everybody.
Makes it for us, not for himself.
The co-operative is found yet whatever.
Write a commission.
I deal with the application longer, yet if I have to go into Rome.
Speak then.
Shall we go!
I do not have courage to tell it to him.
Myself feel it a betrayer.
I maybe not?
And when a trademark would be given to us?
Come on.
- Nino!
Take water onto that table.
- Immediately.
- Thank you.
- Good evening!
- Good evening, Ma'am!
- Salvatore, please!
You would watch whether everything is ready in the kitchen?
Yes, ma'am.
- Your account.
- Thank you.
- It MR examination away is needed to make?
- After CT we'll see.
It is not visible that he would have improved, right, doctor lord?
He may not improve while he tightened this much.
What can I do me?
.
We I could make something else yet?
He needs a big change.
Roberto has to relax.
And for you, too, Ma'am.
- Rocco!
- Yes.
The postman left this letter in the shop.
It is came from the ministry.
Read it.
"dear Mr. Ventura!
With a reference it onto a trademark application handed in by you, we enclose it...
Rocco!
They accepted your application!
You have to go into Rome to present the full substance!
- And the examination of the cheese?
- It is not yet ready.
You know, how slow.
- You urge they!
- Good.
I urge they.
I urge they.
Roberto, honey!
I maked a delicate sandwich.
Eat it!
Do it for me.
I do not love it when you are so sad.
Lead back to Rocco.
I have an idea.
You get stronger first you eat everything, and you heal.
I talk it over with your father.
My father does not wish anyway.
But i don't understand, why not?
!
You know, he is worried about you very much.
He is afraid that you go back alone onto the Eagle gable.
And if I promise it, I do not go there?
It is the important one that everything was resolved.
Will not be at least its consequences.
Are you alone?
Can you talk?
That imbecile one risked a lot.
And it is possible to know about how much spoiled milk he put into it?
He claims that he contaminated the milk with little portions.
But if somebody would have died, and the police initiates a serious investigation?
!
- I see.
But listen already now, what are you doing!
Anyway inform, if there is some news, all right?
Hi, Angelo!
Hi!
- Julia!
- Hi!
- Hi!
- From Rome they looked me.
What are you doing?
- I revise it the cheques of Calidonia.
- OK.
I'm going, i'll see you later.
- OK, hi!
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, Daddy!
Hi, Dora!
Yes, I am in Rome, in the hotel.
Don't worry, it's okay.
Listen, you have news from the examination?
How?
What?
Until how much time does yet?
My love!
You are here yet?
Darling!
Roberto, are you awake?
We have to help for Rocco.
For Roberto done so much
- and now into trouble avoided because of me.
- Why your mistake would be?
Enough!
Oh, my God!
Ferdinando.
You have to talk to him sooner or later.
Do not say that you are afraid to stand in front of him.
- Julia, I not know you.
I'm not scared.
I do not respect him already only.
I never forgive him it, that he what do it.
- We arrived to Rocco?
.
- Honey!
Before Valenti doctor lord waits for us.
He wants to examine.
- Good day, Filomena!
- Good day, Ma'am!
Roberto, come here!
The doctor lord wants to examine.
- I like it here?
- All bustle.
No starts again, Isabella!
Filomena, you would help?
- Good Day!
- Good Day!
- Welcome!
- Thank you.
I stay here until some days.
- I thought, does not like this place.
- They would like to find it out about Roberto's treatment much.
Totally away magic is done to me.
So you that famous Valenti doctor lord?
- They say it.
- How do you do.
- I enjoy.
Come, Roberto!
Sigh.
One more!
You grew thin very much.
You have to eat more.
You drink milk?
I would drink if it would be the milk of Rocco's goat.
I try to compose understandably.
If you do not get fat a lot of kilos
I will to nourish you intravenously.
You decide.
- You want to be well or badly?
- It doesn't matter, nothing changes anyway.
- It doesn't matter?
.
- My parents quarrel, Rocco got into trouble, and loses his economy.
Who is disposed towards me near, it wrong happens.
Do not speak so, my small son!
One like this yet only to think neither free, got it?
He will be better if he sees again Rocco.
But Rocco was leave.
- He was leave?
- He is in Rome.
- He was leave?
- He is in Rome.
- Good day, where the trademark commission?
- On third floor, the end of corridor
- Thank you.
You applied to discuss the application for the trademark, which one " Land of Aspromonte" named co-operative handed in.
We learned of the officer's medical service of Reggio Calabria found more irregularity in your economy.
But you assured the commission that examinations support it: you have nothing to do with the case.
But you may prove that the aspromonte cheese is not dangerous onto the consumers' health.
- Yes.
- All right, we wait for the result of the examinations then.
Thank you.
Please, Mr. Rocco Ventura!
Dad, turn down the telly!
No, thanks.
Only tells for him, that Dora Giangreco was looking for it.
Thank you.
- Good day
- Godd day!
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure.
I knew.
I knew that was somebody's hand in poison affair.
We have to inform Rocco.
We can clear his name.
I know it already, how.
- When did you have this made?
- Already once, I obtained the result today only.
- We have to find Rocco anyway.
- I arrange it.
Trust me!
I would like to help him.
I know.
I understood everything.
Go then.
I love Rocco, and... make it if you can make him happy!
Because he deserves it.
Thank you.
- Go!
- Good.
- Rocco!
- Roberto!
- How's that you are here?
- We got on the first through line.
Roberto needs you.
- And I...
- And you.
Now already got it?
.
Somebody cow's milk given to your goat's milk, and the cow's milk was infected.
- Who cultivated this he was verdant.
- Yet fortune.
Not be our evidence now if he goat's milk would have been used.
I feel wrong myself in the case, Rocco.
I don't know, how I tell, but...
My husband knew about the poisoning.
Tudott róla, és nem mondott semmit.
He knew, and said nothing.
I decided because of this that I leave him.
You did not tell it to Roberto, right?
You think of Roberto even in a moment like this?
When do you think of yourself?
Tell, why did you come here?
You said it, we never meet longer.
Because I have to help you.
And...
And?
Something was stronger at you.
- Well you are here?
.
I thought, you let me alone.
- No, Roberto.
- No, honey.
I may sleep at tonight with Rocco in a room?
Not, honey, we have an own room.
- Do we go away to eat a pizza today?
- Good!
Superb idea.
- Hi, Ferdinando!
- Julia, where are you?
I was worried about you very much.
Don't worry, we are in Rome only.
So right?
I did not want to believe.
Don't you get it?
All of Calidonia talks about this.
- My elder brother he doesn't know, what he should say.
- And you are worried about this?
Listen, Ferdinando!
I am here in order that I help Rocco.
You know that, injustice happened to him.
- Mom, you give it to me?
.
Your son wants to talk to you.
- Daddy?
- Hello, Roberto!
- I may ask something of you?
- Yes, tell!
Do not shout at us.
We make a good thing, and you will be proud of us then.
All right.
But come back now into Reggio, and we talk it over.
- Hi, dad!
- Hi!
My cheese did not cause the food poisoning, but a false cheese, which does not answer altogether, for the features of aspromonte cheese.
All right, we attach these documents to the file.
Do you have a question yet?
Like that what Mr. Ventura can respond only?
Mr. Ventura, the wall of cave where it is aspromonte cheese you made it, not flat, i mean cannot be whitewashed.
Will you observe the rules defined by European Union?
With this noble mildew you not insure the suitable circumstances.
Do you use a steel dropper then?
Is not incuded in these documents, how the relocation of the flocks happens when.
Will you store the cheese in plastic baskets instead of a wicker basket?
Do you observe the union rules affecting the pasture change in the case of the flocks?
There is a document, which gives an answer to all of their questions possibly.
The organizing of the hygiene, the hygienic cheque but taken into consideration the traditional making manners of the aspromonte cheese.
I entrust the decision to you.
All right.
We examine the documentation handed in soon,
- afterwards inform our decision.
- Thank you.
- So, what happened?
- Did they grant the trademark?
They decide about him soon, this was said to me.
Dear advisable lords!
Before I would open the seat,
Mr. Umberto Bortolotti he would like to announce something.
- There you go.
- Thank you, mayor lord.
As you know it, day after tomorrow we start the work, and we break down Rocco Ventura's house first.
Wait a second!
Rocco Ventura's house?
- I thought, it is not broken down.
- That house like that,than an ancient monument.
We have to think of the future now.
The ancient monument is secondary only.
The house's demolition is not incuded in the plan.
- Now, yes.
Otherwise, the house mine.
- Not, one moment.
Rocco Ventura yet only it signing a contract signed it.
The house yet Rocco's
But the contract after three days expires.
The selling takes effect then, and we may break it down.
But why it is necessary to begin it with Rocco Ventura's house?
Because it is outside on the work area.
The ski lift would be being built only there, and according to the plans this last work.
I'll do it i'll tell you why.
That you obtain the first part of the union support.
And a house dismolition will not be expensive.
Not that's right.
So what?
What's that supposed to mean?
It, that as soon as you obtain it the first part of support, you stop the building operations.
You did one like this already.
Yet that tourist centre!
?
- After all, how you believe it?
I will sue you.
- Sue, I wait for it hardly.
I know too much the from your dirty business.
- A yes, Rocco came with us.
- Tell me!
Did we win the trademark?
It is not possible to can yet, but I know that we obtain it.
Listen, very bad news is waiting unfortunately here.
We are there immediately.
We may speak soon.
Hi!
We have to speak.
- I get changed only, and coming.
- We will be waiting.
- First the cheese dairy.
- We leave the house to the last.
- We start with this, and we move downwards.
- So the house?
- Yes, yes.
Cesare, what's going on?
They trusted, how I shall demolish your house.
Since here yet on all of them mine.
Only it signing a contract I signed it.
The contract is loose after two days according to Bortolotti.
We demolish everything as soon as the selling turns up.
Cursed garbages!
Rocco came back!
Do you see it?
He goes towards the city hall.
I'm going.
- What did you say?
- Rocco came back.
He goes to the mayor lord.
Wait.
Wait!
Does not like, that Bortolotti will receive the money, and stops the work.
What is this big shindy?
What is it?
What happens outside?
What is this clamour?
What's going on, Rocco?
You may not demolish my house!
- In fact not anymore yours.
- It I have to sign the contract yet.
And maybe, how I do not do it.
You have to give back the money then for Mr. Bortolotti.
But the fivefold one's.
Because this was the agreement.
Tell, you have so much money?
No.
You have to sign the selling then.
If you do not want it, that Mr. Bortolotti denounce.
But why we quarrel with each other?
!
- Since we know each other for a long time.
- No, Angelo.
- You do not know me.
- Whoo, not i know you.
Says, what do you want?
My goats are found yet.
They give milk, although the corral is ended.
I start making cheese again.
Onto a thousand pieces there is a customer, and it I may pay the punishment.
You delude yourself only, Rocco
- And the suspension is there.
- I arranged that they should withdraw it already.
For you game over, Rocco Ventura!
Game over!
- Let us not inform it Bortolotti?
- Come on.
- He does not forgive.
So what my son?
- Do you have to mention your son steadily?
Comes now the heavy.
How do you made a thousand cheeses under short time like this?
- Since everything was reserved.
- Will succeed.
Listen, we may not win this battle alone.
We need a good lawyer before they continue the fraud longer.
- Not, it only gossip, and I do not believe it.
- I do not believe it.
- Sure.
- You say it, what is with you?
Rocco!
MR. Bortolotti put an offer onto our land, and we accepted it.
An offer was very good, offered even work in the tourist centre.
We sorry, Rocco.
But we do not made cheese.
- And the trademark?
.
- What would change?
The debt remains.
Maybe, that you're right, I understand you.
But I continue then.
I have to organize the work.
Do you help?
Did your university entrance examination succeed?
I knew it!
I'm proud of you!
Yet again?
Yes!
I said that you should stay away from Rocco!
Why you came back?
Don't worry about it!
I am successful alone.
Come on, let's go home!
You should say thanks to Rocco for it rather!
- To thank, what?
- They admitted your son onto the veterinary faculty with a tall score.
Vet?
And why you did not speak about him?
You want your son to work with you
- I wanted to protect him only.
- Rocco protected it: helped it, encouraged it.
See, you should say thanks to Rocco for it.
We owe thanks to him.
What did I know?
That vet?
My son?
Daddy!
Daddy!
Imagine, Rocco may do cheese again, and we help him.
All right.
Look, it would like to be talked over with the mum something.
Go to play in the garden.
Good.
You are clever.
I believe it so, I have the right to know about what happen here.
You're right.
Now it once you're right.
Now it once?
Sure, because I made mistakes always, right?
I stand on the bad side always.
But this was not so earlier.
- Because you were other earlier.
- No.
I am your husband always yet.
I may have a thousand deficiencies, but always I worked for you, that your life should be comfortable.
- Comfortable life?
Is what is essential this according to you?
Since when did you not play with Roberto?
You do not embrace it, you do not talk with him, you not covering it with kisses.
- He needs this, don't you get it?
- Not about him, but about us !
Same thing.
If you make something with him, like that, as if you would make it with me.
He is my son.
The our son.
You knew about the fact that they infected the milk.
And you knew about it, for how important for Roberto Rocco, but you made nothing in order to clear his name.
Nothing.
- Roberto!
- Darling!
I trusted you.
Roberto, I...
All right, but why you want to buy Mr.Ventura's all of goats?
I am looking for a good investment, and I pay immediately.
I see, but we have severe rules regarding the reserved values.
We direct an auction generally.
Why do you not wait for the next auction?
I may not be waiting till then.
I say it in the interest of you.
The goats not like that, than a house or a tillage.
They may be destroyed they may get sick.
How much money would they lose on this?
Do we ask the director of the central?
I'm sorry.
I am sorry that it ended so.
You said what he deserved only.
Rocco!
Hi!
just a short time I came I have to set about work finally.
- Do we start making a cheese?
- With full force throw-in!
Wait for me, i'll be right back.
What happened here?
I think, it is over our marriage.
You do not feel it so now.
You love him always yet.
How could I love a man, who I do not respect already?
I was disappointed in him, Rocco.
And you helped to understand, what is missing.
I just don't want to see.
It's not that simple
The pain confuses the man, and you do not know it already after a time, who are you.
I was other before I got to know Roberto.
And i think, the pain modified your husband.
He was afraid that he loses his son.
You responded well, he no.
You stay be him!
You have to help him!
You did it with your son, do it with your husband!
And you what you feel for me?
I love you.
I want you to be happy because of this.
Oh, we go to work?
What are you waiting for?
- Mom, you come to help?
- Let's go!
Then later, honey.
- Let's go!
- Hi!
- Hi, Roberto!
I lost everything.
My wife and my son.
- I am crazy.
- You?
Rather me.
Come on, this only my fault.
He is a criminal.
- Who, Rocco?
- What Rocco?
Bortolotti.
One single word, which he promised to us, was not true.
Semmi.
Csalás az egész.
Nothing.
Fraud all of it.
- Well stop it then!
- And how?
I lost my credit before the village first.
We organized a huge feast already onto the main square.
He has important contacts.
Sure would ruin me.
You could help.
You are local, you could intercede possibly.
- I don't know, I do not know it really.
- We contrive how we should hurt him.
- Your ideas were so good for you always.
- Thank you.
I know, it is necessary to hurry, but not easy to steal the milk from our own flock.
- What do you want?
- We came in order that we take the animals away.
Somebody bought them from the bank, and sold it to us.
- Will be the auction after months only.
- Will be before according to these.
How do you do.
Pietro Pucco.
Beautiful animals.
Beautiful.
- What kind of harm, that they go onto the slaughterhouse.
- What did you say, onto a slaughterhouse?
Hey, man, for what you are angry at me?
I make my work only.
Be mad at those who sold it to us.
- And who was the salesman?
- Well... a northern man.
Somebody Bor...
Bortolotti.
Bortolotti.
Do you take them onto the slaughterhouse really?
Bizbilio?
Don't worry, tiny!
We untie everything then.
They may not do this.
Said that the mayor lord is already organized everything.
The press conference, the binding of the contracts with the salesmen of the lands.
Ask for anything else?
- Please yet twenty...
- Moment!
Giangreco Delicacy.
Dr. Zagari?
Yes, this is seat of Aspromonte Co-operative.
You say seriously?
And where are you?
Why do I demolish the fence?
They would be broken down anyway, well I do it.
Will be at least less of their work.
Rocco, we won!
The aspromonte cheese was trademark.
I congratulate you.
The on list of protected products response your cheese.
See, succeeded only finally.
Well, I waited more enthusiasm.
- What can I say?
- Bortolotti bought all of the flock.
- How?
- I have to sell out already now.
- Than for the others.
- No, Rocco.
You made so much for me, all of them.
I do not know it in order to say thanks for it.
- This will be on better place at you.
- I did give for you.
I'm fine, and now has to protect you.
- They are flying low today.
- Because they sad.
Will not be their calmness if those many tourists come here then.
You're right, Roberto.
Mayor lord, thank you, that you organized this feast, with which begins officially, a tourist centre's building of the Calidonia.
In the building will be a hotel and restaurants, a new sports-court and a shopping centre that let him fulfil the tourists' every wish.
But you know,will be the real foam on the cake, the elevator what transports the guests into a centre then.
But they do not come into the village!
They exclude us from everything next so.
We yielded many new workplaces.
Please, you stop the unnecessary protest!
Let us think of the future.
Indeed we applaud them, who it was signed the land selling one signing a contract.
Too bad, that I signed it already it signing a contract.
It does not happen to the applause for me.
Sure, you we applaud it doubly.
Since you soon the definitive one sales contract you sign it.
I would speak a little of words before.
The cheese of Calidonia is applied successfully for the title of the protected product.
This means that Europe acknowledged our traditions.
We have the right to preserve them already now.
But our duty to protect.
But too bad, that with this we get nowhere already.
A cheese was being made in the cave is edge of extinction, its fragrance disappears
Its flavour disappears, which reminds of our childhood
And onto our parents' work.
The elevator tourists goes up to the Eagle gable, the eagles fly away somewhere though.
Nobody comes in to us to walk on the main square, let him look at the houses.
Not so once this boy, Roberto, looked down from the Eagle gable onto the village, and said it:
this is our home here.
We sell our lands on the other hand, and we get good money for him.
Nothing will be like that, than once.
All that goes for nothing.
We may spend more money then away, and we may tell less.
What are you doing?
- It is torn up it signing a contract!
- They do it well.
- What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?
Do not let him to cheat you.
Calidonia!
Calidonia...
Mr. Bortolotti!
Show the building contracts and the financial plan.
Prove it, that you not step off with money.
What do you care?
What do you want from me?
I am Calidonia.
We would make sure that you do not stop the work
- after the arrival of the union money.
- But after all that dare?
Swindler!
- Come, we should go away from here.
- For me?
.
- For both.
- Go away, get out!
- Vile swindler!
- What happened?
.
- Only so much, that...
In brief, you notice it immediately.
- Come only in!
- But...
You what are you doing?
Put it here.
Rocco, we talked, and the village decided so, invests money.
I was not worth this.
- We decided so, that we spend the money for you.
You did something for us so much.
Pay it off Bortolotti, recover everything!
- I don't know, what I shall say how.
- Nothing is needed.
Do not leave us only here.
You made it famous Calidonia.
We may be proud of our traditions.
All beauty which can be found here, the eagles, all of them are important.
We, old men forgot this almost already.
Rocco, stay here, do not go away from here!
- What did he say?
- Said that Rocco may live possibly without Calidonia, but Calidonia may not live without Rocco.
See, I understand my son already now, thank you.
- Here you go 150 euros.
- Hey, Ventura!
You get back your 300 cheeses today yet, and here have your three colleagues, who to welcome would wants.
Rocco!
I made my cheese in a cave.
Initially doubted, but thanks for you I have work again duly.
- Thank you, Here you go 1000 euros.
- Thank you.
I say thank you from my heart in my family's name.
We know that you received an important order.
You may count on us.
- We help.
- Thank you.
Bizbilio!
- So we bought back the goats.
- And the sheep.
A little help would be needed now.
Come on!
Bizbilio!
Thank you.
I help.
Thank you.
Daddy!
...993... 994... 995... 996 997... 998... 999... 1 000!
Rocco, Rocco, Rocco...
Roberto healed totally.
Goes back into the school, and makes up the his lag.
- You find it out to do, right?
- It would like to be helped for you rather.
Care about the learning now.
I will be me here when you come back.
- Hi, Rocco!
- Hi!
Thank you.
- All thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Roberto!
You will need this.
To the school.
Daddy, stop!
Rocco!
- I love you!
- I love you very much.
Do never forget this.
- You want some champagne ?
- I'd love some champagne, but I didn't see any at the bar.
This must be your first Mr. Ice party.
It wouldn't be at the bar.
What ?
Beautiful day, and the only way to stay cool is
- How you doin', mama ?
- plenty of ice.
- Hey.
There she is.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Want to get a room ?
Hello ?
I don't even know your name.
I know yours.
Who doesn't ?
Yeah, I made her the baby version of the bling.
You know.
That reminds me.
I think we're gonna have to change that up.
A little more diamonds.
- OMG.
- You could use a glass, but, uh...
No way.
Hey, Mr. Ice, you're the man.
Everybody !
Everybody give me all the stuff right now.
Give me your jewelry !
Take off your jewelry !
I said give me all your stuff !
Take off your jewelry !
This is not a game !
Take it off !
Now !
Wow !
Dakota Hudson.
Give me all your jewelry !
Give me the rocks.
Get'em right now.
Take everything off right now.
You are moving too slow.
we got to get out of here !
Move, let's go.
Come on !
Let's move !
Oh, my God !
Ethan !
Somebody help me !
He's been shot !
We have an armed robbery in progress.
Shots fired.
Possible homicide.
Party was held by one Mr. Ice.
The real name is Bernard Hegland.
- They call him "Jeweler to the A-list."
- Dispatch said two gunmen, Frank.
Yeah.
One fatality gunshot wound.
Ethan Parker.
Sugar.
Family goes back in Florida five generations.
The family history ends here.
Yeah.
Unsubstantiated witness said that one of the guys dropped a nylon mask.
What do we got ?
Oh, my God, it's Dakota.
Look !
It's Dakota.
We got a second fatality, Frank.
These bums get away with diamond trinkets.
But they're not going to get away with murder.
CSI Miami Season 5 Episode 3 "Death Pool 100"
Synchro Dingo Csivore Traduction :
Csivore Cordesh
You want me to put a dollar value on it ?
You put a dollar value on your kids ?
I handcrafted every piece of jewelry my clients were wearing.
Okay, ballpark.
Under or over a million ?
You're clowning, right ?
Try $30 million.
30 million dollars in fancied-up keychains ?
You got to understand quality, shape, heft, clarity.
Nobody hits the red carpet without my stuff.
Well, I can think of two people that won't make that appearance.
I need a detailed description of the jewelry your clients were wearing.
I'll give you the sales list, not the designs.
Those are trademarked.
Okay, fine, Edison, but I need'em by yesterday.
You get a list of stolen merchandise, Frank ?
Ice is compiling it.
Should help us track down our thieves.
We hit the pawnshops and the metal exchanges.
We do it right now.
Yeah, before they unload it and disappear in the Bahamas.
Keep me posted.
Gunshot to the chest.
Still wearing his bling.
Well, he didn't want to give up his jewelry, so he gave up his life.
- Help me out, Ryan, please ?
- Yeah, sure.
What was Dakota Hudson famous for, anyway ?
Lip-syncing, club openings, red carpet events.
She was in the video for that Australian band that was from England.
Oh, basically, she had no talent.
I guess she had talent for being a star.
- Doesn't make sense.
- Tell me about it.
No, she has a... a gunshot wound on her chest.
Tommy Lee wanna be over there said she gave up her jewelry.
Means they had no reason for killing her.
Or they had a reason we didn't know about.
Hey !
Hey !
Put that down.
Hey, look I think I found something big.
Do me a favor.
Put it down.
Somebody said that the robbers were wearing nylon masks.
You're going to contaminate our only DNA link to the guys.
Please put it down.
I photo'd it and measured it.
I learn from my mistakes.
Right.
Great.
Bye.
Let's see who you are, Mr. Masked Man.
Rodrigo Garza.
Wow.
You're even scary without the mask.
I shoot nobody at no Ice party, man.
We can put you at the scene, Rodrigo.
Turns out the mask was more valuable to us than it was to you.
Stick out your hands.
What's-what's that blue mean ?
That means that you shot Ethan Parker, Rodrigo.
Well, I don't...
I didn't know his name, all right ?
All I know is I told him to come up off his stuff, he refused, he tried to get away, so, yo.
Now !
Hey.
What about the Hudson girl Dakota ?
My boy had that side of the party locked down.
What's your buddy's name ?
I get some kind of deal ?
Not in this lifetime, Rodrigo.
Well, I ain't talking, papa.
I beg to differ.
COD is percussive injury to Dakota's heart.
Pulverized it.
Wound tract has macerated.
Do you need some leverage getting that out ?
I shouldn't.
It's not that deep.
It only penetrated a couple of inches.
It's just caught on something.
Well, I'll say
- it mushroomed.
- That's odd.
Penetration was shallow.
It shouldn't have mushroomed.
It had to have hit something before it hit her.
May is see it ?
There's no trace of anything else on the bullet.
You know, it's almost like one of my test-fires in the tank.
The hollow points always mushroom.
'Cause water's denser than air.
It slows down the projectile.
So if the bullet was fired outside of the water, it never would have mushroomed like this.
- You know what that means.
- Dakota's shooter was in the pool.
Exactly.
Thank you, Alexx.
Got a casing.
All the thieves used nines to steal the jewelry
This one's different.
It's a. 380.
Confirms there was a third shooter.
It's starting to look like Dakota's shooting didn't have anything to do with the robbery.
Yeah, well, you can check that on IBIS, right ?
Firing pin impression is as unique as a gun barrel.
- Yes ?
- Miami-Dade PD.
Is your husband home, ma'am ?
Kevin Iverson.
What has he done this time ?
My gun was used to kill someone ?
Yeah.
Any chance you were holding it at the time ?
No.
My gun was stolen a couple months ago.
You file a police report ?
Yes.
I can find you a copy of it.
That's okay.
I'll call and check on it.
Kevin Iverson.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Hey, Frank, take a look at this.
- What is it ?
- This is a death pool list.
Yeah.
Offshore.
Hover Gambling.
It's totally legal, Lieutenant.
Called our family lawyer to make sure.
What in the Sam Hill do you gamble on ?
He is gambling on human lives.
It's a death pool.
I bet on when famous people are going to die.
Henry Kissinger, Abe Vigoda,
Artie Lange,
Don Ho ?
You mean you make picks like a horse race.
Pot's better.
Mine's 100K.
Thanks.
His story checks out.
He reported the gun stolen three months ago.
Told you so.
You made $100,000 when someone shot Dakota Hudson.
I didn't kill her... but it did put my total at 157.
Closest person to me in the pool was at... 149.
On the last day of the pool.
- Couldn't believe my luck.
- Neither can we, Mr. Iverson.
Did a little digging on Hover Gambling.
It's a 50 million dollar a-year business.
All the payments are made in person on the ship.
They get around Florida's ban on gambling by anchoring their ship offshore.
Yeah, three miles offshore.
Behind that line, gambling is 100% legit.
And beyond our jurisdiction.
And that's their ship.
"The FortuneMaker."
You got to wonder what else they're betting on for 50 million.
Who gets the big paycheck over at Hover Gambling ?
His identity is a well-kept secret, Frank.
- I say we bust on the boat and ask.
- We can't board the vessel.
They haven't broken a law.
Wouldn't hurt to have a look-see.
It's already in motion.
Are you serious ?
A death pool party ?
Well, it's the same old group, just a new death pool, and it turns out Iverson wasn't the only person to pick Dakota Hudson.
This is the list H got at Iverson's.
Lamar.
Lamar picked Dakota.
She also had motive.
Okay, so these people bet at sea and then they meet on shore ?
Most of them to research their picks, to handicap, it's a... social thing.
- You think Lamar will be there ?
- I don't know, but it's worth a shot.
Okay, okay, let's get started.
Take your seat please.
Thank you.
For you new people, you get to pick seven names for your death list.
List goes six months from midnight tonight.
Each pick begins at 100 points.
If your guy is 80 years old when he dies, you subtract his age, 80, from 100 to get 20.
You get 20 points for that pick.
You're going to make your picks and your points in long shots.
Floor's open.
I'll start, let me start, let me start.
You guys know Alina Barranco, the opera singer ?
Friend at the Manhattan ER says she has lung cancer.
Lung cancer ?
Good.
- That and her weight she's a sure thing.
- Yeah, in six months, though ?
I've got relatives who've hung in for years with lung cancer.
Then don't pick her.
More for me when I win.
Yeah, okay, listen.
The groundskeeper at the university said Spencer Mason got sacked so bad at practice, he may have to quit the team.
Concussion or just a contusion ?
All right, I heard Michael Ware let his fall show tank because he's back on heroin.
Is he mainlining or just smoking ?
The needle.
He won't last two months.
Oh, hey, I heard Dakota Hudson sustained a gunshot wound to the torso this morning.
You can't pick her.
She's dead.
Yeah, we know that.
She was my long shot last time.
So you must be Lamar.
Rebecca Lamar.
You're going to need to come with us.
Mommy ?
I'm going to need to bring my son.
Won't be a problem.
Do you know Kevin Iverson ?
Yeah, he's a death pooler.
I know him from the parties.
Is there any chance you borrowed his gun ?
He told us his gun was stolen.
We're looking into the stolen gun report.
However, you and Kevin were the only ones who stood to benefit from Dakota's death.
Wait, you think...
- I didn't shoot anyone.
- She was young, healthy, 25 years old, that's worth 75 points.
Too healthy for a death pooler.
I traded her a month ago when she checked herself into rehab.
To whom ?
To Todd 321.
Was Todd 321 at the death pool party ?
No.
He's paranoid.
He thinks we're all going to steal his picks.
Will you write down any information
- you may have about him ?
- Sure.
Do you know when my mom will be finished ?
It shouldn't take that much longer.
- What's your name ?
- Tyler.
Tyler.
That's a cool name.
Is my mom in trouble for not paying bills again ?
Partner, right now, we're just....
asking her some questions, but here's what I want you to do.
If you need my help, anything at all, I want you to call that number, okay, and I'll be there.
Okay, thanks.
I'm gonna keep this.
- You ready, Tyler ?
- Yes, Mom.
Ma'am, your son is very concerned about you.
I love him very much.
Come on, let's go.
See you, Tyler.
Can we ride water bikes ?
We'll see.
Let's not miss the bus.
What do you think ?
She checks out.
She gave us information on a Todd.
She traded him Dakota Hudson in the death pool.
Here's the address.
She's all yours.
Take care of her.
- Hey, Todd.
- Too late, I just sold it.
Todd Baransky ?
I guess you're not making enough on the death pool, huh, Todd ?
Oh, man, I should have stuck to weather.
Weather ?
- You mean rain, sleet ?
- Yeah.
I was on a roll, man.
I called four flash storms in a row.
Highest recorded temperature of September.
Lowest humidity in the panhandle.
Okay ?
Then.... my luck changed a little.
Till you found a winner with Dakota Hudson, right ?
Dakota was shot this morning.
No, I ended up eight points short.
Yes, to Kevin Iverson;
we know about it.
Man, I needed that win.
That's why I sold my car back payment.
Yes, to Hover Gambling.
Yeah.
I got a little behind, big deal.
Guy sprained my wrist !
He threw my head up against the wall !
I spent the night in the hospital !
I didn't get out till after lunch today !
How long have you been gambling with Hover ?
Three years.
One by one, I've seen it all go, man.
The dental practice, house, car.
Todd, let us help you.
How ?
Offshore betting is legal.
Yes, but assault and battery aren't.
His name is Shin.
I don't know if it's a first or last name, but... he hangs out at the bar at the National.
That's a good start.
Mr. Shin ?
Should I know you ?
You do now.
Last night, you beat somebody over a gambling debt.
His name is Todd Baransky.
Does that ring a bell ?
He fell, I helped him up.
How many times ?
Stand up.
- Knuckle duster.
- Mr. Shin, if I find Todd Baransky's DNA on that, you're going to prison for ten years.
The Tekko is for protection.
I do promotions for Hover Gambling.
Promotions ?
We give incentives to hotels and restaurants to encourage tourists to visit our gambling ships.
In Texas, we call that a bribe.
Look at that.
Well, there you go.
Is that for promotions, Mr. Shin ?
Gotta spend money to make money.
Probably print it in your cousin's garage.
However,
I hate to say this, but this looks perfect.
Maybe too perfect.
Hook him up, Frank.
Thank you, Mr. Shin.
I'll make bail in an hour.
Calleigh.
I believe you have a phone number I need.
We need to call the Treasury.
You think these bills are authentic ?
I think so.
Paper is three-quarters cotton, one-quarter linen.
There's watermark, color-shifting ink, and security strips.
Right on all counts.
They're even made by an Intaglio press, but...
But what ?
- They're counterfeit.
- I don't understand.
I thought that...
Intaglio presses were only available to governments.
They are, which tells me, Calleigh, this is a supernote.
Good enough to undermine an entire economy.
What makes it a supernote ?
The ink on a supernote lies flat on the currency while on a genuine note, the ink is slightly raised.
The plates they use for a supernote leave a slightly sharper edge than on the genuine one.
It's especially obvious on the hands of the clock tower.
Can you see that ?
I guess.
I don't know.
I think I just can't see it.
All right, the easiest way is if you compare bills.
- I only have 20s.
- You got a hundred on you ?
Yeah, I brought one just in case.
Okay, so...
Calleigh, this is a supernote, too.
What ?
The hands on the clock are pristine.
Really ?
Either their fake currency has already been introduced into the local economy, or you're betting with Hover Gambling.
I'm going to have to seize this.
Of course.
Yeah, excuse me.
I'm going to need to find Horatio.
You remember that iPod I picked up for your niece ?
Oh, yeah.
When I was doing my extended shifts last week.
I meant to thank you for that.
Then hundred dollar bill you paid me back with, it was counterfeit.
What ?
Not only is it counterfeit, it's a supernote.
Peter Elliot has it and he's sending it to his bosses in Washington.
You play the death pool ?
Yeah, once.
I should have known, the way you talked about it, your familiarity with the handicap system.
I gave some money to my friend, he placed a bet.
It was Lou Rawls on January six, and...
I don't know, it was a total fluke it paid out.
Do you realize what you've done ?
Let's see, it's off-shore, so it's legal.
The payouts aren't.
- Hover Gambling is dirty.
- All right, you know what ?
- I'll deal with Peter myself.
- No !
It's done.
You know what ?
I don't need you to take the heat for me on this.
If this goes any deeper into this lab, there's going to be a full-blown investigation, we will lose our accreditation.
The buck stops with me.
You got it ?
Yeah, I got it.
Attention, FortuneMaker, prepare to be boarded.
Welcome.
Miami-Dade Police Department.
You've got quite an operation here.
I'm just providing a first-class venue for people to do what they're going to do anyway.
Gambling is America's new pastime.
You must be thrilled about that.
I'd like to take a look around.
I'll give you a personal tour.
This is our main hall.
It's not just about gambling.
It's about entertaining.
Not only do we have no-limit wages, but our service is no-limit.
And gambling is truly a victimless crime.
Dakota Hudson's family may feel differently, Mr. Choi.
- Death is the ultimate gamble.
- Yes, but in this case, no matter who dies, the house wins, doesn't it ?
We don't control the names on the death pool.
- We're only responsible for the payout.
- Okay
Your payouts are counterfeit, and you're making the bills aboard this ship.
Those fake hundreds have diesel fuel on them.
My lab confirmed it.
You're out of your jurisdiction.
But you know this.
I don't have to show you anything.
Then I'm here as a guest.
Hey, Frank.
Have you had any leads on the second thief's name ?
- Oh, sorry.
- Zip.
Any leads on the jewelry ?
Pawn shops, estate sales.
You know, if the second guy unloaded the jewelry...
You know what ?
I'm talking to a diamond broker.
Yeah.
No ?
All right, thanks for your trouble.
Jewels aren't being fenced anywhere, at least locally.
It doesn't make any sense to me a guy would drive a trunk-load full of jewelry outside of Miami and risk getting arrested by a Statie.
This is got...
What did I miss ?
Take a look at Dakota's earlobe, the inflammation.
Witnesses said the thief ripped out her earrings.
I don't think that's what caused this red, swollen area.
I think it's infected.
You know, I had this same problem back in college.
From what ?
Cheap jewelry.
That Ethan's jewelry ?
It's the only jewelry we collected,'cause this is the only one who wouldn't give it up.
Chain, watch, cell phone, all valued at a quarter million dollars.
All right.
Testing mineral fracture toughness ?
How many mega-pascals do you want to start with ?
diamond's ten on the Mohs'scale.
You want to try seven ?
Sure.
Busted at seven.
It's glass.
Well, lookie there.
It's no wonder nobody's hocking Mr. Ice's wares.
They're fake.
Well, I'm going to get Ryan and pay Mr. Ice a visit.
Miami-Dade PD !
Don't move !
Don't move !
- Don't move !
- Let me see the hands.
Let me see the hands.
Go.
Don't move !
Pretty creative way to destroy evidence.
Did you know that you need a permit to use a woodchipper near the water ?
You arresting me for that ?
No, grand theft and fraud.
A lot of rich people are going to want to see you in prison.
I didn't start out using glass stones.
I just realized I could make bigger money using fakes.
You had to figure someone was going to find out eventually.
A secret like that can't last forever.
I decided to throw a party, invite all my customers.
I knew they'd wear my jewelry.
Right and you got this thug and his little pal Garza to show up, take all the jewelry ?
You figured the rich people would file insurance claims.
They'd get their money back.
I remain "Jeweler to the A-list."
Go back to using real bling.
So then why'd your guys kill Ethan Parker ?
That was them, not me.
- Liar !
- Hey, hey !
- All I wanted was a simple heist.
- Hey, man, he told me and Garza to cap that kid.
Just Garza got to him first.
- He's fronting.
- Put him in the car !
What if I told you that your little rich kid client, Ethan, figured out that the jewelry you sold him was fake ?
These aren't real diamonds.
You're a fraud.
- Who else knows besides you ?
- No one yet, but I've got a big mouth.
- You'd better shut up.
- I don't think you can make me shut up.
I do.
So you had him killed.
Get him to MDPD.
You're both going down.
Excuse me.
That stain on your hand ?
You know, Lieutenant, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Don't bother, Mr. Choi.
I got what I came for.
Lieutenant Caine.
You're poking around my jurisdiction now ?
I guess that means that you're investigating
Hover Gambling, as well, Agent Cole.
We're keeping a close watch on The FortuneMaker.
Are you aware that they're manufacturing bogus currency aboard that ship ?
I just met a man, Agent Cole, that had a very curious ink stain on his hands.
That could get you a warrant if you chose.
We know all about the supernotes.
You know about the notes ?
Lee Choi works for the North Korean government.
Of course, he does.
That's how he got the press.
But... we don't want to arrest him for the money.
Who are you planning to arrest ?
We are trying to get to their top government officials for that and more.
Selling missile technology, illegal weapons sales to our enemies.
Phony currency could collapse the economy of Miami, Agent Cole.
- We're not going to let it get that bad.
- Neither do I.
Hey, Cooper ?
I thought you were working the Ice party case with us.
I am.
Just showing a little initiative.
Oh, fantastic.
What have you got ?
We know for certain that Dakota Hudson was shot with Kevin Iverson's gun, right ?
Yeah, Tripp just found it three blocks from the crime scene.
That might explain this.
I pulled that case file.
Turns out the detective on the burglary saved the 911 tape.
- I'm listening.
- Good.
Listen to this.
911 Operator.
- What is your emergency ?
- Someone broke into my house.
They took my TV and gun.
Yeah, that is odd.
As Tripp would say, it's hinky.
I can him missing his television right away, but his gun ?
He's lying.
I'm going to take a look at that gun.
I'm going to give you credit.
Thank you.
When cops find the murder weapon three blocks from the crime scene, they want results.
You know, Frank, it is not going to help the case if I do a sloppy job.
Well, I mean...
how hard is it ?
Just test fire Iverson's gun and compare the rounds.
I am getting into it.
Hey, you know what ?
I think there's some fabric caught in the slide.
Let me see.
Agostina.
Iverson's wife's a fan.
You know, your knowledge of the fashion world, it's-it's impressive.
Do you have something you want to tell me ?
What ?
It's my ex-wife's favorite designer.
She put me in hock with that stuff.
Okay.
If that's your story.
So... tell me how fast you can get Mrs. Iverson here.
The gun dealer ID'd your photo.
You bought your husband's gun back.
His father gave it to him.
He loved that gun.
You went to the Ice party to shoot Dakota.
It was the last day of the death pool, and I guess you figured with her stint in rehab, it'd be an easy opportunity to put one in the win column for your husband.
Can you prove that ?
Yes.
We're executing a search warrant on your house as we speak to look for this.
It's a match of the Agostina dress you were wearing.
It caught in the gun slide as you shot Dakota.
There's gotta be hundreds of dresses
- that look like that.
- No, you were the only one with the gun and the dress.
Katrina, we got you.
Kevin...
Kevin finally got his big win so we could start fresh.
All I want is a fresh start.
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
This is Horatio Caine.
I'm sorry, I can't...
Tyler ?
Tyler !
Tyler, where are you ?
Tyler ?
Rebecca.
Rebecca, where's Tyler ?
You were supposed to bring him.
- He's with a babysitter.
- He's not with a babysitter.
Where is he ?
- He's fine.
- Rebecca, where is he ?
I owed some money, and I used him as collateral.
- So you sold him.
- No, they're just holding on to him.
I'm going to win him back.
Who did you sell him to ?
A pony-tailed guy who works for Mr. Choi.
You make me sick.
Agent Cole.
Horatio Caine.
I'm looking for your phone taps on the gambling ship, a specific number.
- Give it to me.
- Right.
The number is 305-555-0133.
I'm checking.
They called that number from the ship's office a half-hour ago.
Who's number is it ?
It's mine.
FortuneMaker, this is the US Coast Guard.
Prepare to be boarded.
Where's my mom ?
You shut up.
Mr. Choi ?
That'll be enough.
I'm closing you down.
You have no right to do this.
Everything on this ship is legal.
Everything but the boy.
Now stand up, turn around and put your hands on your head right now.
Do it.
- Gentlemen.
- US Coast Guard.
You're under arrest for false imprisonment and kidnapping of a minor.
You okay, son ?
I knew you'd find me.
I wasn't going to leave you, Tyler.
Come on.
We found over a million dollars in supernotes, so far.
Printing press is gone.
Don't worry, Agent Cole, it's going to turn up.
Just so it's not in Miami, right ?
Not if they're smart.
Agent Cole ?
Take care.
Tyler ?
I love you, baby.
Mommy ?
People gambling their lives away and getting paid in fake hundreds.
Yeah, well, I hope we never see them again.
Yeah, well, me, too.
So, just how good were those bills ?
More real than you can imagine.
I guess somebody will always think it's easy to make a hundred.
But we... we know different, don't we ?
(music playing)
You want some champagne?
I'd love some champagne, but I didn't see any at the bar.
This must be your first Mr. Ice party.
It wouldn't be at the bar.
What?
Beautiful day, and the only way to stay cool is--
How you doin', mama?
-- plenty of ice.
Hi.
There she is.
Mm, thank you.
Want to get a room?
Hello?
I don't even know your name.
I know yours.
Who doesn't?
Yeah, I made her the baby version of the bling.
That reminds me.
I think we're gonna have to change that up.
A little more diamonds.
(indistinct conversations)
OMG.
You could use a glass, but, uh...
No way.
Hey, Mr. Ice, you're the man.
(gunshot)
(gunshots and screaming)
MAN:
Back up!
Back up!
(people shouting)
Give me your jewelry!
Take off your jewelry!
(gunshot, screaming)
I said give me all your stuff!
Give me everything!
Take off your jewelry!
(gunshots)
This is no game!
Take it off!
Now!
You think I'm playing with you?
Wow!
Dakota Hudson.
Give me all your jewelry!
Give me the rocks.
Get 'em right now.
You can have 'em.
Take everything off right now.
You are moving too slow.
(gunshot, groan)
Hey, man, we got to get out of here!
(man shouting)
Move out!
Everybody stay...
stay down!
(gunshots)
Let's move, let's go.
Come on!
(crying):
Oh, my God!
(gunshots continue)
Somebody help me!
He's been shot!
(tires squealing)
(sirens wailing)
MAN (over radio):
We have an armed robbery in progress.
Shots fired.
Possible homicide.
TRIPP:
Party was held by one Mr. Ice.
The real name is, uh, Bernard Hegland.
They call him "Jeweler to the A-list."
Dispatch said two gunmen, Frank.
Yeah.
One fatality-- gunshot wound.
Ethan Parker.
Sugar.
Family goes back in Florida five generations.
The family history ends here.
Yeah.
Unsubstantiated witness said that, uh, one of the guys dropped a nylon mask.
(woman shrieks)
What do we got?
MAN:
Oh, my God, it's Dakota.
WOMAN:
Oh, my God!
Oh, it's Dakota.
We got a second fatality, Frank.
These bums get away with diamond trinkets.
But they're not going to get away with murder. sync:knlight
(garbled radio transmission)
You want me to put a dollar value on it?
You put a dollar value on your kids?
I handcrafted every piece of jewelry my clients were wearing.
Okay, ballpark.
Under or over a million?
You're clowning, right?
Try $30 million.
$30 million in fancied-up keychains?
You got to understand quality, shape, heft, clarity.
Nobody hits the red carpet without my stuff.
Well, I can think of two people that won't make that appearance.
Now, I need a detailed description of the jewelry your clients were wearing.
I'll give you the sales list, not the designs.
Those are trademarked.
Okay, fine, Edison, but I need 'em by yesterday.
You get a list of stolen merchandise, Frank?
TRIPP:
Ice is compiling it.
Should help us track down our thieves.
Okay, we hit the pawnshops and the metal exchanges.
We do it right now.
Yeah, before they unload it and disappear in the Bahamas.
Keep me posted.
Hey.
Gunshot to the chest.
Still wearing his bling.
Well, he didn't want to give up his jewelry, so he gave up his life.
-Help me out, Ryan, please?
-Yeah.
(grunts)
(camera shutter clicking)
What was Dakota Hudson famous for, anyway?
Lip-syncing, club openings, red carpet events.
Oh, she was in the video for that Australian band that was from England.
Oh, basically, she had no talent.
I guess she had talent for being a star.
Doesn't make sense.
Tell me about it.
No, she has a-a gunshot wound on her chest.
Tommy Lee wannabe over there said she gave up her jewelry.
Means they had no reason for killing her.
Or they had a reason we didn't know about.
WOLFE:
Hey!
WOLFE (whistles):
Hey!
Put that down.
Hey, look-
- I think I found something big.
Do me a favor.
Put it down.
Well, somebody said that the robbers were wearing nylon masks.
You're going to contaminate our only DNA link to the guys.
Please put it down.
I photo'd it and measured it.
Oh.
I learn from my mistakes.
Right.
(clears throat)
(garbled radio transmission)
Great.
Bye.
Let's see who you are, Mr. Masked Man.
(computer trilling and beeping)
Rodrigo Garza.
Wow.
You're even scary without the mask.
I shoot nobody at no Ice party, man.
We can put you at the scene, Rodrigo.
(people screaming)
Turns out the mask was more valuable to us than it was to you.
Stick out your hands.
What's-what's that blue mean?
That means that you shot Ethan Parker, Rodrigo.
Well, I don't...
I didn't know his name, all right?
All I know is I told him to come up off his stuff, he refused, he tried to get away, so, yo.
Now!
Hey.
(groans)
What about the Hudson girl-
- Dakota?
My boy had that side of the party locked down.
What's your buddy's name?
I get some kind of deal?
Not in this lifetime, Rodrigo.
Well, I ain't talking, papa.
I beg to differ.
WOODS:
COD is percussive injury to Dakota's heart-- pulverized it.
Wound tract is macerated.
-Do you need some leverage getting that out?
-I shouldn't.
It's not that deep.
It only penetrated a couple of inches.
It's just caught on something.
Well, I'll say.
It mushroomed.
WOODS:
That's odd.
Penetration was shallow.
It shouldn't have mushroomed.
Uh-uh.
It had to have hit something before it hit her.
May is see it?
There's no trace of anything else on the bullet.
You know, it's almost like one of my test-fires in the tank.
The hollow points always mushroom.
'Cause water's denser than air.
It slows down the projectile.
So if the bullet was fired outside of the water, it never would have mushroomed like this.
You know what that means.
Dakota's shooter was in the pool.
(groans)
Exactly.
Thank you, Alexx.
Got a casing.
All the thieves used nines to steal the jewelry but this one's different.
It's a .380.
DUQUESNE:
Confirms there was a third shooter.
It's starting to look like Dakota's shooting didn't have anything to do with the robbery.
Yeah, well, you can check that on IBIS, right?
Firing pin impression is as unique as a gun barrel.
(beeping)
(rapid beeping)
(gunshot)
Yes?
TRIPP:
Miami-Dade PD.
Is your husband home, ma'am?
'
Kevin Iverson.
What has he done this time?
My gun was used to kill someone?
Yeah.
Any chance you were holding it at the time?
No.
My gun was stolen a couple months ago.
You file a police report?
Yes.
I can find you a copy of it.
That's okay.
I'll call and check on it.
Kevin Iverson.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Hey, Frank, take a look at this.
What is it?
This is a death pool list.
Yeah.
Offshore.
Hover Gambling.
It's totally legal, Lieutenant.
Called our family lawyer to make sure.
What in the Sam Hill do you gamble on?
He is gambling on human lives.
It's a death pool.
I bet on when famous people are going to die.
Henry Kissinger,
Abe Vigoda, Artie Lange,
Don Ho?
You mean you make picks like a horse race.
Pot's better.
Mine's 100K.
Thanks.
His story checks out.
He reported the gun stolen three months ago.
Told you so.
You made $100,000 when someone shot
Dakota Hudson.
I didn't kill her... but it did put my total at 157.
Closest person to me in the pool was at, uh, 149.
(laughs):
On the last day of the pool.
Couldn't believe my luck.
Neither can we, Mr. Iverson.
TRIPP:
Did a little digging on Hover Gambling.
It's a $50 million- a-year business.
All the payments are made in person on the ship.
They get around Florida's ban on gambling by anchoring their ship offshore.
TRIPP:
Yeah, three miles offshore.
Behind that line, gambling is 100% legit.
And beyond our jurisdiction.
And that's their ship.
The FortuneMaker.
You got to wonder what else they're betting on for 50 million.
Who gets the big paycheck over at Hover Gambling?
His identity is a well-kept secret, Frank.
I say we bust on the boat and ask.
We can't board the vessel.
They haven't broken a law.
Wouldn't hurt to have a look-see.
It's already in motion.
(music playing)
(indistinct chatter)
DUQUESNE:
Are you serious?
A death pool party?
Well, it's the same old group, just a new death pool, and it turns out
Iverson wasn't the only person to pick Dakota Hudson.
This is the list H got at Iverson's.
Lamar.
Lamar picked Dakota.
They also had motive.
Okay, so these people bet at sea and then they meet on shore?
Most of them to research their picks, to handicap, it's, um--
It's a social thing.
You think Lamar will be there?
I don't know, but it's worth a shot.
Okay, okay, let's get started.
Take your seat please.
Thank you.
For you new people, you get to pick seven names for your death list.
List goes six months from midnight tonight.
Each pick begins at 100 points.
If your guy is 80 years old when he dies, you subtract his age, 80, from 100 to get 20.
You get 20 points for that pick.
You're going to make your picks and your points in long shots.
Floor's open.
I'll start, let me start, let me start.
You guys know Alina Barranco the opera singer?
Friend at the Manhattan ER says she has lung cancer.
Lung cancer?
Good.
That and her weight-- she's a sure thing.
Yeah, in six months, though?
I've got relatives who've hung in for years with lung cancer.
Then don't pick her.
More for me when I win.
Yeah, okay, listen.
The groundskeeper at the university said Spencer Mason got sacked so bad at practice, he may have to quit the team.
Concussion or just a contusion?
I'm still working on that.
All right, I heard Michael Ware let his fall show tank because he's back on heroin.
MAN:
Is he mainlining or just smoking?
The needle.
He won't last two months.
Oh, hey, I heard Dakota Hudson sustained a gunshot wound to the torso this morning.
You can't pick her.
She's dead.
Yeah, we know that.
She was my long shot last time.
So you must be Lamar.
Rebecca Lamar.
You're going to need to come with us.
Mommy?
I'm going to need to bring my son.
Won't be a problem.
DUQUESNE:
Do you know Kevin Iverson?
Yeah, he's a death pooler.
I know him from the parties.
Is there any chance you borrowed his gun?
He told us his gun was stolen.
We're looking into the stolen gun report.
However, you and Kevin were the only ones who stood to benefit from Dakota's death.
Wait, you think--
I didn't shoot anyone.
She was young, healthy, 25 years old; that's worth 75 points.
Too healthy for a death pooler.
I traded her a month ago when she checked herself into rehab.
To whom?
To Todd 321.
Was Todd 321 at the death pool party?
No.
He's paranoid.
He thinks we're all going to steal his picks.
DUQUESNE:
Will you write down any information you may have about him?
Sure.
Do you know when my mom will be finished?
It shouldn't take that much longer.
What's your name?
-Tyler.
-Tyler.
That's a cool name.
Is my mom in trouble for not paying bills again?
Partner, right now, we're just asking her some questions, but here's what I want you to do.
If you need my help, anything at all, I want you to call that number, okay, and I'll be there.
Okay, thanks.
All right.
I'm going to keep this.
REBECCA:
You ready, Tyler?
Yes, Mom.
Ma'am, your son is very concerned about you.
I love him very much.
Come on, let's go.
See you, Tyler.
Can we ride water bikes?
REBECCA:
We'll see;
let's not miss the bus.
What do you think?
She checks out.
She gave us information on a Todd.
She traded him Dakota Hudson in the death pool.
Here's the address.
MAN:
She's all yours.
Take care of her.
CAINE:
Hey, Todd.
Too late, I just sold it.
Todd Baransky?
I guess you're not making enough on the death pool, huh, Todd?
Oh, man, I should have stuck to weather.
TRIPP:
Weather?
-You mean rain, sleet?
-Yeah.
I was on a roll, man.
I called four flash storms in a row.
Highest recorded temperature of September.
Lowest humidity in the panhandle.
Okay?
Then, my luck changed a little.
Till you found a winner with Dakota Hudson, right?
Dakota was shot this morning.
No, I ended up eight points short.
Yes, to Kevin Iverson;
we know about it.
Man, I needed that win.
That's why I sold my car-- back payment.
Yes, to Hover Gambling.
Yeah.
I got a little behind, big deal.
Guy sprained my wrist!
He threw my head up against the wall!
I spent the night in the hospital!
I didn't get out till after lunch today!
How long have you been gambling with Hover?
Three years.
One by one, I've seen it all go, man.
The dental practice, house, car.
Todd, let us help you.
How?
Offshore betting is legal.
Yes, but assault and battery aren't.
His name is Shin.
I don't know if it's a first or last name, but... he hangs out at the bar at the National.
That's a good start.
Mr. Shin?
Should I know you?
You do now.
Last night, you beat somebody over a gambling debt.
His name is Todd Baransky.
Does that ring a bell?
He fell, I helped him up.
How many times?
Stand up.
Uh-huh.
Knuckle duster.
Mr. Shin, if I find Todd Baransky's DNA on that, you're going to prison for ten years.
The Tekko is for protection.
I do promotions for Hover Gambling.
Promotions?
We give incentives to hotels and restaurants to encourage tourists to visit our gambling ships.
In Texas, we call that a bribe.
Look at that.
Well, there you go.
Is that for promotions, Mr. Shin?
Gotta spend money to make money.
Probably print it in your cousin's garage.
However,
I hate to say this, but this looks perfect.
Maybe too perfect.
Hook him up, Frank.
Thank you, Mr. Shin.
I'll make bail in an hour.
Calleigh.
I believe you have a phone number I need.
Contact the Treasury.
You think these bills are authentic?
I think so.
Paper is three-quarters cotton, one-quarter linen.
There's watermark, color-shifting ink, and security strips.
Right on all counts.
They're even made by an Intaglio press, but...
Mm-hmm.
But what?
They're counterfeit.
I don't understand.
I thought that Intaglio presses were only available to governments.
They are, which tells me, Calleigh, this is a supernote.
Good enough to undermine an entire economy.
So what makes it a supernote?
The ink on a supernote lies flat on the currency while on a genuine note the ink is slightly raised.
The plates they use for a supernote leave a slightly sharper edge then on the genuine one.
It's especially obvious on the hands of the clock tower.
Can you see that?
I guess.
I don't know.
I think I just can't see it.
All right, the easiest way is if you compare bills.
Uh, I only have 20s.
You got a hundred on you?
Uh, yeah, I brought one just in case.
Great.
Okay, so...
Calleigh, this is a supernote, too.
What?
The hands on the clock are pristine.
Really?
Either their fake currency has already been introduced into the local economy, or you're betting with Hover Gambling.
I'm going to have to seize this.
Of course.
Excuse me.
I'm going to need to find Horatio.
Hey.
Hey.
You remember that iPod I picked up for your niece?
Oh, yeah.
When I was doing my extended shifts last week.
I meant to thank you for that.
Then hundred dollar bill you paid me back with, it was counterfeit.
What?
Not only is it counterfeit, it's a supernote.
Peter Elliot has it and he's sending it to his bosses in Washington.
You play the death pool?
Yeah, once.
I should have known, the way you talked about it, your familiarity with the handicap system.
I gave some money to my friend, he placed a bet.
It was Lou Rawls on January six, and, uh...
I don't know, it was a total fluke-- it paid out.
Do you realize what you've done?
Well, let's see, it's off-shore, so it's legal.
The payouts aren't.
Hover Gambling is dirty.
All right, you know what?
I'll deal with Peter myself.
No!
It's done.
You know what?
I don't need you to take the heat for me on this.
If this goes any deeper into this lab, there's going to be a full-blown investigation, we will lose our accreditation.
The buck stops with me-- have you got it?
Yeah, I got it.
(siren blaring)
MAN (over megaphone):
Attention, FortuneMaker, prepare to be boarded.
Welcome.
Miami-Dade Police Department.
DELKO:
That's right.
You've got quite an operation here.
I'm just providing a first-class venue for people to do what they're going to do anyway.
Gambling is America's new pastime.
You must be thrilled about that.
I'd like to take a look around.
I'll give you a personal tour.
(machines playing playful tones)
HOST:
This is our main hall.
It's not just about gambling.
It's about entertaining.
Not only do we have no-limit wages, but our service is no-limit.
And gambling is truly a victimless crime.
Dakota Hudson's family may feel differently, Mr. Choi.
But death is the ultimate gamble.
Yes, but in this case, no matter who dies, the house wins, doesn't it?
Well, we don't control the names on the death pool.
We're only responsible for the payout.
Okay.
Your payouts are counterfeit, and you're making the bills aboard this ship.
Those fake hundreds have diesel fuel on them.
My lab ran it.
(chuckling):
You're out of your jurisdiction.
But you know this.
I don't have to show you anything.
Then I'm here as a guest.
Hey, Frank.
Have you had any leads on the second thief's name?
-Oh, sorry.
-Zip.
Any leads on the jewelry?
Pawn shops, estate sales.
You know, if the second guy unloaded the jewelry...
You know what?
I'm talking to a diamond broker.
Yeah.
No?
All right, thanks for your trouble.
Jewels aren't being fenced anywhere, at least locally.
You know, it doesn't make any sense to me a guy would drive a trunk-load full of jewelry outside of Miami and risk getting arrested by a Statie.
It's got...
What did I miss?
Take a look at Dakota's earlobe, the inflammation.
Witnesses said the thief ripped out her earrings.
I don't think that's what caused this red, swollen area-- I think it's infected.
You know, I had this same problem back in college.
From what?
Cheap jewelry.
That Ethan's jewelry?
It's the only jewelry we collected, 'cause the the only one who wouldn't give it up.
Chain, watch, cell phone, all valued at a quarter million dollars.
All right.
Testing mineral fracture toughness?
How many mega-pascals do you want to start with?
Well... diamond's ten on the Mohs' scale.
You want to try seven?
Sure.
(beeping)
(beeping)
Busted at seven;
it's glass.
Well, lookie there.
It's no wonder nobody's hocking Mr. Ice's wares.
They're fake.
Well, I'm going to get Ryan and pay Mr. Ice a visit.
(grinding noise nearby)
Miami-Dade PD!
DELKO:
Don't move!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Let me see the hands.
Let me see the hands.
OFFICER:
Don't move!
(chuckles lightly)
Pretty creative way to destroy evidence.
Did you know that you need a permit to use a woodchipper near the water?
You arresting me for that?
No, grand theft and fraud.
A lot of rich people are going to want to see you in prison.
I didn't start out using glass stones.
I just realized I could make bigger money using fakes.
You had to figure someone was going to find out eventually.
A secret like that can't last forever.
I decided to throw a party, invite all my customers.
I knew they'd wear my jewelry.
Right and you got this thug and his little pal Garza to show up, take all the jewelry?
You figured the rich people would file insurance claims.
They'd get their money back.
I remain "Jeweler to the A-list."
Go back to using real bling.
WOLFE:
So then why'd your guys kill Ethan Parker?
That was them, not me.
Liar!
Hey, hey!
All I wanted was a simple heist.
Hey, man, he told me and Garza to cap that kid.
Just Garza got to him first.
He's fronting.
Get off me!
DELKO:
Put him in the car!
What if I told you that your little rich kid client, Ethan, figured out that the jewelry you sold him was fake?
These aren't real diamonds-- you're a fraud.
Who else knows besides you?
No one yet, but I've got a big mouth.
You'd better shut up.
I don't think you can make me shut up.
I do.
WOLFE:
So you had him killed.
Get him to MDPD.
You're both going down.
Excuse me.
That stain on your hand?
(glass shattering)
You know, Lieutenant, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Don't bother, Mr. Choi.
I got what I came for.
Lieutenant Caine.
You're poking around my jurisdiction now?
I guess that means that you're investigating
Hover Gambling, as well, Agent Cole.
We're keeping a close watch on The FortuneMaker.
Are you aware that they're manufacturing bogus currency aboard that ship?
I just met a man, Agent Cole, that had a very curious ink stain on his hands.
That could get you a warrant if you chose.
We know all about the supernotes.
You know about the notes?
Lee Choi works for the North Korean government.
Of course, he does.
That's how he got the press.
But we don't want to arrest him for the money.
Who are you planning to arrest?
We are trying to get to their top government officials for that and more.
Selling missile technology, illegal weapons sales to our enemies.
Phony currency could collapse the economy of Miami, Agent Cole.
(scoffs):
We're not going to let it get that bad.
Neither do I
Hey, Cooper?
I thought you were working the Ice party case with us.
I am.
Just showing a little initiative.
Oh, fantastic.
What have you got?
We know for certain that Dakota Hudson was shot with Kevin Iverson's gun, right?
Yeah, Tripp just found it three blocks from the crime scene.
That might explain this.
I pulled that case file.
Turns out the detective on the burglary saved the 911 tape.
I'm listening.
Good.
Listen to this.
911 Operator.
What is your emergency?
IVERSON:
Uh, uh, someone broke into my house.
They took my TV and gun.
Yeah, that is odd.
As Tripp would say, it's hinky.
I can him missing his television right away, but his gun?
He's lying.
I'm going to take a look at that gun.
I'm going to give you credit.
Thank you.
When cops find the murder weapon three blocks from the crime scene, they want results.
You know, Frank, it is not going to help the case if I do a sloppy job.
Well, I mean...
how hard is it?
Just test fire Iverson's gun and compare the rounds.
(laughs):
I am getting to it.
Hey, you know what?
I think there's some fabric caught in the slide.
Let me see.
Huh.
Agostina.
Iverson's wife's a fan.
You know, your knowledge of the fashion world, it's-it's impressive.
Do you have something you want to tell me?
What?
It's my ex-wife's favorite designer.
She put me in hock with that stuff.
Okay.
If that's your story.
So, um, tell me how fast you can get Mrs. Iverson here.
The gun dealer ID'd your photo.
You bought your husband's gun back.
His father gave it to him.
He loved that gun.
You went to the Ice party to shoot Dakota.
It was the last day of the death pool, and I guess you figured with her stint in rehab, it'd be an easy opportunity to put one in the win column for your husband.
Can you prove that?
Yes.
We're executing a search warrant on your house as we speak to look for this.
It's a match of the Agostina dress you were wearing.
It caught in the gun slide as you shot Dakota.
(laughs)
There's gotta be hundreds of dresses that look like that.
No, you were the only one with the gun and the dress.
Katrina, we got you.
Kevin... (sighs)
Kevin finally got his big win so we could start fresh.
All I want is a fresh start.
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
(gasps)
Oh, my God.
(crying):
Oh, my God.
(crying)
(cell phone ringing)
This is Horatio Caine.
I'm sorry, I can't...
Tyler?
Tyler!
Tyler, where are you?
Tyler?
Rebecca.
Rebecca, where's Tyler?
You were supposed to bring him.
He's with a babysitter.
He's not with a babysitter.
Where is he?
He's fine.
Rebecca, where is he?
I owed some money, and I used him as collateral.
Okay, so you sold him.
No, they're just holding on to him.
I'm going to win him back.
Who did you sell him to?
(sighs)
A pony-tailed guy who works for Mr. Choi.
You make me sick.
(gasps)
(sighs heavily)
Agent Cole.
Horatio Caine.
I'm looking for your phone taps on the gambling ship, a specific number.
Give it to me.
Right.
The number is 305-555-0133.
Checking.
They called that number from the ship's office a half-hour ago.
Who's number is it?
(closes phone) It's mine.
FortuneMaker, this is the US Coast Guard.
Prepare to be boarded.
(men shouting orders)
(shouting orders)
(people laughing and cheering)
US Coast Guard!
(men shouting orders)
Hands where I can see them!
Hands where I can see them!
Hands where I can see them!
(shoing continues in distance)
Where's my mom?
You shut up.
CAINE:
Mr. Choi?
That'll be enough.
I'm closing you down.
You have no right to do this.
Everything on this ship is legal.
Everything but the boy.
Now stand up, turn around and put your hands on your head right now.
Do it.
Gentlemen.
US Coast Guard.
(handcuffs clicking)
You're under arrest for false imprisonment and kidnapping of a minor.
You okay, son?
I knew you'd find me.
I wasn't going to leave you, Tyler.
Come on.
(talking quietly)
We found over a million dollars in supernotes, so far.
Printing press is gone.
Don't worry, Agent Cole, it's going to turn up.
Just so it's not in Miami, right?
(chuckles):
Not if they're smart.
Agent Cole?
Take care.
(chuckles)
(brakes squeak)
Tyler?
I love you, baby.
Mommy?
(fire crackling)
People gambling their lives away and getting paid in fake hundreds.
Yeah, well, I hope we never see them again.
Yeah, well, me, too.
So, just how good were those bills?
More real than you can imagine.
I guess somebody will always think it's easy to make a hundred.
But we... we know different, don't we?
Wonder how many people reside in the whole world!
Different colours... different castes... different types...
Whereverthere are people there is one more thing...
No!
No!
I am not talking about crowds!
I am talking about relationships.
Mother-Father!
Brother-Sister!
Husband-Wife!
Or such relationships which have no name.
Then how are these relationships made?
What connects people in this world?
What is it that bonds us to each other?
Sentiment!
Yes it is sentiment that keeps us linked to each other.
Till this emotion is alive, our relationship is alive.
Our love is alive.
No one can teach you this emotion.
Except for life.
Hi, Rasik sir!
Catch!
Don't throw it like that.
It is a very sensitive device.
Sorry!
Sorry!
How is the car?
Excellent!
I really enjoyed the ride, sir.
Sign please, sir.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Where should I sign, on your face?
Sorry, sir.
Sign here.
Then you should tell that.
Sorry, sir.
Now go!
There is no need to come to work from tomorrow.
Thank you, sir.
Good morning, Aditya.
- Good morning.
Surprising!
She said good morning to you.
Why don't they say that to me?
Why do these super fast girls or super fast cars...
Why it doesn't happen with me?
Don't you know?
Whether a girl or a car, we must pamper them.
We must keep them with a lot of love.
Both need a lot of care and attention.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
This is general knowledge, sir.
Even a fool knows that.
You know what?
- What.
- What?
I have good news foryou.
- Tell me!
Tell me!
Follow me!
Tell me!
Please tell me!
Aditya!
Our company is going to launch a new car into the market.
Do you know we will be doing its marketing in entire India?
Oh, no!
I am finished.
No, you are not.
You are going to be my head.
I am ruined.
What ruined?
You are promoted.
Your salary is going to be increased.
Oh, no!
What is this?
You are going to Canada.
Boss!
My engagement party is today.
See this engagement ring.
Yes, I know.
I am also coming to it.
But it is at six o'clock.
What is the time now?
Six o'clock...
Now the time is five past six.
Don't know what Sonia will do to me now.
Wow!
Sonia looks gorgeous!
She looks very stylish today.
- She rocks.
Whose sister is she after all?
You know, she is a fashion designer.
You know, she understands fashion.
Hi, Tanya!
- Hi Sonia!
What does fashion mean to you?
Fashion is what I wear and others wear.
They are just clothes.
- I see.
My daughter Sonia is going to Paris next week.
For a fashion show.
She is a star you know.
Don't say that.
My would-be daughter-in-law is not a star but a rock star.
Rock star!
What's up with the latest dress code?
Red is the color of fashion forthe ladies, you know!
And what about black?
They are all...
Amrut!
- Yes?
I hope you told Adi that today is his engagement.
- Yes.
'Your heartbeats... '
- Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you removing your clothes?
If you want to pee, I'll stop the car.
You keep driving.
I don't want to pee.
I am just changing clothes.
Drive on fast.
You didn't invite Aditya.
It would have been better to invite him.
Who Aditya?
I think your son.
Today is his engagement with my daughter.
Where is your prince?
Call him.
Yes, please call him.
I too have elsewhere to go.
- Yes.
What are you doing?
Let me drive the car.
Oh!
I am...
I am sorry.
You will kill me.
He is a goner!
I don't know why Aditya is getting so late.
You know aunty, had this been a love marriage he would never be late.
Shut up, rascal!
Happy, listen to this.
- Tell me.
- Are you enjoying?
Did you call Adi or not?
- Call Adi?
- Please call.
Please call quickly.
I too have elsewhere to go.
Get out fast!
Go!
Go!
Boss!
Boss!
My shoe!
Oh!
Here comes my brother-in-law!
Hey Adi!
What happened?
Only one shoe?
Nothing!
The car took the shoe.
- The car took the shoe!
Adi, where were you?
Since when we are waiting foryou.
- Dad, the shoe...
Adi, does anyone do such a thing on such a day!
- Mother...
Adi!
Have some shame!
- Granny, what are you doing...
I have applied gel on my hair.
Don't spoil his hair.
- Really?
See this!
Hey!
Who is this?
I am not hitting him, I am making him wear it.
Dad!
Dad, he is my boss.
- He is your boss?
Sorry.
Let me explain to you...
this world class grandson of yours I am sending him to Canada.
Canada?
But why?
I will tell it...
I'll tell them.
I got a promotion.
Really!
?
- This is very good news.
You got a promotion and you didn't even tell us.
I too learnt it Just now.
Wow!
This is wonderful news.
And that too on engagement day.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Great!
I'm so happy.
How lucky is Sonia for Adi?
- Absolutely!
If you all are done then please make me lucky too.
I have got to go.
To Canada?
Hey Sonia, I must say your would-be husband is very fashionable.
Shut up!
I hope you got the ring.
- Yes, mom.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- What happened?
Uncle, please move on.
We'll come later.
Where's my ring?
-Which ring?
The engagement ring!
What are you saying?
It must be here.
One minute...
lift the coat.
It must be in the front pocket.
The front pocket.
This is my engagement ring.
- Where is it?
Lts not there in the left nor right.
Where is it?
Is there a hole in your pocket?
Oh c'mon!
What the hell are you doing here?
Everyone is waiting foryou.
C'mon.
The matter is...
Just go!
They are calling.
Your son-in-law is the best in the world.
He won't go below this!
You can take my word for it.
Hi handsome.
- I forgot the engagement ring.
He has forgotten the ring.
He has forgotten the ring.
- Oh!

You know, these traditions are indeed fabulous.
Two families come closer in the name of uniting two people.
They share little joys.
I just love it.
IJust love traditional marriage.
I don't think so.
I think it is a waste of time money and energy.
It is we who are getting married.
Then why are we calling our friends and relatives and feeding them?
One must be practical in life.
I don't care for traditions.
Everybody has his own opinion.
Yes.
Are you tired?
- Not much.
So...
- So?
Shall I leave?
- Ok.
Give me a kiss.
- What!
?
Give me a goodnight kiss.
Is this some time for a kiss?
There isn't a time for a kiss.
One has to be in the mood for it.
You have to be romantic.
Give me a kiss.
Aditya, someone might see.
Who is going to see us at 3.30 am?
And I've got the license too.
We Just got engaged...
you are my fiancée.
Please give me a kiss.
Just grow up!
Why... grown ups don't take kisses?
Tanya.
Sonia, why don't you give Aditya what he asked?
If you can't do it, I will do it.
Daddy too is ready in the room.
And he said that mom is ready too.
And for God's sake tell him to take the hand off the speaker phone.
It is 3.30 am in the morning.
Ridiculous that you are fighting over a kiss.
C'mon give him a kiss.
Don't know... they are engaged and then too for a kiss...
Good night.
- Good night.
Are we engaged?
- What do you mean?
Are we really engaged?
Grow up, Adi.
What are you saying?
I can't really believe this.
We are really engaged.
O madam, please convince him you are engaged.
Till he is not convinced, he will not let anyone sleep.
Can't believe!
- Go to sleep.
Gavin
-Yeah!
What kind of smell is this?
Stinking!
Excuse me please.
- Yes sir.
What kind of smell is this?
I will check out.
It is really stinking.
It must surely be some Indian.
- What happened?
They should know.
These days everything is available everywhere but they still move around with shop loads.
Disgusting!
- Disgusting!
Excuse me, sir.
Is this your bag?
How happy would your sister be that you are going to Canada!
Am I going to take all this luggage?
You aren't going to carry it on your head.
You are going by plane.
I won't take it.
Take it without saying a word.
It is our love.
Add a few more kilos of love!
These children!
How cute are they when they cry!
But they don't like us sleeping.
I can't understand at all why these people travel with such little children.
As if you would leave your kids behind!
Of course!
Since we are talking about it, we should make it clear.
I think we shouldn't think about kids for 5-6 years after marriage.
This is the time for our careers.
And I don't think we are ready for kids.
At least I'm not.
Sonia.
- Yes.
Sonia, this is the passport and ticket.
- Ok.
And call up Simran when you reach Paris.
Ok, I'll do it.
- Ok.
But you don't forget your workouts.
I hate unfit people and this T-Shirt looks cool on you.
I'll get you some more.
- Ok, thank you.
Ok, I'll leave then.
And listen...
Have a safe flight and take care.
I'll do that.
Bye!
You too take care, Aditya.
Uncle!
- Hey Dumpy.
What is this, uncle?
I sent you six emails.
You didn't reply even to one.
I was busy with my female and couldn't respond to your email.
Ok, sorry.
Come soon.
- There they are.
Adi!
- Uncle!
- Hey!
You are looking so young.
Wait!
Wait!
- My God I was scared!
How weak he has become, isn't it Raabi!
True!
Raabi has become really weak.
Weak... thank you.
Did you hear?
I've become weak.
Very funny.
How is Sonia?
They all look good before marriage.
Correct!
- Right!
Absolutely right.
Correct?
- No... wrong!
Absolutely wrong!
I mean Adi is wrong.
My brother is wrong?
That's me.
- Yeah.
My luggage.
- Ok.
Both you brother and sister are right.
I am wrong.
No need to explain to me.
- Listen to me.
Stop fighting.
How dare you touch my luggage!
- Sister.
- This is my luggage.
Leave it to me, Adi.
I know how to deal with these people.
Sister, he is from my company.
- I will call the police.
Sister, he is from my company.
What are you doing?
You are hitting him.
What will he think?
He's come to pick me.
He came to pick you?
Then who did we come here for?
You've indeed come for me.
But he is from my company.
He came to pick me up.
They've booked an apartment for me.
I am in contract with them.
Why don't you understand?
Why don't you explain it to her?
He is right.
I know he is right.
- Then what was the need to come here?
You could have got trained in Mumbai!
Sister, do you think that I like staying away from you?
- Huh!
I will come over in the weekends.
Every Sunday.
We will enjoy ourselves.
We will go for picnics.
We will go for lunches and parties... everything.
C'mon sis... c'mon!
Try to understand, please.
Hey man, why are you staring at me?
Take all this stuff.
- What did you say?
Take the luggage and take him also.
- Ok, c'mon.
I'll meet you overthe weekend.
Mom sent pickle foryou.
I'll get that too.
- It's ok.
So you seem like quite a family man.
Ya, unfortunately I've to stay alone.
No... you have a roommate.
- A roommate!
?
Welcome...
I am Nawab Sharif.
I am a gentleman only by name and not by actions.
I am from Pakistan.
Any problems?
Aditya Malhotra.
- Great!
Nice meeting you.
- I too feel great to meet you.

Let's go ahead.
Take it easy.
Come on Nawab!
Oh boy!
Aditya, you drive well.
- Thank you.
Buddy, was this a test drive or were you taking revenge against me forthe Kargil war?
Adi!
You know what I was thinking?
- Sir!
Why don't you represent us in cross country rally?
I would love to do that, sir.
- O beautiful!
Hang on.

Are you going out?
- No, why?
Then why are you looking like a Christmas tree?
Adi!
Eat the snacks.
Mom, what are you doing?
- It is Nawab's peg.
I know that it is liquor.
It is not a milk drinking age.
Kitty, aunty cannot hear well.
But granny can see quite well.
Mama!
I am gone.
It is the last chance to save the princess.
- Excuse me.
How does this start?
It is paused.
If you take your hand off the button it will play.
'if you take your hand off the button...
the lift will move.
- Sorry!
'
Left...
left...
Right... right...
Yes, yes, I am trying to save it.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh, my cake!
- What?
I am really sorry.
I didn't realise I was Just walking and I will Just clean it up.
What are you doing?
It's okay.
I am really sorry.
My apartment is there.
You can clean up the mess there.
Come!
No, its okay.
Thank you.
I'll manage.
Are you sure?
- Yeah!
- Are you sure?
Hey!
Nice dress!
Get it from the bakery shop.
Sorry, it is all because of me.
My offer is still open... please!
You look beautiful!
It is good that you accepted my advice.
Those children made a cake shop of you.
Will you have cream biscuits?
No, I am getting late.
I've got to be leaving.
Will you drink something?
- No.
Coke?
- No!
Orange Juice?
- No!
Tomato Juice?
- This is tomato ketchup.
Why do you always say no?
- Nothing like that.
You Just said no.
Your cake fell down because of me.
And I was thinking that your clothes got spoilt because of me.
You reduced my guilt by saying that.
Why feel guilty?
It was an accident.
I don't think so.
I think that whatever happens is all a master plan.
It's all destiny.
What do you think?
No.
Suppose that you get run over by a bus tomorrow.
Ya... thanks why not?
I said suppose... it will be because you weren't watchful.
It would not be because of a master plan.
So you mean to say that your coming to this apartment is not destiny?
Right?
No.
It is because we both took our eyes off the path.
That's why we bumped into each other.
But we both taking our eyes off and that too at this time...
Don't you think so?
That's destiny.
May be!
Anyway thanks for everything.
I must be going now.
Okay.
- Bye!
Are you sure you don't want to drink?
- No.
Thank you.
Bye!
O my God!
I am sorry.
The door was actually open.
I left my bag.
Never mind.
Go and take your bag.
Are you okay?
- Absolutely!
Go!
Your nose?
- Destiny!
Go!
- Really sorry.
Take this.
What is this for?
Oh, thank you.
Take care of yourself.
She's back.
-What brother?
Wow!
Yes, I got the message.
Actually I was busy.
Never mind!
At least we are now talking.
I am trying to be busy.
Shopping is so boring sometimes.
Thank God!
I can never handle shopping.
I'm overloaded with work.
Some people are so lucky.
They avoid all their duties in the name of work.
Excuse me, I am not giving any excuse.
Actually I was very busy.
I don't know how truthful you are.
But your sister is waiting here with a sword in hand.
What are you saying!
?
- Ho... ho... well!
You fool, where are you speaking from?
I am speaking from my mouth.
Very funny!
I was cooking your favourites since three days.
Come soon or I'll never talk to you in this life.
So you are now threatening me.
I don't know why I don't get such threats.
Very funny!
It's not funny any more, Jennifer.
You don't understand.
Shopping alone like this...
and Karan is just not bothered.
C'mon Jia!
Don't sound so low.
Is there any girl in this world who is bored of shopping?
And that too when she is shopping for her marriage.
- Excuse me, please sign this.
I tell you what let's change places.
I'll do the shopping foryou and you become the PAto Karan.
At least you'll get closerto yourfiancée.
What do you say?
- Oh, yeah!
Okay... take care.
- You too.
Oh, I am sorry.
- Its okay.
Oops!
- Sorry...
I...
You?
Twice!
I think we should learn to shake hands.
Aditya Malhotra!
- Jia...
Jia Yashvardhan!
What a unique name!
Jia...
Jia Yashvardhan!
Very nice!
Not twice.
Just Jia.
It's ok.
Thanks.
Let me help you.
- No... really it's fine.
There must be some punishment for bumping in.
Tell me one thing.
Whenever I meet you why do you carry so many bags?
Do you do smuggling?
No!
Shopping!
I mean what do you do besides shopping?
I Just keep shopping on various pretexts.
Oh, nice Job!
And you.
And what do you do?
Are you asking me what I do besides bumping into you?
Do you never get serious?
I would be in a hospital if I became serious.
But not going around with you in a mall.
I like your smile.
- Thanks.
You didn't tell me what you do.
I work hard.
I help people.
I bump into them, pick up their bags and drop them to their vehicles.
That's my Job.
Please pick up our bags too.
Ghuggi...
Ghuggi...
I am coming.
How are you?
- I am fine.
What are you doing here?
- I am getting trained.
Do you need training even for this Job?
Didn't you get trained in college?
Greetings!
- Greetings!
We are not friends Just from happy days.
We are friends even before that.
Sis-in-law!
- Sis-in-law?
You used to have a girl friend at college.
What's her name?
Pammi!
- Yes, Pammi!
He had a girl friend in college.
What happened to her?
Now she is not my girl friend.
Thank God!
You are lucky that she is not your girl friend.
What do you mean?
Except you and a few other guys she had affairs with everyone else in college.
She is...
She is my wife now.
She is beautiful... she is nice...
she was very good... she was...
Excuse me!
- Ghuggi!
Ghuggi!
You should not have spoken like that.
I was just Joking.
Unnecessarily he got angry.
But the matter became serious.
Aditya!
ParamJeet?
Yes, ParamJeet...
Pammi!
What do you think of yourself?
Just shooting off your mouth!
When did you see me roaming with other guys?
Sis-in-law!
- Sis-in-law!
?
Now you are giving me respect.
What happened to all that when you maligned me in front of Sardar-Ji?
Sis-in-law!
I was Just Joking.
It takes just a minute to break a relation.
But takes a life time building them.
And you...
Where has Sardar-Ji gone?
Sardar-Ji!
I am sorry, sister.
I lost my brother.
I am sorry, brother, I lost my husband.
We are moments away from starting.
Can I have the mike?
I have to say few words.
Please, sir.
Please!
Stop her!
Hey stop!
Okay.
- No!
No!
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Hey!
I know this lady.
Where are you?
Please, my dear!
Don't do this to me.
Otherwise... otherwise I swear by you...
I will kill myself.
Where are you?
I say, where are you?
Sorry ladies and gentleman for interrupting your evening.
Today this lady who is standing beside me needs your help to reassure her husband what the meaning of true love is!
It's because of my ignorance I caused her husband to suspect, doubt and question his wife.
I know that you are listening to me.
You are so fortunate that you have got such a loving wife.
But you are unlucky that you don't have faith in her love.
How can anyone listen to stray words and doubt his love?
There is no room for doubt in love.
Where there is love there should only be love.
Only love!
You too cannot remain happy entertaining such doubt.
If anyone of you find him around please make him understand.
That it is not worth breaking the relationship for such small things.
This is his photograph.
Please, cameraman!
Can you zoom on it?
Okay.
- Okay.
Please, I beg all of you to spread the magic of love everywhere.
Whatever I said earlier was a Joke.
But whatever I said now is the truth.
That is the only truth.
Pammi!
Pammi!
You are one and I am one.
And we have God's blessings on us.
We both should embrace each othertightly.
And the one who releases the embrace first will be a deceiver.
Thank God, both of them united again.
'There is no room for doubt in love.'
'Where there is love there should only be love.
Only love!
'
Hello!
- Hello, Jia!
How are you?
Jenny!
Where is Karan?
He is in meeting as usual.
It's a big business deal.
How romantic!
Oh, come on Jia!
Just think from his side.
He wants to buy all the happiness in this world foryou.
Happiness cannot be bought, Jenny.
He promised me to come with me to shop forthe marriage.
You know... that he never bought anything else except factories and shares?
I know.
Karan loves you a lot, Jia.
But the problem is he doesn't know how to express it.
Anyway, tell me what shopping you did today.
I bought a book for Karan.
40 Landscapes...
Sports cars?
40 Landscapes.
Wow!

What?
- What are you thinking?
Tell me something, Nawab.
Did your God make only one woman for every man?
Buddy!
He made two girls for me.
First one came to my life and took away all my money.
The second one came and saw that I didn't have any money.
So she took my heart and went away.
She didn't return it till now.
Now I will sell this remaining body to go to Pakistan.
Hey, what can I get foryou?
For the moment same stuff continue.
And you, sir?
- What?
He will have that girl.
The one in pink.
Its totally full, ma'am.
- Oh I see.
I am afraid we can't serve dishes that are out of our kitchen.
No.
I am okay with this.
Thank you.
You have to wait for 15 minutes.
Are you still thinking?
No, buddy.
Are you mad?
Okay...
I'm Just coming!
Where are you going?
- To the washroom.
I'll wait here then.
- Okay fine.
Aditya, I shall go now.
Pay the bill.
- Okay.
Hi!
- Jia!
?
Hi...
Hi...
- Hi!
Why are you here?
Me?
I came for dinner.
He said that I have to wait.
Okay, why don't you Join me?
Are you sure?
- Yes, sure.
Okay.
- Come.
So, this is our third unscheduled meeting.
What to say?
Is this an accident or a coincidence?
I'll still say that it's destiny.
Hey!
enjoy yourself.
It's our 25th wedding anniversary.
Congratulations...
- Thanks!
Indian?
- Yes, of course!
You both look so good together.
How many years it is since you are married?
No... no, we are not married.
Then when are you getting married?
Oh, no!
No...
Actually I am already engaged.
My wedding is on September 25th.
I see!
And mine is in October.
Exactly 15 days after her marriage.
Actually we are...
we are Just friends.
Oh, that's more important.
Normally my guess never goes wrong.
I don't know how that happened this time.
Anyway come on, let's dance.
What is it that keeps them together even after so many years of marriage?
Feelings.
- Feelings?
A feeling is just what unites us.
Our relationship is alive so long as this feeling is alive.
Our love too is alive because of that.
The day when this feeling...
Oh, it is very cold today.
Yes, it's cold.
Quite chilly!
Yes, you shouldn't have come out.
I am afraid you might catch a cold.
You want my Jacket?
No.
Its okay.
Taxi...
I don't think any taxi will stop.
It is very late.
If you want I will come with you to the hotel.
If you want.
No, it's okay.
I will manage.
Are you sure?
- Yes.
Okay.
- Bye!
- Bye!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
Aditya!
Yes.
What happened, Jia?
Shall we go together?
- Sure!
See this.
- What?
See what's written here.
- Oh!
John loves SuJi, Mr. And Mrs. Smith, for the one I love...
It feels good when the names of two people in love are written.
Yes, some lovers don't want to get separated.
I never thought that we would meet like this in this unknown country.
You won't let anyone remain a stranger.
- Yes.
Why do people whistle?
People passing by will stop.
Come on!
Hotel Sheraton.
- Yes sir.
By sitting on this chariot I remembered Marine drive.
Did you ever go to Mumbai?
What do you mean...
I am from Mumbai.
And that too from Marine drive!
Don't tell me!
Last year we shifted to Bandra.
I too stay at Marine drive.
Do you know the restaurant Barista?
Just behind it.
No way.
I used to go there all the time.
And my favourite order was French vanilla...
What a small world!
We may have crossed each other a thousand times.
I don't think so.
- Why?
If I ever crossed you, I would have stood still.
I wouldn't still be moving.
Stop!
- Yes.
Jia!
- I have to go now.
Give me the money.
Give me the money...
Let me go...
Let me go...
Hey... hey.
Don't...
don't... don't do that.
You want the money...
you want the money...
I will give you money.
Okay?
Don't hurt her.
Okay.
Yes, there is a lot of money.
Here, c'mon take it.
Don't hurt her!
Don't hurt her!
Hey, take... don't do that...
I told you don't hurt her.
Aditya!
Guys!
C'mon let's go.
The cops are coming.
The cops are coming.
It's me... okay...
please stop crying.
It's okay.
They have gone.
Don't cry.
Just take it easy.
They have all gone.
Stop it...
Just calm down...
please!
- Aditya!
Take it easy... take it easy.
They have gone.
We reached your hotel.
Had you not been there...
How is that possible?
I love to become superman.
How couldn't I come?
Bye!
- Bye!
'if I ever crossed you, I would have stood still.'
'I wouldn't still be moving.'
Hello!
- Aditya!
Jia, is that you?
Is everything okay?
Yes.
I don't know why but I wanted to talk to you.
Sleep now, Jia.
It is very late in the night.
We can talk tomorrow morning.
Good night!
Good night!
I don't know why nothing works over here.
Sir, will you have some coffee?
Except forthis bloody coffee machine!
Look guys, we have one of the best dealership over here.
We have the best cars to sell.
- Right.
But we don't sell the most.
Why?
Yes, Mr. Sharif!
Why are you clapping for now?
Sir, because the growth of the company...
Nothing grows here except your hair.
And look at the cheap colour as well.
And what about tomorrow's rally?
Are you ready forthat?
Sir!
We are trying our level best.
I hope so everything goes well tomorrow.
Are you stupid, shut up?
The boss' engine is very hot.
Buddy, even our engine is hot since two days.
Hi!
- Hi!
Bye!
What wrong, Aditya?
I've come to meet you.
Yes, but I can't meet you now.
And my boss is very angry right now.
This vehicle is a superb one.
What are you doing?
Why are you pushing me?
I've come to kidnap you.
Let's go for lunch.
Let's do one thing.
I'll resign and come.
Then we'll go.
Resign!
?
Before my boss throws me out I'll come out on my own.
What do you think?
Boss!
Do you speak Hindi?
Yes, very well.
Show me this car.
And ya... you are right...
very nice selection, ma'am.
Let me help you.
Okay, you resign and come.
I'll wait.
Sir!
Excuse me!
What happened?
Won't you resign?
It is frustration here and celebration at night.
Where is the celebration?
It is my nephew's birthday.
Look straight.
We have to go to the birthday party.
What will I do there?
They have called a few Jokers.
But they haven't turned up.
I thought I'll take you along.
- Okay.
Yeah, that's right.
You like it.
Done.
- Done, sir.
Done!
Did you like the car?
- Yes, I liked it.
Done!
- Done!
See you in the evening.
- Done!
They think I am a fool.
Hey, Dumpy!
Happy birthday.
I am late because of your uncle.
I'll leave.
- Let's go.
Uncle!
- How are you?
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
She is Jia...
birthday boy Dumpy.
Happy birthday, Dumpy.
- Thank you.
Uncle, where did you get this parrot from?
Keep quiet.
Uncle!
The bird is very cute.
Does she kiss or not?
Have some shame.
Have some shame.
What is your age?
She has not even embraced me.
You are mad.
Stop your ranting.
You don't even have manners.
If not you make her kiss me.
You will be beaten along with your uncle.
What's he saying?
Are you talking about him?
- Ya...
He is saying in punjabi that his mother is very angry with us because we came very late.
And this boy speaks a lot but his granny is hard of hearing.
Our family is very weird.
So let's go inside and see what will happen to us.
Let's go in.
- Come on.
I say, have some more.
- What are you doing?
Not a cool drink, get me some wine.
No!
No, we are not allowed to serve.
Raabi!
Come on, don't be embarrassed.
Its okay.
Hi, everybody!
Hello!
- Hi.
Why is everyone looking at me like that?
It is not their mistake.
I think they hate me.
I won't let it happen.
Why are you looking like that?
She is my friend.
Can't I bring my friend to a party?
She is Jia...
Jia...
Jia Yashvardhan.
- Yes!
Yes!
She is my sister.
She is always angry.
IJust came along to wish Dumpy on his birthday.
You don't mind.
No!
No!
Not at all...
not at all...
Look, mom...
What Jia got for me...
Isn't it cool?
Thank you so much... so sweet!
Welcome... welcome...
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Here comes your guest.
They may be your guests.
Not ours.
Why do you get angry?
Okay, sister.
I am sorry for being late.
We are late because she spent time in make-up.
Make-up!
?
I mean, explain it to her.
She always gets angry.
That is her way of showing love.
Stop it.
It is enough.
Love can never be enough.
- The Rakhi festival is about to come.
So, I think she needs a lump sum amount.
Adi, you too.
Oh!
I don't get it even if I ask.
Never mind!
Get the Rakhi tied and you too will get it.
Rabbi... what a nice song...
Jia, give me that curry.
- Yes.
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
- We are Just going to the wash room.
Come on soon before the work is done.
Raabi!
- What, mom?
How come all three guys want to shit together?
He brought us to some party.
Hi, Pammi!
She was in such a good mood.
She said that we should stay in a hotel.
I was a fool to reject such a hot offerfrom my wife and come to this cold party.
No, buddy!
You got an offerfrom your wife.
But I left an offer from another's wife.
Here there is neither liquor nor beautiful women.
Do something.
What can I do?
All of them are bro-in-law's friends.
They are all behaving like English men.
I'll teach a lesson to these English men.
One minute!
One minute!
Now it will be interesting.
What are you doing, will you drink?
This is English stuff.
If everyone consumes it a little the true nature will come out.
You fool!
Everyone drinks Juice.
- Take it.
This is the age of adulteration.
We'll mix it a little in the Juice and no one will come to know.
What a good plan!
We have the same ideas on both sides of the border.
Oh my gosh!
My leg!
My son has a hotel at the top of the restaurant.
Shall I have the room opened?
Aunty!
We were discussing...
you misunderstood us.
Were you kissing?
Not kissing, aunty.
We were discussing.
There is a conference hall too above.
Go and discuss there.
Oh, my... disgusting people...
Aunty!
You misunderstood us.
Now we will mix in all the drinks.
Get the bottle.
What are you doing?
Drink it and see.
- How much will you make me drink?
C'mon darling!
It is plain Juice.
Give it to mom also.
No.
This is sweet and she will get sugar complaint.
Nothing will happen in one glass.
Give it.
As you wish.
The Juice is okay foryou, mom.
It is not wine.
Take it.
One more.
No.
You have diabetes... please...
Is this Juice your daddy's?
No, it is orange Juice.
What will I lose?
Wait... one more.
One more.
- Excuse me.

You can kiss, isn't it?

You too.
Thanks for being so nice to him.

I have laughed so much that my eyes are filled with tears.
Your hotel has come.
Come on, what happened?
Nothing!
You know, Aditya...
what is the most beautiful moment in my day?
- What is it?
When I come to meet you.
And do you know what the worst moment in my day is?
It is when I go away after meeting you.
But why do these moments come together?
I don't understand.
I'll leave.

- What?
Give me a ring.
- Ring!

On phone!
- Okay.
Call me.
- Take care!
You take care too.
I'll take care of my thoughts too.
Hi, best of luck.
Yes, I desperately need that.
Where is Nawab?
- Overthere.
What happened to him?
Nothing!
I warned him last night not to over eat.
But he didn't listen to me.
Now he has loose motions.
He is going to the toilet repeatedly.
I don't know what to do.
What will happen now?
Nothing.
We lost the race even before it started.
I don't have a navigator.
I'll go and tell those people that I don't have a navigator and so I can't participate.
1, 2, 3, 4,
Aditya!
- What happened?
I can try.
Can you clean the car?
- I can try.
I think your luck is working.
Are you okay?
- Yeah!
Nice parking.
Sorry, I dozed off.
What will happen now?
Nothing!
Now we have to wait till morning.
What else?
Till morning?
- Yes.
What will we do till morning?
You sleep here and I here.
Because these doors won't open now.
We are covered with snow all over.
We'll go to sleep.
What else?
Good night.
I can't sleep.
You know I used to have the same problem in childhood.
I would not get to sleep.
Then my mother would say that if you can't sleep then you must think of such a place where you want to go.
And close your eyes.
Gradually you'll get to sleep.
Yeah, believe me.
I am telling you the truth.
Some times I used to think and go into space.
It is amazing.
Oh, that's not possible.
It is.
I am telling you.
It's a fact.
You don't believe me?
Okay, let us try once and see.
Close your eyes.
We'll... try... come on...
Stop looking here...
come on... come on...
Close your eyes.
Jia, where are you?
Rome, Spanish steps...
It's so beautiful.
Where are you?
In the heaven of Kashmir...
lovely.
I always wanted to see Kashmir.
Hold my hands and see how tall the mountains are.
How does it feel from here?
What happened?
I am scared of heights.
See, Jia.
Only after reaching heights in life can we see new paths.
And by travelling on those paths we can attain new goals.
What about the relations that we kept all along?
In life some relationships exist which we know but don't want to tell ourselves.
But the heart inside understands everything.
It knows everything.
The heart shows dreams which can never become true.
The distance between dreams and reality is the wink of an eye.
It is a dream when the eye is closed and reality when it is open.
It is not so easy, Aditya.
Why not?
Come on, dare to dream.
I am scared that I'll get lost.
I'll see that you won't get lost.
Trust me.
Give me your hand.
Now close your eyes and see that your dreams are waiting foryou.

Okay.
I'll park the vehicle and come.
I'll meet you down in five minutes.

You girls have strange ways!
You said five minutes but took forty.
Actually I...
Who is there, honey?
- Karan... it is...
Yes?
- Actually it is...
- Room service, sir.
Your hotel knows that I'm not to be disturbed.
Actually I called him.
Your uniform?
Sir, it was the last call of the shift.
I already changed my clothes.
I am sorry about that, sir.
That's being very unprofessional.
You know I can get you sacked forthat.
Sorry sir.
- Anyway clean the mess.
- Sure.
It's ok.
I think it can be done later.
That's his Job, honey.
Let him do it.
Excuse me waiter.
- Yes sir.
That's a tip foryou and next time come in uniform.
Ok?
I will be careful, sir.
Honey, I forgot to ask you.
How was your shopping?
- Okay, not bad.
Welcome, Mr. Oberoi.
- Hello.
How are you sir?
Always the best.
You want a picture?
Gentlemen, he is the son of my friend.
He has grown up in front of me.
Afterthe unfortunate death of Mr. And Mrs. Oberoi the way he managed the business it's amazing!
Mr. Oberoi, your marriage and this project...
won't there be a clash?
It's a merger it is not a clash.
You know each other for quite some time what do you like about Karan?
Jia, cut the list short.
Mr. Oberoi how do you classify your marriage, love or arranged?
Of course love!
I love her and she loves me.
Karan, please!
- Why?
What happened?
I don't like doing it forthe photos.
Look honey, I am Karan Oberoi.
Whatever I do, they're bound to take pictures.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.
But they are waiting for you inside.
- Ok, come.
Good evening sir.
- Hello.
- Good evening.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
Here he is.
Welcome, my son.
Meet Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Gupta.
Mr. Thapar.
- Good evening, Mr. Thapar.
How are you?
And Mr. Mittal.
Congratulations, Mr. Oberoi.
You are getting married to Yashvardhan.
You've taken overthe steel industry.
You must be a happy man.
You have everything, man.
Everything... one takeover is still left.
What?
- Your company.
I am sorry.
You must be Joking.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
C'mon let's go.
- I am very serious.
I am Just observing that Karan is not marrying me.
He is Just doing a take-over.
It is betterthat you make it a habit.
Your Pizza, sir.
Aah... thank God you are here.
I am very hungry.
- Me too.
enjoy guys!
- Thank you!
Won't you say anything?
I am thinking about what to say.
Won't you ask me to come in?
Sorry!
Please come in.
Thank you.
I like this anger of yours.
Actually what happened that day is...
That is past.
You are completely wet.
Why don't you go and change?
Okay.
Thank you.
This is yours.
Why isn't everyone like you, Aditya?
You understand everything without me saying anything.
Silence is also strange.
If it enters a relationship then it turns into suffocation.
Coffee?
- Thank you!
My father used to talk to everyone except to my mother.
Dad had only a physical relation with my mother.
He used to beat her and she bore it all silently.
Mom used to love dad a lot.
People say that love can change anyone.
But it couldn't change my dad.
Even today people think that my mom committed suicide.
But I know that dad's silence killed her.
My father killed her.
His indifference killed her.
The weather outside is very bad.
It is betterthat you stay here tonight.
It is said that the sunlight after a rain will be beautiful.
Do you like coffee cold?
- No.
Then drink it hot.
Cheers!
Who is it?
- There is a girl in the room upstairs.
Don't you think you must do something?
Nawab!
She is very worried.
I know that.
You can make herforget her worries.
It cannot be done by sleeping here.
You have to go upstairs.
Shut up!
Go and sleep, Nawab.
Please go upstairs, buddy.
Please go.
It is very late in the night, Nawab.
I am telling you.
Please think again.
I don't want to speak to you.
Oh, sorry.
No!
No, Jia!
I didn't say that to you.
Out!
No!
Not you.
I am telling that to Nawab.
There he goes behind you.
I couldn't sleep.
That is why...
I too couldn't sleep.
That is why I am watching the movie.
Which movie is this?
Junglee!
Hey, Shammi Kapoor!
- He is my favourite.
'That means you love someone.'
'Do you know when you love someone the confusion in your heart will increase.'
'You cannot understand my feelings.'
'I love you a lot!
I love you a lot.'
How easily they said 'I love you.'
Popcorn?
I wish it was so easy.
- I wish it was so easy.
"Alas!
What should I do?"
I love this song.
IJust love the way he dances in this.
Shammi Kapoor man, he's God.
I wish I could dance like him.
Then we can try.
It shouldn't be difficult.
Come on, let's try.
- No!
No!
It will be fun.
It will be really fun.
Come on!
Come on, get up.
"Alas!
What should I do?"
The DVD got stuck.
- Yes.
I will forward it.
It would have been nice if we could forward life too.
Then the fun of living will go away.
But we can know which relationships last life long and which are short-lived.
Would you like to spend your life with me?
"I will be thankful to you if you let me tell you my feelings."
"I am in love with you...
let me take shelter in your eyes."
"I will be thankful to you if you let me tell you my feelings."

Seems like you didn't sleep all night.
I was waiting foryour reply.
Let me think over it.
The wait is only till 6 pm tomorrow.
Same restaurant.
I can't come at 6... because I'll reach there by 5.30
Hi... good morning.
- Hi... good morning
So early in the morning.
Where are you coming from?
A morning walk.
A morning walk or... who is it?
Who?
- You know it.
C'mon Jia, out with it.
His name is Aditya...
- And?
He too is from India.
We met by sheer coincidence and that became my destiny.
I don't even know how it all happened.
I can't... do you know what you are saying, Jia?
I know Just one thing.
That he is the one for me.
He is so loving... he is so caring...
and he is so funny.
He is so friendly and caring.
And the most important thing is that when he is with me he is Just with me.
He makes me come alive.
I can see that.
But you are forgetting that you are Jia Yashvardhan and shall be Jia Oberoi.
These two names and their status is much greater than your life and every happiness of yours.
I think that you don't know about Karan Oberoi.
You rememberthat in your engagement party the editor of a national newspaper got drunk and misbehaved with you in front of the entire press.
Yes, but I did forgive him.
What you don't know is that Just a week later that editor was killed in an accident and all the offices of that paper were gutted by fire.
Karan Oberoi neverforgives.
When he loves you... he owns you.
I don't care, Jenny.
IJust don't care.
All this mattered till I didn't meet this one.
You don't know him.
He is Just like that.
Hi, sweetheart.
Talking about me?
It means you are madly in love Just like me.
Angry?
I am sorry.
I know that I was very busy with the delegates last night.
But what can I do?
Everybody wants a piece of Karan Oberoi and I'm sure I must have ignored you.
But I promise you.
I swear on anyone this will never happen again.
Now smile... smile...
Excuse me, sir.
The press are here forthe interview.
They are waiting downstairs.
Sorry Jia.
Can't get on the bad side of press.
I'll return soon.
Nice shopping, Jia.
Doesn't the size look a bit odd?
But it's not looking bad.
Actually very bad.
See only those dreams that you are allowed to.
Oryou'll have hard times.
Herfather is responsible for her mother's death.
She faced many troubles in her life.
Such a father should be dragged on to streets...
Nawab, she is so lonely you know.
Lonely?
Why will she be when you are there?
I want to see her happy.
That's all.
I saw anotherJia inside her.
I am afraid that she may face trouble because of me.
We shouldn't be afraid of troubles.
We should face them.
I am going for a Jog.

- 5.30.
Thank you.
Hi... sugar.
Karan... you?
Here?
Shouldn't I be here?
- No, I mean...
- Some wine?
Thanks!
I thought of giving you a surprise.
But you surprised me.
I don't know why, Jia.
The more I see you the more I find you beautiful... gorgeous, stunning...
There is some strange intoxication in yourfragrance.
Why did you do this...
why did you do this to me?
Karan!
What are you saying?
I don't understand.
You know who you are to me.
Ya... yourfiancé...
My fiancé.
My fiancé, yes you are going to be my wife.
My wife by practice and not by law.
So you must have same respect for me which every wife should have for her husband.
I have a right on your every breath and thought.
Moreover I don't like it piecemeal.
Is that clear...
Good...
Excuse me...
Dad!
What is this?
What is this...
What is this?
You accused me of killing your mother.
That too in front of some stranger.
They are trash!
See how they ruined our prestige forthe sake of money.
Dad I was...
- Enough is enough.
Jennifer, book us on the next flight.
We are going back to India right now.
Its okay.
Its okay.
Excuse me, Jia Yashvardhan, room no 1204.
Is she in her room?
No, sir.
There is no one.
They left forthe airport.
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
We have time.
Go and freshen up.
Go!
Jia!
What's happening, Jia?
Where are you going?
I am talking...
I am talking to you.
Where are you going?
Who the hell are you?
Who are you to me?
Why should I tell you?
So that you can cash on my emotions again?
Cash!
?
You should have told me if you wanted money.
My father is a very rich man.
You would have got more money than this.
What!
?
- Yes.
I told you the things that I was afraid to say to myself.
Because I had faith in you.
More than I have on myself.
But you betrayed me...
Jia... what are you trying to say?
Read this... read it...
Are you okay?
- Ya... fine...
I didn't get this written.
I didn't tell it.
Believe me.
No...
I will never believe anyone from now.
I hate you.
I hate the moments I spent with you.
And I hate myself for having a relationship with you.
Jia...
Jia...
Jia.
No...
you cannot go leaving me...
Jia, I love you.
Believe me.
Trust me I can't live without you... trust me.
Don't ask anyone to trust you in future.

Anyway I am so happy to see you.
Me too.
I am very happy too.
You didn't tell us about your shows.
How did they go?
Fantastic!
They were so successful that there was no end to buyers' inquiries.
And guys, I'm soon going to be a brand name.
Give me a five forthat!
- You are rocking Sonia!
Sonia, what it means is...
You have to move around because of your profession sometimes to Paris and sometimes to London.
How will you both manage after marriage?
We did it till now and will do it in future too.
What do you say, Aditya?
See, he understands me.
He knows that only lucky people get such opportunities.
And I don't want to lose this opportunity at any cost.
You know I worked really hard forthis.
What is the need to wearthis?
Anyway you look like your mother.
Very funny!
He looks so handsome!
Now I'll scare grandma.
Why are you silent and dull?
What happened, Adi?
Nothing.
I know...
I know that Sonia came to spend a little time.
But she came foryou only.
And we are not leaving her alone.
Sonia, you are free to go.
Did you miss me?
You might have remembered me a little bit.
No?
It is very good that you didn't remember me.
But this time I missed you.
Initially I used to think that you are my desire and career is my necessity.
But being away from you I realised now that you are my necessity.
Now I am afraid of this distance.
Shall I tell you something, Adi?
One knows how close the other person to them is only when they move away from them.
I feel so complete with you.
I feel like flying.
I don't understand from where I should start this.
Why?
What happened?
Adi, I am the reason for what happened between Jia and you.
I am responsible for all this mess...
You trusted me and told me everything about Jia.
I told everything to my friend in a drunken state.
Adi, I...
I didn't mean it.
I...
Believe me, Adi!
I didn't know that there was also a Journalist sitting there.
He printed all that.
I am...
I'm not trying to Justify myself, Adi.
I know that it doesn't make any difference whether I was drunk or a Journalist was sitting at that place.
Actually, I have broken yourtrust.
I've taken away...
I've taken away your happiness from you.
It's okay.
Come on, it is getting late.
Let's go to work.
Please forgive me, Adi.
It's okay.
C'mon, forget it.

Ask him.
He never brings me here.
I got tired asking him time and again.
Mom!
Whenever I apply for a visa they reject it saying that her photo doesn't match.
Very funny!
I mean how beautiful she became due to my love.
And who is this?
- I am Sharif.
That can be seen from yourface.
That's okay.
But who are you?
Madam, I am Nawab Sharif, a friend of Aditya.
I came here forthe marriage.
The marriage procession has come but where is the groom?
I am here, Bebe!
My son, why are you standing so far off?
Come here.
Come and embrace your Bebe.
Yes, I will.
My heart is contented!
Why are my son's eyes wet?
IJust remembered mother.
- Oh!
What are you doing, Adi?
Why don't you understand?
This path gives you only trouble and nothing else.
I know that I am wrong.
But I can't help it.
Man may be wrong.
But God is never wrong.
He pairs people with a plan.
And his decisions are our destiny.
Then what is love...
what is love?
Love is...
Nothing will come of your love but listen to one thing carefully.
If tears flow from your eyes then our happiness too will be lost.
Now see this!

She ate my ears!
Call from your Sonia.
Hi, Sonia!
I love you...
why isn't there any reaction?
The hottest girl in India is saying that she loves you.
But there is no reaction from you.
Are you angry that I didn't come to the airport?
No, Sonia.
That is not the matter.
I am so sorry, Adi.
I really wanted to come.
I am Just too busy.
It is Just like a mad house here.

It is such a big event.
It's Just too prestigious, Adi.
Will you please do what I want?
Tell me.
- Come here.
I want to meet you very much.

How much time is it going to take?
Sir, Just 5 more minutes.

Sonia, I can't come... you go.
C'mon...
Aditya, it is good to be seen in these parties.
Sonia, I don't know anyone there.
I feel very awkward...
I can't.
What awkward?
Can't you do even this for me?
Okay.
C'mon now.
I'll change and come.
Adi, that...
- Come on.
But...
- Come on, I know.
Lets go from here.
O God!
You really look beautiful.
Karan, can I ask you something?
- Yes.
What is it that will keep our relationship alive even afterthe marriage?
Of course, our marriage certificate.
Karan, I need to know it.
If you need to know it, then listen.
Your beautiful eyes...
your lips... your loveliness...
No, Karan... there has to be something else.

"How could you think that I would deceive you?"
"You went back on the promises you made to me"
"How will the Journey go on if you get scared Just now?"
"Why did you stop midway after starting to walk with me?"
"Why did you stop midway after starting to walk with me?"
"How will the Journey go on if you get scared Just now?"
"He lighted such a lamp of hope that the entire life is spent soaked in those thoughts."
"She came to me with the beauty of heryouth."
"With the story of love playing softly on her lips."
"She came to me with the beauty of heryouth."
"With the story of love playing softly on her lips."
"Made me restless.
Played with my emotions and made me crazy."
"You played the game of love with me but fell for a stranger."
"You played the game of love with me but fell for a stranger."
"How will the Journey go on if you get scared Just now?"
"Why did you stop midway after starting to walk with me?"
"Why did you stop midway after starting to walk with me?"
"How will the Journey go on if you get scared Just now?"
Okay, buddy!
Sorry... sorry...
It's okay.
It's not okay, madam... it's not okay.
No, no, it's really fine.
Okay.
No!
No, madam.
One shouldn't bump into others like this.
Listen to me.
A man shouldn't bump into others like this.
First he bumps and then they introduce each to the other.
Afterthat both of them fall in love.
Same this happened to Aditya.
My friend Aditya.
Aditya...
Jia all messed up.
Who's Aditya?
That one standing alone.
I feel sorry for him.
Yes, I know everything about Aditya.
No!
No, you don't know anything.
How can you know that?
I'll tell you.
Although it's too late.
But I'll tell you.
I was drunk and told everything to my friends.
You fell in love.
But your mistake is you loved him so much that a small misunderstanding appeared like a betrayal.
Why to talk about that, Jenny?
I am married now.
No, Jia...
Jia...
Jia...
We love only once in our life.
Second time it is Just adjustment.
Just adjustment.
I feel really bad foryou and really bad for Aditya.
Really bad.
Aditya...
Jia, you shouldn't come here.
If I didn't come at now...
I would never be able to forgive myself.
Bygones are bygones.
Forget them.
IJust want to see you happy.
I will try if you want it.
Good...
I must go now.
If we meet again someday in our life...
No.
No, that will not happen.
That will not happen...
I told myself that the time I spent with you are the best moments of my life.
I will keep the memories of those moments carefully in my heart.
They are going to be with me...
Okay...
Listen!
Will you give me one chance?
So that I can Just feel those moments of closeness again?
Jia Oberoi
Aditya Malhotra...
I will always rememberyou.
I will always rememberyou.
Will you always stay with me?
I will always keep you with me.
But will you come occasionally to carry my shopping bags?
You have good sense of humour.
Your smile is very bad.
- I know.
So, he is Aditya, whom you gave your heart too.
No.
You love him.
There are many faces of love, Karan.
But now you are everything to me.
But, I saw for myself...
I saw you hugging him.
That was a weak moment in my life.
But believe me, I am yours and only yours.
I see...
I see...
Can you look at me Just once the way you look at him?
Can you?
Karan Oberoi!
You don't know who Karan Oberoi is...
You are lucky...
you are still alive...
Jia is innocent.
Who are you to say that?
Because of you...
Just because of you she isn't mine even after becoming mine.
I want to kill you... but how can I remove you from her heart?
First you remove this doubt from your heart, Mr. Oberoi.
Get lost...
Just go away...
before I...
Just get lost!
Why did you do this?
Why?
It was not in my control.
It Just happened.
And continued to happen.
Why me... why with me, God?
I'll bring the taxi.
Jia...
Jia... are you alright, Jia?
Just hold on.
Jia.
Just give me a hand.
Leave me.
Jia, Just give me hand.
- Leave me I say.
The petrol is coming out.
It may catch fire at any moment.
Don't be stupid.
I said get out.
Leave me.
Fine, Jia.
What if you want to be here?
Fine...
I am also going to be here...
this damn car may go on fire...
Fine!
Why did you come here, Aditya?
Why did you come here?
Trust me.
- Just go away.
- Come on.
Let me get you out from here.
- Just go away.
Should I say something?
You don't know how to do it.
What will I do by staying alive?
You need to be alive if I have to be alive.
It's Aditya...
Adi, go from here... go...
Adi...
Leave me...
Its okay.
Just calm down.
Calm down.
YourJia.
Once an Indian woman is married to someone she dedicates her life to him.
She can never break that relationship and that's a fact.
Aditya...
Jia may not break this relationship but Karan Oberoi can.
Today I understood one thing.
Relation must be the bonding of hearts.
If there isn't any bonding then relation suffocates the person.
There will be no place for love there.
Anyway I don't like anything piecemeal.
I want everything completely my own.
Come, Jia.
You are free from every relation today.
Come, you are free.
Come with me please, Jia... come.
Karan, what did you do?
I broke a relation so that a bond becomes stronger.
But how can you...
How long, uncle?
How long should we sacrifice lives in the name of tradition?
Relationships are needed for life but life shouldn't depend on them.
My choice was correct.
But they are made for each other.
No, Mr. Oberoi!
They are meant for each other.
Wonder how many people reside in the whole world!
Different colours... different castes... different types...
Whereverthere are people there is one more thing...
No!
No!
I am not talking about crowds!
I am talking about relationships.
Mother-Father!
Brother-Sister!
Husband-Wife!
Or such relationships which have no name.
Then how are these relationships made?
What connects people in this world?
What is it that bonds us to each other?
Sentiment!
Yes it is sentiment that keeps us linked to each other.
Till this emotion is alive, our relationship is alive.
Our love is alive.
No one can teach you this emotion.
Except for life.
Hi, Rasik sir!
Catch!
Don't throw it like that.
It is a very sensitive device.
Sorry!
Sorry!
How is the car?
Excellent!
I really enjoyed the ride, sir.
Sign please, sir.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Where should I sign, on yourface?
Sorry, sir.
Sign here.
Then you should tell that.
Sorry, sir.
Now go!
There is no need to come to work from tomorrow.
Thank you, sir.
Good morning, Aditya.
- Good morning.
Surprising!
She said good morning to you.
Why don't they say that to me?
Why do these superfast girls or superfast cars...
Why it doesn't happen with me?
Don't you know?
Whether a girl or a car, we must pamperthem.
We must keep them with a lot of love.
Both need a lot of care and attention.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
This is general knowledge, sir.
Even a fool knows that.
You know what?
- What.
- What?
I have good news foryou.
- Tell me!
Tell me!
Follow me!
Tell me!
Please tell me!
Aditya!
Our company is going to launch a new car into the market.
Do you know we will be doing its marketing in entire India?
Oh, no!
I am finished.
No, you are not.
You are going to be my head.
I am ruined.
What ruined?
You are promoted.
Your salary is going to be increased.
Oh, no!
What is this?
You are going to Canada.

Now the time is five past six.
Don't know what Sonia will do to me now.
Wow!
Sonia looks gorgeous!
She looks very stylish today.
- She rocks.
Whose sister is she after all?
You know, she is a fashion designer.
You know, she understands fashion.
Hi, Tanya!
- Hi Sonia!
What does fashion mean to you?
Fashion is what I wear and others wear.
They are Just clothes.

Why are you removing your clothes?
If you want to pee, I'll stop the car.
You keep driving.
I don't want to pee.
I am Just changing clothes.

You didn't invite Aditya.
It would have been betterto invite him.

I think your son.
Today is his engagement with my daughter.
Where is your prince?
Call him.
Yes, please call him.
I too have elsewhere to go.
- Yes.
What are you doing?
Let me drive the car.
Oh!
I am...
I am sorry.
You will kill me.
He is a goner!
I don't know why Aditya is getting so late.
You know aunty, had this been a love marriage he would never be late.
Shut up, rascal!
Happy, listen to this.
- Tell me.
- Are you enjoying?
Did you call Adi or not?
- Call Adi?
- Please call.
Please call quickly.
I too have elsewhere to go.
Get out fast!
Go!

Nothing!
The cartook the shoe.
- The cartook the shoe!
Adi, where were you?
Since when we are waiting foryou.
- Dad, the shoe...
Adi, does anyone do such a thing on such a day!
- Mother...
Adi!
Have some shame!
- Granny, what are you doing...
I have applied gel on my hair.
Don't spoil his hair.
- Really?
See this!
Hey!
Who is this?
I am not hitting him, I am making him wear it.
Dad!
Dad, he is my boss.
- He is your boss?
Sorry.
Let me explain to you...

Canada?
But why?
I will tell it...
I'll tell them.
I got a promotion.
Really!

- This is very good news.
You got a promotion and you didn't even tell us.
I too learnt it Just now.
Wow!
This is wonderful news.
And that too on engagement day.

Thank you.
Great!
I'm so happy.
How lucky is Sonia for Adi?
- Absolutely!

You know, these traditions are indeed fabulous.
Two families come closer in the name of uniting two people.
They share little Joys.
IJust love it.
IJust love traditional marriage.
I don't think so.
I think it is a waste of time money and energy.
It is we who are getting married.
Then why are we calling ourfriends and relatives and feeding them?
One must be practical in life.
I don't care fortraditions.
Everybody has his own opinion.
Yes.
Are you tired?
- Not much.
So...
- So?
Shall I leave?
- Ok.
Give me a kiss.
- What!
?
Give me a goodnight kiss.
Is this some time for a kiss?
There isn't a time for a kiss.
One has to be in the mood for it.
You have to be romantic.
Give me a kiss.
Aditya, someone might see.
Who is going to see us at 3.30 am?
And I've got the license too.
We Just got engaged...
you are my fiancée.
Please give me a kiss.
Just grow up!
Why... grown ups don't take kisses?
Tanya.
Sonia, why don't you give Aditya what he asked?
If you can't do it, I will do it.
Daddy too is ready in the room.
And he said that mom is ready too.
And for God's sake tell him to take the hand off the speaker phone.
It is 3.30 am in the morning.
Ridiculous that you are fighting over a kiss.
C'mon give him a kiss.
Don't know... they are engaged and then too for a kiss...
Good night.
- Good night.
Are we engaged?
- What do you mean?
Are we really engaged?
Grow up, Adi.
What are you saying?
I can't really believe this.
We are really engaged.
O madam, please convince him you are engaged.
Till he is not convinced, he will not let anyone sleep.
Can't believe!
- Go to sleep.
Gavin
-Yeah!
What kind of smell is this?
Stinking!
Excuse me please.
- Yes sir.
What kind of smell is this?
I will check out.
It is really stinking.
It must surely be some Indian.
- What happened?
They should know.
These days everything is available everywhere but they still move around with shop loads.
Disgusting!
- Disgusting!
Excuse me, sir.
Is this your bag?
How happy would your sister be that you are going to Canada!
Am I going to take all this luggage?
You aren't going to carry it on your head.
You are going by plane.
I won't take it.
Take it without saying a word.
It is our love.
Add a few more kilos of love!
These children!
How cute are they when they cry!
But they don't like us sleeping.
I can't understand at all why these people travel with such little children.
As if you would leave your kids behind!
Of course!
Since we are talking about it, we should make it clear.
I think we shouldn't think about kids for 5-6 years after marriage.
This is the time for our careers.
And I don't think we are ready for kids.
At least I'm not.
Sonia.
- Yes.
Sonia, this is the passport and ticket.
- Ok.
And call up Simran when you reach Paris.
Ok, I'll do it.
- Ok.
But you don't forget your workouts.
I hate unfit people and this T-Shirt looks cool on you.
I'll get you some more.
- Ok, thank you.
Ok, I'll leave then.
And listen...
Have a safe flight and take care.
I'll do that.
Bye!
You too take care, Aditya.
Uncle!
- Hey Dumpy.
What is this, uncle?
I sent you six emails.
You didn't reply even to one.
I was busy with my female and couldn't respond to your email.
Ok, sorry.
Come soon.
- There they are.
Adi!
- Uncle!
- Hey!
You are looking so young.
Wait!
Wait!
- My God I was scared!
How weak he has become, isn't it Raabi!
True!
Raabi has become really weak.
Weak... thank you.
Did you hear?
I've become weak.
Very funny.
How is Sonia?
They all look good before marriage.
Correct!
- Right!
Absolutely right.
Correct?
- No... wrong!
Absolutely wrong!
I mean Adi is wrong.
My brother is wrong?
That's me.
- Yeah.
My luggage.
- Ok.
Both you brother and sister are right.
I am wrong.
No need to explain to me.
- Listen to me.
Stop fighting.
How dare you touch my luggage!
- Sister.
- This is my luggage.
Leave it to me, Adi.
I know how to deal with these people.
Sister, he is from my company.
- I will call the police.
Sister, he is from my company.
What are you doing?
You are hitting him.
What will he think?
He's come to pick me.
He came to pick you?
Then who did we come here for?
You've indeed come for me.
But he is from my company.
He came to pick me up.
They've booked an apartment for me.
I am in contract with them.
Why don't you understand?
Why don't you explain it to her?
He is right.
I know he is right.
- Then what was the need to come here?
You could have got trained in Mumbai!
Sister, do you think that I like staying away from you?
- Huh!
I will come over in the weekends.
Every Sunday.
We will enjoy ourselves.
We will go for picnics.
We will go for lunches and parties... everything.
C'mon sis... c'mon!
Try to understand, please.
Hey man, why are you staring at me?
Take all this stuff.
- What did you say?
Take the luggage and take him also.
- Ok, c'mon.
I'll meet you overthe weekend.
Mom sent pickle foryou.
I'll get that too.
- It's ok.
So you seem like quite a family man.
Ya, unfortunately I've to stay alone.
No... you have a roommate.
- A roommate!
?
Welcome...
I am Nawab Sharif.
I am a gentleman only by name and not by actions.
I am from Pakistan.
Any problems?
Aditya Malhotra.
- Great!
Nice meeting you.
- I too feel great to meet you.
Welcome Aditya, welcome to Canada.
Thank you, sir.
- Let me show you.
- Sure, sir.
You know we have the biggest dealership in Canada.
Look at our showroom.
The best showroom ever in Canada.
Aditya, you want to test drive?
Let's go ahead.
Take it easy.
Come on Nawab!
Oh boy!
Aditya, you drive well.
- Thank you.
Buddy, was this a test drive or were you taking revenge against me forthe Kargil war?
Adi!
You know what I was thinking?
- Sir!
Why don't you represent us in cross country rally?
I would love to do that, sir.
- O beautiful!
Hang on.
- Oh!
Sorry.
If you take your hand off the button...
the lift will move.
- Sorry!
- Its alright.
Linda!
- Daddy!
Oh!
FBI has done its Job.
Right... right...
- No, left...
left...
Are you going out?
- No, why?
Then why are you looking like a Christmas tree?
Adi!
Eat the snacks.
Mom, what are you doing?
- It is Nawab's peg.
I know that it is liquor.
It is not a milk drinking age.
Kitty, aunty cannot hear well.
But granny can see quite well.
Mama!
I am gone.
It is the last chance to save the princess.
- Excuse me.
How does this start?
It is paused.
If you take your hand off the button it will play.
'Lf you take your hand off the button...
the lift will move.
- Sorry!
'
Left...
left...
Right... right...
Yes, yes, I am trying to save it.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh, my cake!
- What?
I am really sorry.
I didn't realise I was Just walking and I will Just clean it up.
What are you doing?
It's okay.
I am really sorry.
My apartment is there.
You can clean up the mess there.
Come!
No, its okay.
Thank you.
I'll manage.
Are you sure?
- Yeah!
- Are you sure?
Hey!
Nice dress!
Get it from the bakery shop.
Sorry, it is all because of me.
My offer is still open... please!
You look beautiful!
It is good that you accepted my advice.
Those children made a cake shop of you.
Will you have cream biscuits?
No, I am getting late.
I've got to be leaving.
Will you drink something?
- No.
Coke?
- No!
Orange Juice?
- No!
Tomato Juice?
- This is tomato ketchup.
Why do you always say no?
- Nothing like that.
You Just said no.
Your cake fell down because of me.
And I was thinking that your clothes got spoilt because of me.
You reduced my guilt by saying that.
Why feel guilty?
It was an accident.
I don't think so.
I think that whatever happens is all a master plan.
It's all destiny.
What do you think?
No.
Suppose that you get run over by a bus tomorrow.
Ya... thanks why not?
I said suppose... it will be because you weren't watchful.
It would not be because of a master plan.
So you mean to say that your coming to this apartment is not destiny?
Right?
No.
It is because we both took our eyes off the path.
That's why we bumped into each other.
But we both taking our eyes off and that too at this time...
Don't you think so?
That's destiny.
May be!
Anyway thanks for everything.
I must be going now.
Okay.
- Bye!
Are you sure you don't want to drink?
- No.
Thank you.
Bye!
O my God!
I am sorry.
The door was actually open.
I left my bag.
Never mind.
Go and take your bag.
Are you okay?
- Absolutely!
Go!
Your nose?
- Destiny!
Go!
- Really sorry.
Take this.
What is this for?
Oh, thank you.
Take care of yourself.
She's back.
-What brother?
Wow!
Yes, I got the message.
Actually I was busy.
Never mind!
At least we are now talking.
I am trying to be busy.
Shopping is so boring sometimes.
Thank God!
I can never handle shopping.
I'm overloaded with work.
Some people are so lucky.
They avoid all their duties in the name of work.
Excuse me, I am not giving any excuse.
Actually I was very busy.
I don't know how truthful you are.
But your sister is waiting here with a sword in hand.
What are you saying!
?
- Ho... ho... well!
You fool, where are you speaking from?
I am speaking from my mouth.
Very funny!
I was cooking your favourites since three days.
Come soon or I'll never talk to you in this life.
So you are now threatening me.
I don't know why I don't get such threats.
Very funny!
It's not funny any more, Jennifer.
You don't understand.
Shopping alone like this...
and Karan is Just not bothered.
C'mon Jia!
Don't sound so low.
Is there any girl in this world who is bored of shopping?
And that too when she is shopping for her marriage.
- Excuse me, please sign this.
I tell you what let's change places.
I'll do the shopping foryou and you become the PAto Karan.
At least you'll get closerto yourfiancée.
What do you say?
- Oh, yeah!
Okay... take care.
- You too.
Oh, I am sorry.
- Its okay.
Oops!
- Sorry...
I...
You?
Twice!
I think we should learn to shake hands.
Aditya Malhotra!
- Jia...
Jia Yashvardhan!
What a unique name!
Jia...
Jia Yashvardhan!
Very nice!
Not twice.
Just Jia.
It's ok.
Thanks.
Let me help you.
- No... really it's fine.
There must be some punishment for bumping in.
Tell me one thing.
Whenever I meet you why do you carry so many bags?
Do you do smuggling?
No!
Shopping!
I mean what do you do besides shopping?
IJust keep shopping on various pretexts.
Oh, nice Job!
And you.
And what do you do?
Are you asking me what I do besides bumping into you?
Do you never get serious?
I would be in a hospital if I became serious.
But not going around with you in a mall.
I like your smile.
- Thanks.
You didn't tell me what you do.
I work hard.
I help people.
I bump into them, pick up their bags and drop them to their vehicles.
That's my Job.
Please pick up our bags too.
Ghuggi...
Ghuggi...
I am coming.
How are you?
- I am fine.
What are you doing here?
- I am getting trained.
Do you need training even forthis Job?
Didn't you get trained in college?
Greetings!
- Greetings!
We are not friends Just from happy days.
We are friends even before that.
Sis-in-law!
- Sis-in-law?
You used to have a girl friend at college.
What's her name?
Pammi!
- Yes, Pammi!
He had a girl friend in college.
What happened to her?
Now she is not my girl friend.
Thank God!
You are lucky that she is not your girl friend.
What do you mean?
Except you and a few other guys she had affairs with everyone else in college.
She is...
She is my wife now.
She is beautiful... she is nice...
she was very good... she was...
Excuse me!
- Ghuggi!
Ghuggi!
You should not have spoken like that.
I was Just Joking.
Unnecessarily he got angry.
But the matter became serious.
Aditya!
ParamJeet?
Yes, ParamJeet...
Pammi!
What do you think of yourself?
Just shooting off your mouth!
When did you see me roaming with other guys?
Sis-in-law!
- Sis-in-law!
?
Now you are giving me respect.
What happened to all that when you maligned me in front of Sardar-Ji?
Sis-in-law!
I was Just Joking.
It takes Just a minute to break a relation.
But takes a life time building them.
And you...
Where has Sardar-Ji gone?
Sardar-Ji!
I am sorry, sister.
I lost my brother.
I am sorry, brother, I lost my husband.
We are moments away from starting.
Can I have the mike?
I have to say few words.
Please, sir.
Please!
Stop her!
Hey stop!
Okay.
- No!
No!
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Hey!
I know this lady.
Where are you?
Please, my dear!
Don't do this to me.
Otherwise... otherwise I swear by you...
I will kill myself.
Where are you?
I say, where are you?
Sorry ladies and gentleman for interrupting your evening.
Today this lady who is standing beside me needs your help to reassure her husband what the meaning of true love is!
It's because of my ignorance I caused her husband to suspect, doubt and question his wife.
I know that you are listening to me.
You are so fortunate that you have got such a loving wife.
But you are unlucky that you don't have faith in her love.
How can anyone listen to stray words and doubt his love?
There is no room for doubt in love.
Where there is love there should only be love.
Only love!
You too cannot remain happy entertaining such doubt.
If anyone of you find him around please make him understand.
That it is not worth breaking the relationship for such small things.
This is his photograph.
Please, cameraman!
Can you zoom on it?
Okay.
- Okay.
Please, I beg all of you to spread the magic of love everywhere.
Whatever I said earlier was a Joke.
But whatever I said now is the truth.
That is the only truth.
Pammi!
Pammi!
You are one and I am one.
And we have God's blessings on us.
We both should embrace each othertightly.
And the one who releases the embrace first will be a deceiver.
Thank God, both of them united again.
'There is no room for doubt in love.'
'Where there is love there should only be love.
Only love!
'
Hello!
- Hello, Jia!
How are you?
Jenny!
Where is Karan?
He is in meeting as usual.
It's a big business deal.
How romantic!
Oh, come on Jia!
Just think from his side.
He wants to buy all the happiness in this world foryou.
Happiness cannot be bought, Jenny.
He promised me to come with me to shop forthe marriage.
You know... that he never bought anything else except factories and shares?
I know.
Karan loves you a lot, Jia.
But the problem is he doesn't know how to express it.
Anyway, tell me what shopping you did today.
I bought a book for Karan.
40 Landscapes...
Sports cars?
40 Landscapes.
Wow!

What?
- What are you thinking?
Tell me something, Nawab.
Did your God make only one woman for every man?
Buddy!
He made two girls for me.
First one came to my life and took away all my money.
The second one came and saw that I didn't have any money.
So she took my heart and went away.
She didn't return it till now.
Now I will sell this remaining body to go to Pakistan.
Hey, what can I get foryou?
Forthe moment same stuff continue.
And you, sir?
- What?
He will have that girl.
The one in pink.
Its totally full, ma'am.
- Oh I see.
I am afraid we can't serve dishes that are out of our kitchen.
No.
I am okay with this.
Thank you.
You have to wait for 15 minutes.
Are you still thinking?
No, buddy.
Are you mad?
Okay...
I'm Just coming!
Where are you going?
- To the washroom.
I'll wait here then.

Pay the bill.

Okay, why don't you Join me?
Are you sure?
- Yes, sure.
Okay.
- Come.
So, this is ourthird unscheduled meeting.

Is this an accident or a coincidence?
I'll still say that it's destiny.
Hey!
enjoy yourself.
It's our 25th wedding anniversary.
Congratulations...
- Thanks!
Indian?
- Yes, of course!
You both look so good together.
How many years it is since you are married?
No... no, we are not married.
Then when are you getting married?
Oh, no!
No...
Actually I am already engaged.
My wedding is on September 25th.
I see!
And mine is in October.
Exactly 15 days after her marriage.
Actually we are...
we are Just friends.
Oh, that's more important.
Normally my guess never goes wrong.
I don't know how that happened this time.
Anyway come on, let's dance.
What is it that keeps them together even after so many years of marriage?
Feelings.
- Feelings?
Afeeling is Just what unites us.
Our relationship is alive so long as this feeling is alive.
Our love too is alive because of that.
The day when this feeling...
Oh, it is very cold today.
Yes, it's cold.
Quite chilly!
Yes, you shouldn't have come out.
I am afraid you might catch a cold.
You want my Jacket?
No.
Its okay.
Taxi...
I don't think any taxi will stop.
It is very late.
If you want I will come with you to the hotel.
If you want.
No, it's okay.
I will manage.
Are you sure?
- Yes.
Okay.

Shall we go together?
- Sure!
See this.

See what's written here.
- Oh!
John loves SuJi, Mr. And Mrs. Smith, forthe one I love...
It feels good when the names of two people in love are written.
Yes, some lovers don't want to get separated.
I neverthought that we would meet like this in this unknown country.
You won't let anyone remain a stranger.
- Yes.
Why do people whistle?
People passing by will stop.
Come on!
Hotel Sheraton.
- Yes sir.
By sitting on this chariot I remembered Marine drive.
Did you ever go to Mumbai?
What do you mean...
I am from Mumbai.
And that too from Marine drive!
Don't tell me!
Last year we shifted to Bandra.
I too stay at Marine drive.
Do you know the restaurant Barista?
Just behind it.
No way.
I used to go there all the time.
And my favourite order was French vanilla...
What a small world!
We may have crossed each other a thousand times.
I don't think so.
- Why?
If I ever crossed you, I would have stood still.
I wouldn't still be moving.
Stop!
- Yes.
Jia!
- I have to go now.
Give me the money.
Give me the money...
Let me go...
Let me go...
Hey... hey.
Don't...

You want the money...

I will give you money.
Okay?
Don't hurt her.
Okay.
Yes, there is a lot of money.
Here, c'mon take it.
Don't hurt her!
Don't hurt her!
Hey, take... don't do that...
I told you don't hurt her.
Aditya!
Guys!
C'mon let's go.
The cops are coming.
The cops are coming.
It's me... okay...

It's okay.
They have gone.
Don't cry.
Just take it easy.
They have all gone.
Stop it...
Just calm down...
please!
- Aditya!
Take it easy... take it easy.
They have gone.
We reached your hotel.
Had you not been there...
How is that possible?
I love to become superman.
How couldn't I come?
Bye!
- Bye!
'Lf I ever crossed you, I would have stood still.'
'I wouldn't still be moving.'
Hello!
- Aditya!
Jia, is that you?
Is everything okay?
Yes.
I don't know why but I wanted to talk to you.
Sleep now, Jia.
It is very late in the night.
We can talk tomorrow morning.
Good night!
Good night!
I don't know why nothing works over here.
Sir, will you have some coffee?
Except forthis bloody coffee machine!
Look guys, we have one of the best dealership over here.
We have the best cars to sell.
- Right.
But we don't sell the most.
Why?
Yes, Mr. Sharif!
Why are you clapping for now?
Sir, because the growth of the company...
Nothing grows here except your hair.
And look at the cheap colour as well.
And what about tomorrow's rally?
Are you ready forthat?
Sir!
We are trying our level best.
I hope so everything goes well tomorrow.
Are you stupid, shut up?
The boss' engine is very hot.
Buddy, even our engine is hot since two days.
Hi!
- Hi!
Bye!
What wrong, Aditya?
I've come to meet you.
Yes, but I can't meet you now.
And my boss is very angry right now.
This vehicle is a superb one.
What are you doing?
Why are you pushing me?
I've come to kidnap you.
Let's go for lunch.
Let's do one thing.
I'll resign and come.
Then we'll go.
Resign!
?
Before my boss throws me out I'll come out on my own.
What do you think?
Boss!
Do you speak Hindi?
Yes, very well.
Show me this car.
And ya... you are right...
very nice selection, ma'am.
Let me help you.
Okay, you resign and come.
I'll wait.
Sir!
Excuse me!
What happened?
Won't you resign?
It is frustration here and celebration at night.
Where is the celebration?
It is my nephew's birthday.
Look straight.
We have to go to the birthday party.
What will I do there?
They have called a few Jokers.
But they haven't turned up.
I thought I'll take you along.
- Okay.
Yeah, that's right.
You like it.
Done.
- Done, sir.
Done!
Did you like the car?
- Yes, I liked it.
Done!
- Done!
See you in the evening.
- Done!
They think I am a fool.
Hey, Dumpy!
Happy birthday.
I am late because of your uncle.
I'll leave.
- Let's go.
Uncle!
- How are you?
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
She is Jia...
birthday boy Dumpy.
Happy birthday, Dumpy.
- Thank you.
Uncle, where did you get this parrot from?
Keep quiet.
Uncle!
The bird is very cute.
Does she kiss or not?
Have some shame.
Have some shame.
What is your age?
She has not even embraced me.
You are mad.
Stop your ranting.
You don't even have manners.
If not you make her kiss me.
You will be beaten along with your uncle.
What's he saying?
Are you talking about him?
- Ya...
He is saying in punjabi that his mother is very angry with us because we came very late.
And this boy speaks a lot but his granny is hard of hearing.
Ourfamily is very weird.
So let's go inside and see what will happen to us.
Let's go in.
- Come on.
I say, have some more.
- What are you doing?
Not a cool drink, get me some wine.
No!
No, we are not allowed to serve.
Raabi!
Come on, don't be embarrassed.
Its okay.
Hi, everybody!
Hello!
- Hi.
Why is everyone looking at me like that?
It is not their mistake.
I think they hate me.
I won't let it happen.
Why are you looking like that?
She is my friend.
Can't I bring my friend to a party?
She is Jia...
Jia...
Jia Yashvardhan.
- Yes!
Yes!
She is my sister.
She is always angry.
IJust came along to wish Dumpy on his birthday.
You don't mind.
No!
No!
Not at all...
not at all...
Look, mom...
What Jia got for me...
Isn't it cool?
Thank you so much... so sweet!
Welcome... welcome...
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Here comes your guest.
They may be your guests.
Not ours.
Why do you get angry?
Okay, sister.
I am sorry for being late.
We are late because she spent time in make-up.
Make-up!
?
I mean, explain it to her.
She always gets angry.
That is her way of showing love.
Stop it.
It is enough.
Love can never be enough.
- The Rakhi festival is about to come.
So, I think she needs a lump sum amount.
Adi, you too.
Oh!
I don't get it even if I ask.
Never mind!
Get the Rakhi tied and you too will get it.
Rabbi... what a nice song...
Jia, give me that curry.
- Yes.
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
- We are Just going to the wash room.
Come on soon before the work is done.
Raabi!
- What, mom?
How come all three guys want to shit together?
He brought us to some party.
Hi, Pammi!
She was in such a good mood.
She said that we should stay in a hotel.
I was a fool to reject such a hot offerfrom my wife and come to this cold party.
No, buddy!
You got an offerfrom your wife.
But I left an offer from another's wife.
Here there is neither liquor nor beautiful women.
Do something.
What can I do?
All of them are bro-in-law's friends.
They are all behaving like English men.
I'll teach a lesson to these English men.
One minute!
One minute!
Now it will be interesting.
What are you doing, will you drink?
This is English stuff.
If everyone consumes it a little the true nature will come out.
You fool!
Everyone drinks Juice.
- Take it.
This is the age of adulteration.
We'll mix it a little in the Juice and no one will come to know.
What a good plan!
We have the same ideas on both sides of the border.
Oh my gosh!
My leg!
My son has a hotel at the top of the restaurant.
Shall I have the room opened?
Aunty!
We were discussing...
you misunderstood us.
Were you kissing?
Not kissing, aunty.
We were discussing.
There is a conference hall too above.
Go and discuss there.
Oh, my... disgusting people...
Aunty!
You misunderstood us.
Now we will mix in all the drinks.
Get the bottle.
What are you doing?
Drink it and see.
- How much will you make me drink?
C'mon darling!
It is plain Juice.
Give it to mom also.
No.
This is sweet and she will get sugar complaint.
Nothing will happen in one glass.
Give it.
As you wish.
The Juice is okay foryou, mom.
It is not wine.
Take it.
One more.
No.
You have diabetes... please...
Is this Juice your daddy's?
No, it is orange Juice.
What will I lose?
Wait... one more.
One more.
- Excuse me.

Your uncle is a very nice man.
- I know.
But you are nicerthan him.
- I know that too.
Will you marry me?
- No, I've already promised someone else.
Oh!
You too have the same problem.
But we can be friends, right?
- Okay.
Dumpy!
Don't you want a kiss from this lovely bird?
You can kiss, isn't it?
- Yes!
That's it!
I didn't feel bad at all.
Don't be embarrassed.
Stop, I am not embarrassed.
Rather I am happy that you speak punjabi so well.
You fitted so well in the family.
By the way where did you learn punjabi?
My mothertongue is PunJabi.
- No way.
Yashvardhan are PunJabis.
I would not have guessed that.
Dumpy is very cute.
He loves you a lot.
You too.
Thanks for being so nice to him.
It is I who has to thank.
Only today I learnt what relations are and what family is.
I have laughed so much that my eyes are filled with tears.
Your hotel has come.
Come on, what happened?
Nothing!
You know, Aditya...
what is the most beautiful moment in my day?
- What is it?
When I come to meet you.
And do you know what the worst moment in my day is?
It is when I go away after meeting you.
But why do these moments come together?
I don't understand.
I'll leave.
Give me a ring.
- What?
Give me a ring.
- Ring!
?
On phone!
- Okay.
Call me.
- Take care!
You take care too.
I'll take care of my thoughts too.
Hi, best of luck.
Yes, I desperately need that.
Where is Nawab?
- Overthere.
What happened to him?
Nothing!
I warned him last night not to over eat.
But he didn't listen to me.
Now he has loose motions.
He is going to the toilet repeatedly.
I don't know what to do.
What will happen now?
Nothing.
We lost the race even before it started.
I don't have a navigator.
I'll go and tell those people that I don't have a navigator and so I can't participate.
1, 2, 3, 4,
Aditya!
- What happened?
I can try.
Can you clean the car?
- I can try.
I think your luck is working.
Are you okay?
- Yeah!
Nice parking.
Sorry, I dozed off.
What will happen now?
Nothing!
Now we have to wait till morning.
What else?
Till morning?
- Yes.
What will we do till morning?
You sleep here and I here.
Because these doors won't open now.
We are covered with snow all over.
We'll go to sleep.
What else?
Good night.
I can't sleep.
You know I used to have the same problem in childhood.
I would not get to sleep.
Then my mother would say that if you can't sleep then you must think of such a place where you want to go.
And close your eyes.
Gradually you'll get to sleep.
Yeah, believe me.
I am telling you the truth.
Some times I used to think and go into space.
It is amazing.
Oh, that's not possible.
It is.
I am telling you.
It's a fact.
You don't believe me?
Okay, let us try once and see.
Close your eyes.
We'll... try... come on...
Stop looking here...
come on... come on...
Close your eyes.
Jia, where are you?
Rome, Spanish steps...
It's so beautiful.
Where are you?
In the heaven of Kashmir...
lovely.
I always wanted to see Kashmir.
Hold my hands and see how tall the mountains are.
How does it feel from here?
What happened?
I am scared of heights.
See, Jia.
Only after reaching heights in life can we see new paths.
And by travelling on those paths we can attain new goals.
What about the relations that we kept all along?
In life some relationships exist which we know but don't want to tell ourselves.
But the heart inside understands everything.
It knows everything.
The heart shows dreams which can never become true.
The distance between dreams and reality is the wink of an eye.
It is a dream when the eye is closed and reality when it is open.
It is not so easy, Aditya.
Why not?
Come on, dare to dream.
I am scared that I'll get lost.
I'll see that you won't get lost.
Trust me.
Give me your hand.
Now close your eyes and see that your dreams are waiting foryou.

Yes?
- Actually it is...
- Room service, sir.
Your hotel knows that I'm not to be disturbed.
Actually I called him.
Your uniform?
Sir, it was the last call of the shift.
I already changed my clothes.
I am sorry about that, sir.
That's being very unprofessional.
You know I can get you sacked forthat.
Sorry sir.

- Okay, not bad.
Welcome, Mr. Oberoi.
- Hello.
How are you sir?
Always the best.
You want a picture?
Gentlemen, he is the son of my friend.
He has grown up in front of me.
Afterthe unfortunate death of Mr. And Mrs. Oberoi the way he managed the business it's amazing!
Mr. Oberoi, your marriage and this project...
won't there be a clash?
It's a merger it is not a clash.
You know each other for quite some time what do you like about Karan?
Jia, cut the list short.
Mr. Oberoi how do you classify your marriage, love or arranged?
Of course love!
I love her and she loves me.
Karan, please!
- Why?
What happened?
I don't like doing it forthe photos.
Look honey, I am Karan Oberoi.
Whatever I do, they're bound to take pictures.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.
But they are waiting for you inside.

I am sorry.
You must be Joking.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
C'mon let's go.

I am Just observing that Karan is not marrying me.
He is Just doing a take-over.
It is betterthat you make it a habit.
Your Pizza, sir.
Aah... thank God you are here.
I am very hungry.

I am thinking about what to say.
Won't you ask me to come in?
Sorry!
Please come in.
Thank you.
I like this anger of yours.
Actually what happened that day is...
That is past.
You are completely wet.
Why don't you go and change?
Okay.
Thank you.
This is yours.
Why isn't everyone like you, Aditya?
You understand everything without me saying anything.
Silence is also strange.
If it enters a relationship then it turns into suffocation.
Coffee?
- Thank you!
My father used to talk to everyone except to my mother.
Dad had only a physical relation with my mother.
He used to beat her and she bore it all silently.
Mom used to love dad a lot.
People say that love can change anyone.
But it couldn't change my dad.
Even today people think that my mom committed suicide.
But I know that dad's silence killed her.
My father killed her.
His indifference killed her.
The weather outside is very bad.
It is betterthat you stay here tonight.
It is said that the sunlight after a rain will be beautiful.
Do you like coffee cold?
- No.
Then drink it hot.
Cheers!
Who is it?
- There is a girl in the room upstairs.
Don't you think you must do something?
Nawab!
She is very worried.
I know that.
You can make herforget her worries.
It cannot be done by sleeping here.
You have to go upstairs.
Shut up!
Go and sleep, Nawab.
Please go upstairs, buddy.
Please go.
It is very late in the night, Nawab.
I am telling you.
Please think again.
I don't want to speak to you.
Oh, sorry.
No!
No, Jia!
I didn't say that to you.
Out!
No!
Not you.
I am telling that to Nawab.
There he goes behind you.
I couldn't sleep.
That is why...
I too couldn't sleep.
That is why I am watching the movie.
Which movie is this?
Junglee!
Hey, Shammi Kapoor!
- He is my favourite.
'That means you love someone.'
'Do you know when you love someone the confusion in your heart will increase.'
'You cannot understand my feelings.'
'I love you a lot!
I love you a lot.'
How easily they said 'I love you.'
Popcorn?
I wish it was so easy.
- I wish it was so easy.
"Alas!
What should I do?"
I love this song.
IJust love the way he dances in this.
Shammi Kapoor man, he's God.
I wish I could dance like him.
Then we can try.
It shouldn't be difficult.
Come on, let's try.
- No!
No!
It will be fun.
It will be really fun.
Come on!
Come on, get up.
"Alas!
What should I do?"
The DVD got stuck.
- Yes.
I will forward it.
It would have been nice if we could forward life too.
Then the fun of living will go away.
But we can know which relationships last life long and which are short-lived.
Would you like to spend your life with me?
"I will be thankful to you if you let me tell you my feelings."
"I am in love with you...
let me take shelter in your eyes."
"I will be thankful to you if you let me tell you my feelings."
"I am in love with you...

"I will be thankful to you..."
It is morning.
Seems like you didn't sleep all night.
I was waiting foryour reply.
Let me think over it.
The wait is only till 6 pm tomorrow.
Same restaurant.
I can't come at 6... because I'll reach there by 5.30
Hi... good morning.
- Hi... good morning
So early in the morning.
Where are you coming from?
A morning walk.
A morning walk or... who is it?
Who?
- You know it.
C'mon Jia, out with it.
His name is Aditya...
- And?
He too is from India.
We met by sheer coincidence and that became my destiny.
I don't even know how it all happened.
I can't... do you know what you are saying, Jia?
I know Just one thing.
That he is the one for me.
He is so loving... he is so caring...
and he is so funny.
He is so friendly and caring.
And the most important thing is that when he is with me he is Just with me.
He makes me come alive.
I can see that.
But you are forgetting that you are Jia Yashvardhan and shall be Jia Oberoi.
These two names and their status is much greater than your life and every happiness of yours.
I think that you don't know about Karan Oberoi.
You rememberthat in your engagement party the editor of a national newspaper got drunk and misbehaved with you in front of the entire press.
Yes, but I did forgive him.
What you don't know is that Just a week later that editor was killed in an accident and all the offices of that paper were gutted by fire.
Karan Oberoi neverforgives.
When he loves you... he owns you.
I don't care, Jenny.
IJust don't care.
All this mattered till I didn't meet this one.
You don't know him.
He is Just like that.
Hi, sweetheart.
Talking about me?
It means you are madly in love Just like me.
Angry?
I am sorry.
I know that I was very busy with the delegates last night.
But what can I do?
Everybody wants a piece of Karan Oberoi and I'm sure I must have ignored you.
But I promise you.
I swear on anyone this will never happen again.
Now smile... smile...
Excuse me, sir.
The press are here forthe interview.
They are waiting downstairs.
Sorry Jia.
Can't get on the bad side of press.
I'll return soon.
Nice shopping, Jia.
Doesn't the size look a bit odd?
But it's not looking bad.
Actually very bad.
See only those dreams that you are allowed to.
Oryou'll have hard times.
Herfather is responsible for her mother's death.
She faced many troubles in her life.
Such a father should be dragged on to streets...
Nawab, she is so lonely you know.
Lonely?
Why will she be when you are there?
I want to see her happy.
That's all.
I saw anotherJia inside her.
I am afraid that she may face trouble because of me.
We shouldn't be afraid of troubles.
We should face them.
I am going for a Jog.

Hello, sir!
- What's the time?
- 5.30.
Thank you.
Hi... sugar.
Karan... you?
Here?
Shouldn't I be here?
- No, I mean...
- Some wine?
Thanks!
I thought of giving you a surprise.
But you surprised me.
I don't know why, Jia.
The more I see you the more I find you beautiful... gorgeous, stunning...
There is some strange intoxication in yourfragrance.
Why did you do this...
why did you do this to me?
Karan!
What are you saying?
I don't understand.
You know who you are to me.
Ya... yourfiancé...
My fiancé.
My fiancé, yes you are going to be my wife.
My wife by practice and not by law.
So you must have same respect for me which every wife should have for her husband.
I have a right on your every breath and thought.
Moreover I don't like it piecemeal.
Is that clear...
Good...
Excuse me...
Dad!
What is this?
What is this...
What is this?
You accused me of killing your mother.
That too in front of some stranger.
They are trash!
See how they ruined our prestige forthe sake of money.
Dad I was...
- Enough is enough.
Jennifer, book us on the next flight.
We are going back to India right now.
Its okay.
Its okay.
Excuse me, Jia Yashvardhan, room no 1204.
Is she in her room?
No, sir.
There is no one.
They left forthe airport.
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
We have time.
Go and freshen up.
Go!
Jia!
What's happening, Jia?
Where are you going?
I am talking...
I am talking to you.
Where are you going?
Who the hell are you?
Who are you to me?
Why should I tell you?
So that you can cash on my emotions again?
Cash!
?
You should have told me if you wanted money.
My father is a very rich man.
You would have got more money than this.
What!
?
- Yes.
I told you the things that I was afraid to say to myself.
Because I had faith in you.
More than I have on myself.
But you betrayed me...
Jia... what are you trying to say?
Read this... read it...
Are you okay?
- Ya... fine...
I didn't get this written.
I didn't tell it.
Believe me.
No...
I will never believe anyone from now.
I hate you.
I hate the moments I spent with you.
And I hate myself for having a relationship with you.
Jia...
Jia...
Jia.
No...
you cannot go leaving me...
Jia, I love you.
Believe me.
Trust me I can't live without you... trust me.
Don't ask anyone to trust you in future.

I told Simran not to tell you.
She spoilt my surprise.
Anyway I am so happy to see you.
Me too.
I am very happy too.
You didn't tell us about your shows.
How did they go?
Fantastic!
They were so successful that there was no end to buyers' inquiries.
And guys, I'm soon going to be a brand name.
Give me a five forthat!
- You are rocking Sonia!
Sonia, what it means is...
You have to move around because of your profession sometimes to Paris and sometimes to London.
How will you both manage after marriage?
We did it till now and will do it in future too.
What do you say, Aditya?
See, he understands me.
He knows that only lucky people get such opportunities.
And I don't want to lose this opportunity at any cost.
You know I worked really hard forthis.
What is the need to wearthis?
Anyway you look like your mother.
Very funny!
He looks so handsome!
Now I'll scare grandma.
Why are you silent and dull?
What happened, Adi?
Nothing.
I know...
I know that Sonia came to spend a little time.
But she came foryou only.
And we are not leaving her alone.
Sonia, you are free to go.
Did you miss me?
You might have remembered me a little bit.
No?
It is very good that you didn't remember me.
But this time I missed you.
Initially I used to think that you are my desire and career is my necessity.
But being away from you I realised now that you are my necessity.
Now I am afraid of this distance.
Shall I tell you something, Adi?
One knows how close the other person to them is only when they move away from them.
I feel so complete with you.
I feel like flying.
I don't understand from where I should start this.
Why?
What happened?
Adi, I am the reason for what happened between Jia and you.
I am responsible for all this mess...
You trusted me and told me everything about Jia.
I told everything to my friend in a drunken state.
Adi, I...
I didn't mean it.
I...
Believe me, Adi!
I didn't know that there was also a Journalist sitting there.
He printed all that.
I am...
I'm not trying to Justify myself, Adi.
I know that it doesn't make any difference whether I was drunk or a Journalist was sitting at that place.
Actually, I have broken yourtrust.
I've taken away...
I've taken away your happiness from you.
It's okay.
Come on, it is getting late.
Let's go to work.
Please forgive me, Adi.
It's okay.
C'mon, forget it.

You wouldn't have come if it were not for Aditya's marriage.
Ask him.
He never brings me here.
I got tired asking him time and again.
Mom!
Whenever I apply for a visa they reject it saying that her photo doesn't match.
Very funny!
I mean how beautiful she became due to my love.
And who is this?
- I am Sharif.
That can be seen from yourface.
That's okay.
But who are you?
Madam, I am Nawab Sharif, a friend of Aditya.
I came here forthe marriage.
The marriage procession has come but where is the groom?
I am here, Bebe!
My son, why are you standing so far off?
Come here.
Come and embrace your Bebe.
Yes, I will.
My heart is contented!
Why are my son's eyes wet?
IJust remembered mother.
- Oh!
What are you doing, Adi?
Why don't you understand?
This path gives you only trouble and nothing else.
I know that I am wrong.
But I can't help it.
Man may be wrong.
But God is never wrong.
He pairs people with a plan.
And his decisions are our destiny.
Then what is love...
what is love?
Love is...
Nothing will come of your love but listen to one thing carefully.
If tears flow from your eyes then our happiness too will be lost.
Now see this!
- You, here?
She ate my ears!
Call from your Sonia.
Hi, Sonia!
I love you...
why isn't there any reaction?
The hottest girl in India is saying that she loves you.
But there is no reaction from you.
Are you angry that I didn't come to the airport?
No, Sonia.
That is not the matter.
I am so sorry, Adi.
I really wanted to come.
I am Just too busy.
It is Just like a mad house here.
- Mom!
It is such a big event.
It's Just too prestigious, Adi.
Will you please do what I want?
Tell me.
- Come here.
I want to meet you very much.
Watch while you come and bring the client's dress along.
It's totally ready.
You Just have to pick it up.
Sonia...
I...
- Please don't say no to my request.
Okay I will come.
I love you forthis...
thanks, see you at Marriot.
Bye... bye...
What is she saying?
She wants me to...
Meet her!
- Yes.
- Has called him to meet her!
Wash yourface before you go.
Your bride is waiting foryou.
If you all go I'll change my clothes.
I have seen you without clothes all your life.
And now you tell me.
He is now grown up.
Buddy, are you sure that this is the place?
It seems like a festival here.
I hope we don't have to take a ticket.
Yes, it's here.
- Yes.
Take it, buddy.
I am Aditya Malhotra...

Thanks forthe favour.
Jia, what's holding us now?
Yes...
Mr. Oberoi, this is Aditya, my fiancé.
He's brought the wedding dress and Mr. Karan Oberoi, the groom.
Congratulations!
I think I've seen you somewhere.
Anyway Jia, we are getting very late.
The guests are waiting for us downstairs.
They should not go away before the marriage is over.
Sonia, what are you doing?
How much time is it going to take?
Sir, Just 5 more minutes.
- Are you sure?
And she will be absolutely ready to take your breath away. - 100 percent.
Absolutely!
Jia, I'll come Just in a minute.

Both of you Join the party.

Come on!
It was so nice of Mr. Oberoi to invite you for his wedding.
Sonia, I can't come... you go.
C'mon...
Aditya, it is good to be seen in these parties.
Sonia, I don't know anyone there.
I feel very awkward...
I can't.
What awkward?
Can't you do even this for me?
Okay.
C'mon now.
I'll change and come.
Adi, that...
- Come on.
But...
- Come on, I know.
Lets go from here.
O God!
You really look beautiful.
Karan, can I ask you something?
- Yes.
What is it that will keep our relationship alive even afterthe marriage?
Of course, our marriage certificate.
Karan, I need to know it.
If you need to know it, then listen.
Your beautiful eyes...
your lips... your loveliness...
No, Karan... there has to be something else.
We can conduct this quiz later on.

No, no, it's really fine.
Okay.
No!
No, madam.
One shouldn't bump into others like this.
Listen to me.
A man shouldn't bump into others like this.
First he bumps and then they introduce each to the other.
Afterthat both of them fall in love.
Same this happened to Aditya.
My friend Aditya.
Aditya...
Jia all messed up.
Who's Aditya?
That one standing alone.
I feel sorry for him.
Yes, I know everything about Aditya.
No!
No, you don't know anything.
How can you know that?
I'll tell you.
Although it's too late.
But I'll tell you.
I was drunk and told everything to my friends.
You fell in love.
But your mistake is you loved him so much that a small misunderstanding appeared like a betrayal.
Why to talk about that, Jenny?
I am married now.
No, Jia...
Jia...
Jia...
We love only once in our life.
Second time it is Just adjustment.
Just adjustment.
I feel really bad foryou and really bad for Aditya.
Really bad.
Aditya...
Jia, you shouldn't come here.
If I didn't come at now...
I would never be able to forgive myself.
Bygones are bygones.
Forget them.
IJust want to see you happy.
I will try if you want it.
Good...
I must go now.
If we meet again someday in our life...
No.
No, that will not happen.
That will not happen...
I told myself that the time I spent with you are the best moments of my life.
I will keep the memories of those moments carefully in my heart.
They are going to be with me...
Okay...
Listen!
Will you give me one chance?
So that I can Just feel those moments of closeness again?
Jia Oberoi
Aditya Malhotra...
I will always rememberyou.
I will always rememberyou.
Will you always stay with me?
I will always keep you with me.
But will you come occasionally to carry my shopping bags?
You have good sense of humour.
Your smile is very bad.
- I know.
So, he is Aditya, whom you gave your heart too.
No.
You love him.
There are many faces of love, Karan.
But now you are everything to me.
But, I saw for myself...
I saw you hugging him.
That was a weak moment in my life.
But believe me, I am yours and only yours.
I see...
I see...
Can you look at me Just once the way you look at him?
Can you?
Karan Oberoi!
You don't know who Karan Oberoi is...
You are lucky...
you are still alive...
Jia is innocent.
Who are you to say that?
Because of you...
Just because of you she isn't mine even after becoming mine.
I want to kill you... but how can I remove you from her heart?
First you remove this doubt from your heart, Mr. Oberoi.
Get lost...
Just go away...
before I...
Just get lost!
Why did you do this?
Why?
It was not in my control.
It Just happened.
And continued to happen.
Why me... why with me, God?
I'll bring the taxi.
Jia...
Jia... are you alright, Jia?
Just hold on.
Jia.
Just give me a hand.
Leave me.
Jia, Just give me hand.
- Leave me I say.
The petrol is coming out.
It may catch fire at any moment.
Don't be stupid.
I said get out.
Leave me.
Fine, Jia.
What if you want to be here?
Fine...
I am also going to be here...
this damn car may go on fire...
Fine!
Why did you come here, Aditya?
Why did you come here?
Trust me.
- Just go away.
- Come on.
Let me get you out from here.
- Just go away.
Should I say something?
You don't know how to do it.
What will I do by staying alive?
You need to be alive if I have to be alive.
It's Aditya...
Adi, go from here... go...
Adi...
Leave me...
Its okay.
Just calm down.
Calm down.
YourJia.
Once an Indian woman is married to someone she dedicates her life to him.
She can never break that relationship and that's a fact.
Aditya...
Jia may not break this relationship but Karan Oberoi can.
Today I understood one thing.
Relation must be the bonding of hearts.
If there isn't any bonding then relation suffocates the person.
There will be no place for love there.
Anyway I don't like anything piecemeal.
I want everything completely my own.
Come, Jia.
You are free from every relation today.
Come, you are free.
Come with me please, Jia... come.
Karan, what did you do?
I broke a relation so that a bond becomes stronger.
But how can you...
How long, uncle?
How long should we sacrifice lives in the name of tradition?
Relationships are needed for life but life shouldn't depend on them.
My choice was correct.
But they are made for each other.
No, Mr. Oberoi!
They are meant for each other.
- Guys, come here and talk.
- What's up?
Inspector has something to say.
All get there!
Yes!
- What?
What do you want?
- Guys, ID card.
ID card?
What's that stuff?
I don't know.
- Are you playing tricks?
- So what?
Stand at the wall!
Body search!
No!
You like to search me?
I'm gonna strip naked.
Come search me!
Dare you?
You tortoises, don't even think you can get help.
You'll never be faster than me.
Listen, here after midnight...
I'll take full control!
Taking full control after midnight... is what most triads think nowadays.
Once Hong Kong returned, they took the police as nothing.
So they took the chance to expand their territory.
They openly recruit guys... to sell soft drug and porn discs... and bully teachers and students in schools.
They show off their power in front of cops.
They scare and insult cops.
These are acts of leaving the cops alone.
It is absolutely unbearable!
I think the most useful way is to send more insider.
The number of active bosses is about 200.
An insider may not even reach any of them.
The success rate is less than 1/3
Then send 300 to 500 guys there.
Should we send 500 insiders then?
Why not?
If that's not enough, then 1000.
They'll sneak into the triads' core like phantoms, gain their absolute trust and keep getting their info.
Now the groups are still running wild.
I'll make them disbelieve anyone... and be able to do nothing.
Inspector Wai, you have 7 years of experience.
I hope you'll be in charge of it.
Choose guys from all police departments now.
Speed up the tests and give Department of Justice the list.
But they must be ensured that the police will not press charges against them for their involvement in criminal activities.
Or else who dares to do so?
Tony Leung
Superintendent Kong, the key mission must be codenamed now.
We use so many insiders to beat the bandits...
Let's call it "Crouching Tiger".
Their relationships in NT and Kowloon're complicated.
In Tuen Mun they're all "Sun Kee's".
In Tsuen Wan. they're completely with "Wo's".
Every group wanna control Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui.
Sun Kee's should have the most people.
Before Hong Kong's return, many bosses quitted.
Therefore some groups are extending.
Their powers are evenly distributed.
Some small districts are even more fierce.
You mean "Humanity"?
That's why when we started the action 2 years ago, the number of insiders we sent in "Humanity"... is no less than in other groups.
I wanna finish it first.
How, Inspector Wai?
Their leader is known as "the Boss".
That's a sly guy.
Always pretends to be sick.
All problems are given to Sophie to explain.
When there're conflicts, he refuses all responsibilities.
He has a few followers.
Jim, working on illegal betting.
He's a capable guy.
Brains of the group.
Loyal to his boss.
Walter, a loan shark.
A hot-tempered guy.
Why is there a star in his file?
One more, Fei.
The group's magazine, has most members.
Everyone call for his help before action.
But this guy's very wily.
Good at gaining profits.
So what about the lawyer, Martin?
He's the group's lawyer.
Expert in strategies.
And so these guys know much about law.
And, Tommy's the most arrogant these few years.
He has risen sharply during 1 or 2 years.
He opened up a sauna room with everything inside.
He even sells soft drug to massage girls.
Deducted from their month's wage.
- Don't trouble me.
- Got it.
Boss relies on him to do the money laundry these 2 years.
So he's the best in Boss's mind.
Give me these when I'm back.
So who should we work on first?
The 1st one must be Tommy.
Beat him, then "Humanity" will break up right away.
He has an intimate guy called Chuen... who sells pills in the district.
Our insider, Eric, has become sworn brothers.
Once Chuen admits Tommy's deeds, the group will break down completely.
Count it, nothing wrong.
Hawk 1, calling 2, 3, 4, 5.
Chicken confirmed...
CID!
You're now under arrest!
Action!
CID!
Don't move!
- Freeze!
- Don't move!
Don't move!
Chuen, you're now under arrest!
Jim.
Gosh, penalty kick.
Useless.
Game over.
This is not the 1st time you work for me.
Why draw back?
No.
What do you mean?
I've been sick for 2 days.
Seein the doctor?
Sure.
Enterogastritis.
What's really happening?
I've been getting along with Eric.
I can't do that.
Anyone tells you he's an insider?
Not sure yet.
You're a cop?
Need evidence?
Take a sick leave if you don't wanna work?
We must eliminate him.
Or he'll bite us back and we all die.
Are you sure?
The keeper's unsure if the ball will get in.
But he attacked his enemy and got a penalty kick.
What do you think?
Penalty kick can be blocked probably.
If he can't block it, then the whole team suffers.
If Boss says I'm an insider and gets guys to kill me...
- Will the guys ask Boss?
- Surely not.
Why?
It's a matter of the entire group.
Go get him now.
Leave no trace.
Get me his phone.
Died on Duty.
Have his parents come... outside.
Mrs. Chan...
I'm Wai.
This is Chief Inspector Ming.
We were instructors when Chan was in training center.
What instructors are you?
Other guys became good men when they left.
But my son had became worse than ever.
He entered the triad, and now...
Who will I live with?
I have only one son.
Now he's gone...
How should I ever live?
Tell me... tell me!
Excuse me, sir...
Mrs. Chan.
Take a seat.
We've applied for pensions for you.
Your living will not be a problem.
Does Eric remain anything here?
Where's his phone?
Wait.
Something happens.
Who?
Is Eric here?
Who are you?
He's not here?
Sure.
He's gone to the washroom.
Leave your number.
I'll tell him to call you.
What's the odds of Manchester United?
- 0.5/-1, but it fluctuates fast.
Better leave your number.
I'll call you then.
Tell him Wai's calling him.
He knows me.
Who are you?
So you're Superintendent Wai.
I'm his partner.
Whether we get rich or you lose everything... let's look at this match.
Superintendent Wai.
Honestly, you cops shouldn't bet so much on it.
You'll be embarrassed if you lose again.
We'll never lose this time.
The ball is round.
Anything could happen.
Matches start every day.
I am never scared.
Sure.
If Superintendent Wai wanna bet, go look for Eric and talk with him.
See you.
Let's go.
Yes.
Write down the names then throw it into the sea.
See how many bastards act like Eric.
Got it.
We gotta do it fast.
Don't know if Eric's phone... has our colleagues' numbers.
Yes, sir.
Have you contacted our guys outside?
Still calling.
Replied
Superintendent Wai, others are OK apart from Eric.
Jim, your bird nest soup for Boss is pretty good.
It's fattening.
Sophie!
Boss!
Sorry everyone.
I'm late.
I'm tired.
You keep it on.
I'm taking a rest.
I'll stay with you.
Bro.
We're waiting for you.
Why so late?
Jim, you killed Eric.
How do I clear up the mess?
You can never do nothing.
Chuen's inside.
If Eric doesn't die, Chuen and we are gonna die.
God... it's lucky this time.
Just that Eric forgets to delete the message... and is seen by his guys...
Say nothing about that.
The most important is when Chuen comes out.
tell him not to be too exaggerated.
Will Chuen be able to come out?
Martin, do you think Chuen can come out?
Once Eric couldn't show up as a witness, then the case is over.
All prosecutions will be cancelled.
Some guys say there're 1000 insiders... and now we only get one.
There're still 999 to catch, right?
No wonder the "Black Feet" (cops) have vanished?
Cops have become yakuzas.
I don't believe there're so many insiders.
Bye.
Don't go.
What about the meeting?
What meeting?
Jim has many things to say.
He's the boss.
Whatever he says!
What?
He's absent again?
Alright.
Go check it.
See how many of those insiders we have.
Gotta kill them all.
It's too much trouble.
I think you'd better not think too much.
We're humans.
Go treat your guys better.
Then the insiders will really become our guys.
Just like that cunning Tommy...
Bandits will become insider.
Do you think so?
I have nothing to say.
I'll stand by.
Call me anytime you want.
How about calling Chuen now?
Chuen may still not know that no witness means no case.
I've told Superintendent Mok that before he meets a lawyer, try forcing him to say something more.
OK.
Superintendent Wai, you also like this game?
This is for alerting myself.
A-E-I-O-U
There must be one vowel.
Hit?
No.
Excuse me.
We've come to find Chuen.
Please take a seat right there and wait a moment.
Thank you.
Chuen, come out!
Sir, what're you doing?
Did the person involved crawl or walk here?
We wanna see your superior.
No problem.
Now Eric's giving statement next door.
Did your lawyer tell you how many years you'll be in jail?
Superintendent Mok, before the lawyer's come...
I have the rights to say nothing, right?
I gotta tell you, 3 years at least.
Plus any kind of inflicting injury or manslaughter... 7 years.
Inflicting injury?
What're you talking about?
When did I commit manslaughter?
There're 2 inflicting injuries and 1 manslaughter... in July, August and September 2005.
You're the suspected doer.
Any more crimes will make you suffer.
What you said has nothing to do with me.
So who's involved!
Say it!
Why're you still here?
Get me your superior.
I'm responsible for watching you here.
How can I meet your superior, sir?
You really want me to say?
This is your last chance.
Will you not tell others that I say it?
I promise.
Fine.
Then I'm telling you the truth.
That several cases... were all done by Andy Lau, the super star.
Every night I have the same dream...
Superintendent Mok, I'll talk to you... next week.
You're great, Fei.
Chuen gets them all done.
Now you've done a great job.
- Martin, are you OK?
- Why do you say so?
I should work for the group. shouldn't I?
Fei called me to tell you.
If Eric dies, there'll be no witness to sue you.
What about the guy who just got there?
How long?
Mere trifle.
Half a year.
Is our action problematic?
We still have no real action so far... and a main is gone.
No problem.
We've made the plain earlier.
I'm head of CIB.
I'm responsible for their safety.
You used to be an insider.
You should know... how much they gotta suffer.
I know.
I did face it.
All we could do is wait for attack.
We hope to get more info so that they'll collapse.
But now one of us has sacrificed his life.
Then we gotta attack.
I need to polarize them and let them fear.
- Boss.
- Boss.
- Jim...
- Congratulations...
- You're so late!
- Congratulations...
Call him Fei.
Fei!
No regret?
Regret for what?
Just regret why we worked together years ago.
Can't keep the account well.
Lose money every day.
Just when I quit, he gets rich.
The feng shu tree right there agitates me.
I told him to put it there but he said it looked badly.
And now it's been right there.
And I also counted that... 5 or 6 members are his relatives.
Any guy know what's happening.
Say it!
Boss, the wage is too low.
I can't bear it.
You guys were clear when you started to work.
Take the stock and I'll deduct from your wage.
We used to buy it from other places and...
Why don't you say it when you feel good?
My stocks are the best.
Work hard if the wage is not enough.
Also, don't let me know you buy it anywhere else.
I'll still deduct them from the wage.
Get out!
Don't work like dead men!
This kind of attitude... sucks.
I'm the father of Dee, class 4B.
Miss Fong called me to come.
OK, I'm informing her now.
Please wait a moment.
Thank you very much.
Superintendent Wai.
Thank you.
The world has been changing.
Years ago, mothers come.
Now fathers come.
What the heck.
Are mothers... even busier than fathers?
Sure.
When my class teacher sought my parents... and came home, mom beat me hard.
Superintendent. you should be busy.
Can't compare with you.
What do we do if you're not busy?
Sir, almost every inch of Hong Kong will be yours.
What will we live on?
Sure.
It's time to learn how to bring up a kid.
What's wrong with your son?
Stay after school again?
Did your son... fight with others?
What a match.
Fight too?
With your son?
Sir, please mind your words.
It's not that he fights with my son.
Your son beat mine.
Then I'm so sorry for that.
Why sorry?
A kid's fist can't kill.
I always tell my son... not to make any troubles in school.
Don't fight with others.
The one who fights first is wrong.
Isn't it?
But my son is a strange kid.
He likes music.
So I get a guy to teach him violin.
He's gifted and plays well.
Now he's in grade 8.
Later he'd try something like diploma.
You have a very good son...
Kids are never like years ago.
They used to calm down after dads beat them.
Now you beat him and he sues you.
We have to be... friends.
Gotta have communications.
What's up... miss?
Hello, Mr. Wai.
- I've talked with Felix that...
- Miss.
Mr. Wai is this handsome guy.
Sorry, Mr. Wai.
Since you're with disciplined service,
I hope you'd talk with Felix at home.
It's good to maintain good discipline.
But it's problematic to do it with force.
I'm sorry.
Remember what you promised to say?
Sure I do.
I'm busy.
See you.
What do you want to say?
I know I'm wrong.
I blamed Ronald for cutting in a queue without making sure.
I shouldn't have beaten him even if he did it.
So did you say sorry to him?
Sorry.
Doesn't matter.
Long as it's all clear.
Sure.
Shake ass and be good friends.
Dad.
What?
I won't really do that for sure.
Let's shake hands and be good friends, OK?
Walter.
What's up?
That bastard Big Mouth doesn't wanna pay the debt.
If this time...
Sir.
Go on.
Nothing.
That bastard Big Mouth's fooling us.
Can't get the money back if we don't chop him.
He even said that you're... his sworn brother.
Fall out just because of money.
He adds some words...
What did he say?
Hopes your whole family dies.
Call Fei for back up right now.
Find Big Mouth's... principal.
I want to... "kiss" him.
If he doesn't pay, "kiss" his hand and leg.
Do you know?
Bro, I don't think fast.
How about saying once again...
Dad said he want to use Fei's manpower... to find that bastard Big Mouth.
and beat him up.
And...
If he still doesn't pay, chop his hand and leg off.
Understand?
Son of a bitch!
A hand and a leg?
Just find him.
Why keep asking?
- Fei.
I've thought about it...
- Fei.
Yes.
If you need 50 guys, the process is like this...
What's that?
Fat Cow delivers something tonight.
So there're only 2 guys.
Bald Head... has 3.
Acne said he's sick and can't come.
But he can get you 7 guys.
Threebie has no guys but...
Don't trouble me.
Just tell me how many guys... will come tonight!
OK, no problem.
The workflow is like this.
Fat Cow'll deliver something.
He only gets 2 guys.
Bald...
Bean!
Tell me honestly.
You've been staying with me for years... do you really understand me?
The total number is... 37.
Fei, I can help you if you need guys.
I love to chop people.
You think 37 is not enough?
- You like chopping guys?
- Sure.
Chop your mama.
Go chop your mama!
Walter needs 50 guys.
Give him a discount... 30 something.
That's enough, right?
Fei!
I said I'm here, darling.
When did I ever leave?
Big Mouth, what's up?
Really?
Then Walter is really wrong.
How many?
I can give 1000.
80?
OK.
I'll Call you when I'm done.
Fei!
Coming...
Get it done yourself.
What's up, darling?
Why change the ring tone?
That is...
Shall we travel to Japan or Europe?
- You decide it.
- No.
You decide it!
I'm busy at work.
You...
Better go to Japan.
Gals in Europe have big breasts.
Too good for you.
You decide it.
Laugh what?
Did you play with all gals with huge breasts?
I ever played yours only...
I'll join it now.
- I said I'm busy...
- No!
- Will you go then?
- Go...
Honey, pick up the phone.
Hello...
Honey...
Who was calling?
- Fei.
- Yes.
50 guys are here.
They're ready.
Say it and they'll take action.
Call him...
Walter.
Walter...
Louder!
Walter!
Everybody listen.
Today we're here not to celebrate.
Understand?
You come out.
Come out.
What's up, Walter?
Why are you laughing?
Keep laughing for one minute!
Fuck you!
Why do you laugh?
Do you understand?
Yes!
Do you know what you'll do?
Yes!
What's the background?
Yes!
Think about it right there!
- OK.
- Got it!
Find Big Mouth.
See if he'll come.
Walter!
Big Mouth!
I just thought you were lost.
You have too much debt so you dare not come out?
You're right.
My debt is not small at all.
Lucky that my guys like me and don't force me to return.
I owe you several ten thousand and you keep troubling me.
Do I need to talk if I do wanna finish you?
Money...
I'm not able to pay.
What do you wanna talk?
Then we don't need to talk.
You'll never leave.
You fucking asshole!
You got money to get help but you didn't give me back?
Call him out!
I spent none calling for help!
You, why do you laugh again?
I've told you not to laugh.
Why?
Damn!
You're standing at the wrong place!
What?
Sure.
You know you're standing at the wrong place?
Fei!
Here.
What the hell...
Get 2 gals here?
And these 3...
What are these old men doing here?
I don't mean it.
He looks more or less the same as you.
You guys are all the same.
Nearly 90 and you're still wearing pet chains?
And this guy.
Look.
Why laugh?
How dare you!
Still standing at the wrong place!
I think it's not good to walk here and there...
What?
You think it's a joke?
You're here to help!
I don't mean to play tricks.
Why send me such old stuff?
Explain it.
Fei!
I am not happy now.
I said I need guys like those in F4.
Who do you give me?
Bullshit!
Bosses, stay calm.
You're big bro, right?
And you, right?
Me too!
Find me if you want guys.
I bring some guys here... just to fulfill your wishes.
Thank you.
Don't need to talk about our wishes.
You think we won't pay for it?
Money...
I'm not hurried for it...
Why didn't you tell me about the party?
And you.
Get the old stuff here...
- ...at midnight for what?
- Send them away.
- The meals' money...
- Get lost.
You still want money?
You said you wanna fulfill my wish and I need to pay?
Go.
Get out!
You guys.
You know the cops're watching us.
Why make troubles?
I'm not scared.
But I am.
Your stuff and his stuff are all the same as mine.
It's all about our group!
I know.
But what about the debt Big Mouth owes me?
We can negotiate with him later.
Come on, listen.
That fighting game's over.
You may retreat.
Got it.
Retreat.
Go!
Yes, sir!
Monkey.
Wait, I'm buying a magazine.
Excuse me, give me a magazine.
I scared you, now it's my treat.
Thanks.
You get used to... scaring people with a knife at midnight?
Of course not.
You dare walk out at midnight.
How can I scare you?
What a gutsy guy.
A woman working at night here.
I design display windows.
I work after they're off duty.
What's your job?
Watch dogs.
Watch dogs?
Watch paparazzi.
I'm editor of a magazine.
So you know a lot of secrets?
No.
They're all fake...
Fake?
You're editor.
So you're experienced in graphics?
What do you think?
Quite special.
Really?
Especially empty.
There's Nothing inside.
Sure, I haven't put anything inside yet.
It's OK.
Honestly, I do notice these things, because...
I like them.
Once when I was in Europe...
I saw lamp stands all being tied.
Not that with braids.
It's that they're bent and tie themselves.
Good idea!
Try it if there's chance.
Time to pack up?
Not yet.
I need to take a rest.
Why don't you have a drink outside?
I must rest more later... call me.
I can stay with you later.
Good.
I forgot your number.
Tell me once more.
Your name is Elaine...
How do you know my name?
Sure, I said I had your number before.
Tell me.
9855... 1122
Fine.
It's sent to you.
You sent it to me?
What I've just given you... is my mom's number.
The one I sent to you is my dad's.
I'm going.
Call me if you're free.
- Thanks.
See you.
- See you.
A massage gal in Tommy's sauna room told me something.
What's happening?
She said Tommy's drugs are more expensive than others.
She was not satisfied so she told me.
That's good.
Once they're in trouble, we can act right away.
Got it.
Should have an "E".
Bingo!
This is free.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Hurry...
Sir, any drugs?
I can't tell.
Hurry up.
Check the license number KF378.
The cops're looking for me?
Sure.
So there's a cop with you.
Eric, that son of a bitch?
All guys in the shop get drugs from you.
You're in trouble if anyone tells the cops.
In the past, even if the cops found drugs... and offensive weapons, we could get a scapegoat.
You'll be convicted of using bribes and illegal workers... running vice premises and tax exemption only.
But they want you die.
It doesn't matter.
Martin will fix it.
Difficult.
You have a criminal record.
The judge'll trust them... and won't let you out.
What did Boss say?
Boss told you to stay away for a while.
There's no choice then.
How about my business?
If you trust me.
I'll watch it for you.
Of course I trust you.
But also, take care of my mom.
She likes paper cup cake.
Don't let her eat too fast.
Don't worry.
I'll treat her as my mom.
I'll get Fei to help you.
Thank you.
Mom, I gotta go for a while.
Call the nurse if you need help.
She must help you.
I'm leaving.
Done.
That's all.
Done.
Watch out if they're in danger.
But if they're not, I'll be in danger.
Fei!
We're in trouble!
The cops're coming.
Some pirated and porn disc stalls... and 3 plants were wiped out.
Bald Head and Threebie were caught.
Twobie is in a mess.
Why did it happen so suddenly?
Where's Ball?
He hasn't shown up for 2 days.
He wanted to have day-off and I refused.
Then he never appeared.
Turn it off if you're playing game.
Just common sense.
Chief Inspector Ming, something's happened.
News from paparazzi who's tracking Fei.
Little Fai.
I have here Fei's old buddy who wants to see Fei so much.
Anything to do?
He sent us a thorough pocket PC.
They said he never left during those days.
He doesn't know we wiped them out.
Tell the paparazzi to follow him up.
Beware that Fei takes him as an insider.
Fei, you're here?
Sure.
And you.
I looked for you for 2 days.
I Miss you so much.
I couldn't find you.
I'll visit you in 503, Tai Yuen Estate, right?
You're wrong, Fei.
It's 305.
- Really?
- Sure.
So it's 305.
Should've told me earlier.
Sorry.
I've been playing games in an internet cafe.
That new game's fun, I was...
You had fun... but I didn't.
What's up, Fei?
My stalls were all wiped out.
Do you know how much I've lost?
I don't know, but I must help you.
You know I love chopping guys.
Chop you bastard!
The cops send one here, and I'll give them back.
If they send 1000 guys here...
I'll give 1000 fools back to them.
Keep clear.
Keep clear!
Crash... crash into it!
You son of a bitch!
Don't know how to crash?
You've finally gone there.
You called the taxi driver?
Stop it.
What the heck're you doing?
Bullshit!
What're you doing?
Get away.
- Who do you think I am?
- Get away.
Go to work!
Hurry!
Have you got it...
I'm driving a target in Tai Po.
Now we're going to the hospital.
Roger.
Things get much easier with this guy.
Ask him when he wakes up.
Has your stuff not come yet?
Coming.
Here comes the noodles.
Great!
What're you eating?
What's this?
Beef stomach noodles.
You can eat this kind of things?
Why not?
I gotta tell you a story.
Once Boss sent us to Indonesia to work for him.
We said when things got wrapped up, we'd each take... a souvenir from him.
Little Tommy was excited... and chopped the guy of his right hand.
I couldn't lose.
Then I took a knife and slashed his stomach open.
I pulled anything I touched.
The guy yelled...
I pulled again and he yelled...
I took the stuff out.
It was still warm and bloody.
I grabbed it tight and broke it!
Damn.
That was his stomach.
Do you know?
That guy just ate a meal.
The food had been stinking...
It's nothing.
One more story.
Bastard Jim saw us taking things so he did it also.
What did he take?
Stupid ass.
He took his shoes back!
He said it was because... the heel was high and he'd look taller.
Walter, Jim's calling you.
Higher!
Sure, what's up?
What?
OK.
OK...
What I'm worried most is that... we'd be in trouble if there're insiders who tell the cops.
Boss said, better stay calm.
Alright.
Let's have some rest for a while.
They have no evidence.
They can do nothing.
Now the one who's in trouble... is you.
You have Tommy's stocks.
They can freeze your account at any time.
I've quitted.
All documents could prove you're a shareholder.
Take away these things.
He returned the money to me, which means I quit.
After Tommy ran...
I'd read all his accountant's documents.
Soon I found that he didn't go through procedures.
So what?
I don't see any cops troubling me.
It's a matter of time.
When stalls have problems, the head will suffer.
Once they prove you're the head, they'll freeze your account.
including your wife's... your parents' and relatives'...
All related to you will get their accounts frozen.
Will they go this fair?
It's what cops do.
Doesn't mean that we're the same, though.
This problem... we should ask Boss.
He's not in a good mood.
Let's not tell him so far.
I think you don't need to worry so much.
Work together and the cop can do nothing.
What they have done today... is to let us be in a mess.
I think we should act earlier than they do.
Find out the insiders as fast as we can.
Kill one every day.
Kill a dozen in 10 days.
See who's the first to draw back.
How about me?
My account'll be frozen.
And my wife's account...
Ours are still fine.
You can use ours.
Do you understand?
Your money is yours.
My money is mine.
I have money.
Why use yours?
The doer must suffer.
Walter.
What're you doing?
Newbie?
I didn't see you before.
He's been here for 5 years.
A nervous guy...
Jim, watch him.
Operation denied.
Please contact our branch.
Walter...
What's up?
Calm down...
Get me some hard stuff.
Break them...
Stop it!
Calm down...
CCTV here, bro.
What?
Government is nothing!
Dare freeze my account?
Alright.
Take out all your cards.
He...
I saw him once...
Come on... everyone takes out $10.000.
I haven't.
Take out $10.000!
Quick!
Walter, what would you like?
- The same.
- Fine.
Walter.
What a coincidence.
Your account's frozen and you're so relaxed.
That doesn't matter.
It's good as long as your account's not frozen.
Last time Jim got it done.
Then... 3 installments, $100.000 each.
You didn't seem to pay it last time.
No.
I'm talking with you.
Calm down.
You know there're insiders everywhere.
The cops get it if anything happens.
Walter, you wanna make troubles again?
Big Mouth, you... lend me some if you can.
What do you mean?
Several hundred?
Who do you think I am?
You don't want it?
It's torn off, bro.
Pay the bill!
Kin... bastard Kin...
It's going to rain.
I have to rush home...
You like to scare people?
Just got off?
Find me?
I just wanna chat with you.
I called you but your phone's turned off.
I changed my number...
and I'm afraid you missed me... so I come to tell you my new number.
But I'm not free now.
I'm buying flowers.
- Good.
- What 'good'?
I'm free.
I'll go with you.
Where to?
Places that sell flowers, of course.
Let's go.
OK.
I'm driving.
I'm not gonna go.
I'm not married yet.
I don't wanna risk my life.
What?
Just kidding.
Actually I like adventures.
I always dream of being an Italian godfather... having gunfights with cops...
Leave me alone.
May godfather be with you!
What the hell?
Sorry, mister.
I'll just stay for a while and then leave.
Give way.
Take it.
Come on.
Let's park the car here.
Come.
Park the car.
Are you encouraging crimes?
What's better than having a good space?
You can't do that!
Go buy the flowers.
Hurry up...
Purple roses!
You have good taste!
Purple roses are only sold here on this street.
How much each?
So expensive!
It's new, shipped by air.
So do you have 200 flowers?
Sure.
You really want them?
Let me think.
Sure.
Do you think they can give a discount?
Sure they will.
You go ask them.
No way.
Women are good at it.
Guys don't know how.
I don't know how.
Please.
Excuse me.
Yes!
What's up?
We wanna buy a lot.
Can you sell at a lower price?
It's very low already.
It's nothing if you wanna give them to gals.
You made it wrong.
We use them for a movie.
The budget is very tight.
How much do you want?
$5 each.
$5?
Of course not!
$12.
Fixed price.
Buy, or leave.
$12, 200 flowers.
OK.
I'll pack them up.
Thank you.
We've saved $200.
If you said nothing.
I would've bought for $10 each.
It's the first time I negotiated a price.
It's the first time I see negotiation' like this.
Let it be.
What kind of person are you?
What do mean by that?
Your mental age is far different from your actual one.
You mean I'm stupid?
I think a person doesn't need to be so complicated.
I love my job.
Dad and mom love me.
I'm so happy.
Alright.
Do you have boyfriend?
No.
My dad said my working hours are strange.
He fears I'd get along with bad people, like triads.
There're good guys in those groups.
I don't think so.
So do you think there's no bad cop?
Maybe there're some.
That's it.
Think about it.
Are good eggs in a pack... all good eggs?
Not for sure.
Are there some good eggs among bad ones?
No.
So you think all guys in the triads are bad?
It's only a smile.
Get in the car.
Miss!
How do you drive?
You changed to rear gear and crash into my car!
I haven't even started the engine.
How?
You crashed into him.
I saw it.
It's your fault...
This guy can be the witness.
It wouldn't be this serious even if I did it.
Yours is an European car and mine is from Japan.
It's much more vulnerable!
Shut up.
Pay for it now.
Pay for it?
Why should I?
I'll call the cops if you don't.
And this person can be the witness.
Call the cops!
Wait!
Don't scare women.
I'll pay for you.
Now you are making sense.
I don't wanna cause you unhappiness.
You should've prepared for it.
How much do you want?
$15.000 at least.
- $15.000?
- No.
Don't quarrel with him.
He looks familiar.
Give a discount then.
It's deep in the night, I don't have that much.
I just have $3.000.
$3.000?
You son of a... $3.000 is better than nothing.
See how this man treats you so well.
Now I'll take the money.
You'll never earn so much tonight.
What're you talking about?
Get in the car.
Let's go...
Goodbye, my boss.
Enjoy yourself.
It's yours...
They just blackmailed us.
Why must you give him money?
I'm gonna tell you a secret.
Honestly, I'm Superman's good friend.
I'll call him to revenge us right away.
And Spiderman will come too.
What kind of person are you?
Your mental age is far different from your actual one.
You mean I'm stupid?
Sure.
OK.
We are two of a kind...
Let's go!
Now you have to suffer!
You gotta pay a lot for it.
Sorry... bro, what's up?
Police!
You're Yau Chi Bill, right?
Now come with us.
Why should I come with you?
Just come!
Honey, run!
Help...
Let her go!
Shit.
Why get back?
Don't worry.
It's OK.
Freeze.
OK.
I'll come with you.
You don't catch me because I'm handsome, aren't I?
Or you wanna know more about my district's culture?
What?
Hammer and phone book?
And I need to strip naked?
Come beat me.
Are you all right?
We'll beat you for sure.
I don't mind if you complain.
Now one of our guys are dead.
Your guy's dead... is not my business!
You go out first.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Why don't we have a chat?
Who killed Eric?
You don't know, sir?
You know, right?
How do I know?
Go ask Jim.
You helped him to run?
No, sir.
I didn't receive any orders.
Go ask Jim if you want to know.
Everything has to do with him.
About what did they talk with you?
Cops... couldn't even get a single word.
This is our Fei.
OK, that's it.
But he mentioned a guy.
Killer.
Get up now?
I just had a breakfast at 8.
I feel a bit hungry.
What to do?
Something wrong with you?
I'm OK.
You go.
Maybe you're pregnant.
See a doctor now.
Bastard!
I don't wanna cheat you.
I'm with the triad group.
We can still be friends, though.
- I'm going.
- Call me later.
Jim!
Come back with us now.
Sir, won't you sue me of patronizing prostitutes?
How long should we wait for your lawyer?
It doesn't matter.
Whether he comes or not, my answer is the same.
I'll say I don't know whatever you ask me.
I saw Fei a couple of days ago.
He told me so many things.
Now we suspect you of last week's... murder case in which the victim's called Eric.
We want you to assist in the investigation.
You wanna polarize us?
Sue me if you have evidence.
Superintendent Wai...
I wanna say a few words.
We're very much alike.
No matter if we're gangsters or a cops.
when we've done something wrong... nobody knows but it doesn't mean we've done nothing.
You're the same.
It seems...
You can detain me for 48 hours at most.
I've already had a shower before I came.
Jim.
Killer's inside.
Jim, why're you in such a hurry to find me?
You gotta leave.
When?
As fast as you can.
I'm gonna help you.
How can I help you?
You don't need to call me.
I must find you when you're still alive.
Thanks.
Tiny stuff.
No need to thank me.
You've done a lot of work.
I thank you not because of your money.
Am I like that kind of person?
I don't know why...
I'm always thinking about the lamp stands you mentioned.
Killer.
Do you think there's good guy in the triads?
You.
Thanks.
Alright.
I'll tell you when I get it done.
That thug has come, Jim must be threatened.
You're his good pal.
Go help him.
Sure I will.
Superintendent Wai.
You guys just wanna close the case of Eric.
I'll make you satisfied as far as I can.
What's up?
The killer was at risk.
Do you know that?
Sure.
I'm thinking about that.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know what you're talking about, Jim.
It's hard to run a gang.
If everyone only cares about himself... he must die.
Are you talking about me?
I'm not teaching you anything here.
I'm a human.
I fear of death too.
I don't wanna get caught.
I just know... the only way to survive is to unite.
Now we're well united.
That's good.
Get Tommy for me.
I have something to talk to him.
Hasn't Tommy gone?
The world is never fair.
I've been working for the group... helping the group to gain... and now I gotta suffer everything by myself.
And I have to leave.
Jim's great.
Full of crafty plots.
He told me to run and he took all my business, then cooperate with Walter.
Once he gets more powerful, you will be the next one.
If you're killed.
he'd surely win the next election.
But you're kind-hearted.
You can't think of Jim's actions.
Jim...
Go tell him...
I didn't tell Boss this time.
If Boss knows, he must suffer.
Jim, I want to...
Listen, I've done countless things... all for the sake of you guys and for the group.
Honestly, you don't need to go.
It's no difference whether you leave or not...
I won't go.
I have brains and you have arms.
Stay and compete with that pygmy.
Get off the car.
Come in.
Superintendent Wai, Tommy just gave a call.
He wanna talk with you.
Can't you find out where he's staying?
Yes, he always uses a new phone number.
Wai, Tommy, right?
I warn you.
You're now wanted by the police.
Please give up as soon as possible.
Now you cops can't find Killer, which is your mistake.
It's none of my business.
We don't need to explain everything to you.
You do wanna give up a key indemnified witness like me?
There're many important guys.
But the ideal one is not you for sure.
What?
Can't deal with the tortoises?
Seems Boss must do something.
Killer will do so even if Boss doesn't.
Killer thinks Jim betrays him.
You fear he'd do nothing?
Superintendent Wai, it seems he can't speak well.
He only gave me this paper slip.
Where's he?
This way, Superintendent Wai.
Superintendent Wai, don't embarrass such an old man.
Come have a chat.
What a small world.
We knew each other long ago.
Chiu did something wrong and ran to Indonesia.
Boss got us guys to finish him.
In the last blade... nobody dared to do it.
So they let me do it.
I was looking at Chiu... and suddenly wanted to let him go.
Then I took his shoe and told him...
I wasn't bold enough to take anything out of him.
He's still laughing at it.
Chiu was lucky and finally healed up.
He keeps saying that I saved his life.
Now we're friends.
We talk about everything.
He told me that... when you were an insider, he did something big with you.
Robbed the jewelry shop and killed 2 cops.
Fortunately, nobody knew it.
But it doesn't mean you haven't done it.
What surprises me is that you did kill cops... but you're still getting promoted so fast.
You caught many bosses and did great jobs.
The cops are still searching for that bandit, but... nobody ever knows it.
Chiu's getting old.
He feels guilty so he comes to surrender.
Life is simple.
You treat me well, I treat you well.
If you go easy on us, everything will be fine.
I think Chiu... will also agree with me.
Chiu, say goodbye to Superintendent Wai.
We're leaving.
Is Chief Superintendent Kong here?
When will he come back?
I'm Wai.
Please leave him a message.
It's urgent.
Thanks.
How is it?
Does bird's nest soup taste good?
Gotta thank Jim.
He brought it here.
OK.
I'll give you more if you like.
OK.
Thank you.
So much things happening these days.
Therefore, I'm holding a meeting here.
Specially invited Uncles Wai, Mau and Horn... to give some advice.
We don't need to hear what others do.
But things're getting worse... and we must review it.
No need to say anymore.
Tommy's such a bastard.
He cheated the boss... and he sells pills in his place and forces massage gals.
He's worst in making love without wearing a condom.
We'd better eliminate him.
He's our guy anyway.
Stop going too far.
Going too far?
I really wanna take him to fish and kill him with a rock.
How to do?
The government has accountability system.
We must have a guy to take the responsibility.
So please give me advice.
I suggest to vote secretly to cease any quarrels.
The one who has most votes should be irresponsible.
This is written by Uncle Wai.
He keeps the account.
I keep seeing his handwriting.
Fei's guy beat him up 2 years ago.
I never thought this uncle still hates it.
This is written by Uncle Mau.
He ran a restaurant and wrote the cuisines.
Did Walter do something bad to him?
They fought for the same gal.
Walter's words.
You even recognize it?
The 3 uncles and Fei don't know English.
Jim's English is good.
He doesn't only write capital letters.
So it must be written by Walter.
Damn you.
Stupid.
I can read it even if he wrote with his left hand.
Fei.
How do you know it's him?
Every guy had a bit of education.
How could he write the character "Boss" wrong?
It's Tommy.
Horn's a righteous guy.
He can't stay here.
This is blank.
It should be Jim.
He's great.
Acts like a boss.
He gives up.
Then just killing Tommy will do.
We can't.
Why?
I let them vote... not to know who they dislike most.
I wanna know who they like most.
I have to bear the greatest irresponsibility this time.
Just as the cops give more force, they'll rebel and put up somebody else.
Now I know who they like.
Jim?
Even some guys wanna kill me.
And no one thinks he's wrong.
That means he's the most respected.
The guys must support him.
From now on you have to...
buy the bird's nests yourself.
Damn.
I'm in trouble... and nobody can be found.
This is life.
They'll pay for it after all these things.
Have you ever thought to... change the environment?
Change the environment?
Change what?
Sure.
Unless...
- ...there's a quiet place to live.
- Will you go?
I do think about it.
I don't wanna lose everything.
So I wanna get what I lost as fast as I can.
My whole family'll move to a secret place.
I'll start over and be a good main.
Sure.
I've been asking something myself.
I wanna ask you now.
Do you think we are good guys?
Those outside the groups do think there's no good guy here.
Do you think so?
But what do I think about it?
I think we're better than many who say... they're good.
But have you realized that the inferiors are also changing.
They like to bully people.
They bully kids and old guys.
We were never the same.
Blame those in the groups.
They hire guys but don't teach them.
Now our groups is less reputed than ever.
Now you regret for it?
No.
A bit tired, though.
Go have a massage then.
I don't mean the porn one.
I mean find a person... who prepares for soup on your table... and says, "Darling, are you feeling tired?"
Have you ever been in love?
You must be in love with someone.
You psycho, I'm asking you.
You don't need to ask me.
Ask the balls.
Look...
Darker than your cloths.
They're becoming charcoals.
Aren't you bastard in love?
I don't know if I am.
Anyway... now it's feeling a bit... weird.
Bastard's in love!
Jim's in love...
Boss got Jim to have me killed.
Sophie told you to get Jim killed.
See who's the lucky one.
Really?
- What?
- Really?
You make yourself bleed from the nose.
Need to wash your face, sir?
Uncle!
I'm Dee.
Remember me?
Walter's son.
Walter's son.
It's Dee!
Haven't seen you for years.
Much taller now.
Come here and play with classmates?
Sure.
How about your dad?
How's he lately?
All the same.
Which room are you in?
Room 2.
Room 2... talk to you later.
Lost!
Take a pic...
Here.
Right here.
Looking for you.
Does your dad know you drink?
I didn't drink...
I went to classmate's birthday...
And you touch female pals and put off their underpants.
I really didn't do that.
I've just seen everything.
Don't tell my dad.
- Take it.
- What's this?
Good stuff.
To dissolve your alcoholic smell... then your dad won't know it.
Thanks.
Sent him to ICU.
- Dee!
- Dee...
Doctor, how's my son?
The patient took problematic pills...
probably drugs, which seriously harmed his brain cells.
He must sustain his life with equipments.
You have to prepare for it.
He may not wake up in a short period of time.
You bastards, come here!
- Piss off!
- Come out!
- Piss off!
- Come out!
It's not my business.
Shit!
Tell me... tell me what did you gave my son to eat!
- Say it...
- Take him out to feed the dogs!
It's really not mine.
I took a pic.
This... this guy...
He is the one...
Mom.
I've done the discharge for you.
I intend to...
let you live somewhere else.
Don't be scared.
We move by ship. not by air.
Mom, why're you so scared?
Don't do anything in front of my mom!
Monkey, stop.
Call HQ...
The target's in Flower Market.
Seems to be buying flower.
Don't need to track.
Back to HQ.
Are you all right?
Still working?
Yes, still working.
You're great.
You call me every time I wanna call you.
Do you always need me?
Don't kid me.
- I want you to buy flowers for me.
- Go back.
Flowers?
What flowers do you want?
Red roses.
Gosh, I can't help you now.
I'm going to Macau.
What're you going there for?
For fun, of course.
You're happy, aren't you?
Sure.
I don't know why.
I wanna play happier...
He's buying flowers for his gal.
He's going to your side.
Watch out.
When will you come back?
I don't know.
Maybe a few years...
Maybe a few minutes.
See if somebody's misses me.
How about your flowers?
Need to get some guys to buy and deliver to you?
Happy with that?
Is my feeling so important to you?
Quite a bit.
That's fine.
How are you?
I fear you'd miss me.
And you miss me so soon, too?
I wanna let you know that I never went to Europe.
And I never saw the bent light stands.
I knew it long ago.
You're not frank to me.
What I wanna be frank to you is that... you make me feel I'm in love.
I also knew it long ago.
If you appear right in front of me now.
maybe I'll accept it.
Now you say "I love Jim" 3 times... then I'll show up.
If Boss says I'm an insider and gets Monkey to kill me... will Money question about Boss?
Surely not.
Why?
It's the matter of the entire group.
Don't do it here...
I never begged anyone before...
Please...
Your flowers are here.
But I do wanna see you most.
Guys like you must be punished some day.
But never thought that God punishes his son.
Chief Superintendent Kong and I are waiting for you to come back.
For what?
I'm with the triads for decades... and I forgot how to be a cop.
You have always been a cop.
We only have different missions.
Once the cops perform the action tomorrow, you can come back to us.
Why hasn't Walter come back?
His mission is not yet over.
He's willing to be an insider for longer.
90584, we'll bring... your wife and son to Australia in advance.
When you finish the last mission... you'll meet them.
OK?
Yes, sir.
This is the new warrant.
We can take action.
But everybody listen.
Be very careful.
We may encounter resistance.
Understand?
Yes, sir!
Honey... 48 hours at most.
Sir, this is the warrant.
You're now under arrest.
You're suspected of engaging in activities of triad gangs.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
Yes, Chief Superintendent Kong.
Yes, I'm looking for you.
Some private matters.
It's about the murder of a cop a few years ago.
Can I come and talk with you now?
Sure.
Has mom come home yet?
Is your homework finished?
Are you still fighting with schoolmates?
Tell me if you did.
Be frank if you did something wrong, understand?
Do tell mom that dad'll be back a bit later.
Good boy.
See you.
Congratulations.
Congratulations?
On what?
Manslaughter.
You'll come out 5 years later.
The world 5 years later must have all things changed.
Walter, it's fast enough.
I was sentenced for 20 years.
I must die here.
You're still young.
You must be able to come out.
Bosses out there... are running and hiding everywhere.
Guys staying fewer than 5 years can't come close to them.
When you come out, with your influence and the years you stay with me, the seniors must value you.
You must be the leader 5 years later.
Talk about it 5 years later.
The world must be changed a lot.
37591, someone's calling on you.
Follow me.
I've already designated you.
Sir, what do you find me for?
Superintendent Wai handed me your file.
What about him?
He confessed murdering his own colleague.
He's now suspended from duties.
We'll do what he promised you.
Your wife and son are living in Australia.
And you're now sentenced for 5 years.
We really thank you.
Willing to be an insider staying with Boss.
And stay in Jail with Boss.
You've done a good job all these years.
How about my son?
He can walk himself and speak simple words.
Fine.
I just wanna tell you... 5 years later, when I come out...
I must live with my family in Australia.
Simple.
Sorry.
You can't.
Why?
We know that after you come out...
You must be the leader of the group.
Nobody'll compete with you.
We hope that after you become the leader... you keep being an insider.
You... are you silly?
The action will never be over.
We'll keep sending insiders there.
I'll quit.
Then your family'll be expelled by Australian government.
What?
We do really want you to be our insider.
I've gone to the place you told me.
Really beautiful.
Previously on "Alias":
I'm offering you the chance to destroy Sydney Bristow.
The moment this assignment is over, we'll give you back your daughter.
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.
You locked her in a train car, and you sprayed her with a chemical agent.
It's all there.
Everything you need to bring Nadia back.
I loaded the Bristow DNA template into the sequencer.
The genetic fluid is primed and ready.
That's not good enough.
Am I a dog whistle?
I said no.
N-o.
That's right.
That's better.
Thank you.
- You Mr. Halbe?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- I hope your trip wasn't too arduous.
- My trip was fine.
It's these marketing people.
BAs, MBAs.
Not a lick of common sense among 'em.
They almost didn't launch my new perfume, L'Eau de Passion.
- They thought the name was tacky.
- It's... a lovely name.
I know.
That's why I always trust my instincts.
And now it's flying off the shelves.
I assure you, we can take care of all your customer-service needs.
I don't want people suffering ten minutes of panflute waiting to order.
Of course not.
Let me show you our main call center.
Wow!
I think I came to the right place.
We got a lead on Anna.
She's routing her calls to a call center in Jaipur using an encrypted router.
She must have spliced one of these onto an outside line.
They have no idea she's piggybacking onto their system.
She's anonymous.
We locate the router, remove the encryption key.
Next time Anna makes a call, we listen in.
- Maybe trace her location.
- What's the approach?
All you need to do is get this perfume bottle within five feet of... a Wi-Fi access point, and then you can just map the phone system.
- We can figure out which line she's using.
- L'Eau de Passion?
- What, you think it's... too tacky?
- I'll work with it.
Soon we'll double our call-volume capacity.
You'll need to triple it when you start getting calls about this.
Stripe is on back order but the heather sprig is available.
Excuse me, ma'am.
How do you like this smell?
It's called L'Eau de Passion.
Nice.
Well, you keep it.
Sorry, my computer's working slow today.
Signal's good.
I'm mapping the system now.
If you outsource, you can cut your customer-service budget by at least 30%.
- Interesting.
- Syd, we've got a problem.
The router is not out here, it's in the building.
Could I come back tomorrow?
I need to think about it.
No, don't go.
Just follow my lead.
Nobody move!
Drop it!
You get on the ground.
You in the pink, come here.
Get down!
Get on the ground!
Watches, jewelry, wallets - in the bag!
Hurry up!
- No reason not to be nice!
- Come on!
All right, now, that's enough for today.
Get up.
If anyone does anything in the next three minutes, she dies.
Let me see this.
- Hey, I saw a watch I liked.
- It's probably a knockoff.
- Renée, what you did...
- You don't approve.
No, it was brilliant.
You should think about joining APO.
- In case you forgot, I'm a criminal.
- We could try for a pardon.
Think about it.
OK.
No.
I was surprised to hear from you.
You made it clear your dealings with us were over.
I read the instructions.
For the serum to work, Nadia's heart needs to be stopped.
Hm.
Only briefly, as I recall.
30 seconds or so.
You're asking me to kill my daughter.
I'm asking you to have faith in Rambaldi.
Rambaldi designed the cure?
Well, given that Nadia's illness stems from his invention, doesn't that make sense?
Surely I don't have to convince you of the genius behind his designs.
You spent decades pursuing his works.
If things had gone differently, you'd be working with us right now.
You'd be there... when we realized his greatest achievement.
You still could be.
My pursuit of Rambaldi is over.
I won't allow it to consume me again.
I'm only here for Nadia.
That's unfortunate.
But we upheld our end of the bargain.
We gave you the cure.
Whether or not you choose to administer it...
It's up to you.
Anna's line just went active.
Marshall and Rachel are standing by to intercept.
- Initiating the back-trace.
- Bringing the optical sats online.
- Allô?
- The weather report says rain.
- That's Kelly Peyton.
- Pinpoint their locations.
- On it.
- Who are you?
That's not important.
Anna Espinosa works for me now.
- I don't do business with strangers.
- You've already been compensated.
I got him.
He's in Zurich, 47-22 north, 8-32 east.
The cage. 12 feet is up.
I'm zooming in now.
I suppose, given yourgenerosity, I could make an exception.
I figured.
There's a bench at the base of the stairs.
Check under it.
- We need Peyton's location.
- I know.
She's routing into too many hubs.
- Can you get a better view?
- Yeah.
I've got it in front of me.
What exactly do you want me to do?
- A message is hidden in the text.
- Page 47.
What sort of message?
A code?
A transfer?
Microdot?
If I knew that, I wouldn't have to pay you.
- Got it.
She's in Barcelona.
- Where?
I don't know.
Give me a sec.
Keep talking, one more minute.
Use the protocol you had with Anna to contact me when you unveil the message hidden on the page.
Barcelona.
That's all we have.
I don't know, Anna.
He sounds a little skittish.
He's the best.
If it exists, he'll find it.
It doesn't make sense.
If this guy was Anna's contact, why is Peyton calling him?
It's unclear.
Now I want you and Marshall to work together.
See if you can ID him.
If we can bring him into custody we can use him to get to Anna.
Reach out to all our contacts in Barcelona.
If Prophet Five has established a new outpost there, perhaps someone's heard.
- What about the message?
- The one buried in 500-year-old paper?
- Are we taking that seriously?
- We've seen too much not to.
Look, we still have a copy of page 47.
I could take it and analyze it.
I'm taking it with me.
You have your assignments.
If anything develops, notify me at once.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Not that you have to tell me.
- Unless you want to.
- I'm going to see Sloane.
He had page 47 in his possession long before it was turned over to the DSR.
Given his obsession with it...
maybe he knows something we don't.
I can't just let you lie there like this.
Not if there's a way to get you back.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
It's the only way.
- I'd move away from her.
- You don't understand.
Stop.
This is not your decision to make, no matter how much she's suffering.
I have to do it now!
Oh, my God.
It's too late.
It was a cure, Jack.
A cure.
It's OK.
It's all right.
It's OK.
It's OK, darling.
You'll be all right.
It's OK.
It's all right.
- She's working with Prophet Five?
- That explains how Anna escaped prison.
But why?
Why would they want her?
- She's good.
- I know.
But Prophet Five has always been low profile.
Anna is on everybody's radar.
Maybe they had to go to her.
Maybe there's something only she can do.
We've identified the man from Zurich.
Moritz Koller.
He used to be an art historian.
Supposedly discovered da Vinci's lost drawings.
- Supposedly?
- He forged them.
- He was completely discredited.
- It looks like he went freelance.
And plenty of criminal organizations are happy to put his talent to good use.
Including Le Corbeau.
- He worked with Renée?
- More than once.
It means she'll know how to find him.
Syd, your father's on line two.
Nadia's awake.
Looking at her like this...
I'm almost afraid to believe it's true.
It must be an overwhelming relief.
Yeah.
I know you have questions, Jack.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to.
But I was afraid for people to know.
Conventional medicine gave up on my daughter.
I couldn't.
I've been funding dozens of back-channel research projects.
Phase one studies using class A drugs.
Methods that no country would condone.
And then one of them paid off.
A study out of Barcelona.
- Barcelona?
- I had no guarantee that it would work.
My options had run out.
- Sydney.
- Is she OK?
She's with the doctor now.
She's doing wonderfully.
- You need me for anything, call the nurse.
- OK.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Everything seems normal.
I need to run some tests.
See if we can determine how Nadia's condition reversed itself.
No.
My daughter has been poked and prodded enough.
If her health is no longer in jeopardy, I want to make arrangements to take her home.
- She deserves her life back.
- I understand.
I'll update her file now and see if we can get her out of here soon.
Thank you.
- Do you want to go in?
- In a minute.
I've a call to return.
Hello?
It's me.
I need you to look into something, off the record.
- Sure.
What is it?
- Sloane's recent activities.
That is, travel itineraries, call logs, meeting reports.
Anything you want me to focus on?
Barcelona.
- Did you find Koller?
- Tom's en route to meet Renée in Paris.
But you called me away from Nadia.
- How much do you know of Nadia's cure?
- Why?
Sloane's travel records indicate he's made several trips to Barcelona.
He was there shortly before Peyton's call.
Sloane told me he acquired the cure in Barcelona, where Prophet Five is based.
We know they've used Nadia's condition to blackmail him in the past.
Perhaps Sloane's association with them didn't end there.
You think he's working with them, they gave him the cure?
- Perhaps in exchange for information.
- Sloane's been breaking protocol, incorrectly logging calls made from APO for months.
Dozens of calls, all of them made to numbers that no longer exist.
He admits using illegal research channels.
Perhaps he's trying to cover it up.
The back-channel research could be a cover for something else.
I know what Sloane is capable of.
You don't have to remind me.
But Nadia has her life back because of him.
Which is why I hope I'm wrong about this.
Do what you have to do.
But until you have something concrete, I will be with my sister.
- You cold?
Want me to get your blanket?
- No.
The air feels good.
OK.
Sydney should be here soon.
I can't wait to spend time with Isabelle.
I'm even looking forward to changing diapers.
- So you're gonna stay at Sydney's?
- Yeah.
I assume so.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.
Ah, let me see her!
She's dying to meet her Aunt Nadia.
Yeah, there!
Hi, beautiful!
Hi!
Well, I'll leave the three of you to enjoy each other's company.
- Where are you going?
- APO.
Jack wants to see me.
I'll be back.
We'll be fine.
Won't we?
Hm?
OK.
Enjoy the sun.
What's happening?
Hi!
Yes!
You wanted to see me.
I arranged for the leave of absence you requested.
The forms are here to sign.
Thank you.
Look, Jack, I realize the timing on this is less than ideal but...
You should be spending this time with Nadia.
Ah.
Well, unfortunately, I'm not sure she feels the same.
- Give it time, Arvin.
- I know.
You're right.
One last thing.
We intercepted a call from Prophet Five.
Turns out Anna gave them page 47.
They're looking for a hidden message encoded in the text.
Were you aware of this?
No.
Apparently, the message is hidden in a substitution cipher.
Marshall believes he's close to decoding it.
I could let you know when we find out.
No.
I think it's better I not be involved.
I understand.
I talked to Marshall.
He'll confirm he's working on page 47 if Sloane goes to him.
And the taps are in place?
- If Sloane alerts Prophet Five, we'll know.
- Thank you.
Any word from Tom?
He's connected with Renée.
They should be making contact with Koller soon.
- We should get this going.
- We're following Koller's protocol.
- It's ten o'clock.
- It's 9:59.
I didn't realize the French were so punctual.
We're not.
It's you Americans who are always in a hurry.
And we get fat, too.
Is there anything else?
Now it's ten o'clock.
Allô?
Renée?
We're on.
We need to meet.
Tonight.
- How's Isabelle?
- She's asleep, finally.
- I'm all yours.
- You shouldn't stay up.
You must be exhausted.
- What about you?
- It's strange.
I've already missed so much time.
I wish I'd been here for you, with all that's happened.
I know.
And I know what it's like to have part of your life taken from you.
For what it's worth, it gets easier.
My father wanted me to stay with him but I couldn't.
Ever since he came into my life, it's always the same.
I don't want to get hurt anymore.
I don't blame you.
You have every right to be guarded.
But... you should know that while you were sick, he was completely devoted to you.
I've never seen him so dedicated to anything.
Even Rambaldi?
From what I've seen, even Rambaldi.
You can stay here as long as you want, so long as you don't mind a crying baby.
Are you crazy?
I love having so much life around me.
It's my dad.
Hey, Dad.
- Sloane set a meet.
- When?
Tonight.
I'm gonna surveil it.
- I thought you should know.
- I'll wait for your call.
What is it?
There's something you should know.
- Nadia.
- Sydney told me what you're doing.
- I want to go with you.
- Sure that's wise?
Whatever you're about to find out about my father, I need to know.
All right.
Let's go.
Security is armed.
Aren't they always?
Just try to buy me a couple more minutes.
Wow.
Uh...
Non?
Si tu veux...
Mm-hm.
Ah.
Il y a juste un peu...
Mm-hm.
Renée.
Almost there.
Three, two...
- I hate that word.
- I'll remember that.
- You finally got the Ford Hybrid.
- Electric.
Comes in handy when you have to be quiet.
Regardless of what we find, I believe your father's feelings for you are genuine.
I wish there was enough room.
Sloane's not the only family you have, you know.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
We can't see anything from here.
Come on.
- What were they saying?
- I couldn't make it out.
We're in.
Sloane took something from in here.
- Clothes?
- Mine.
These are my things.
He was getting them for you.
I don't know what the rest of this is.
- Findings from clinical trials.
- Trials for what?
Studies from a facility in Barcelona.
It appears that I misjudged your father.
Help!
Dear God, someone!
Anyone!
Help!
Are you done yet?
Please.
I don't know what you want from me.
We want information about Anna Espinosa.
I...
I-I can't help you.
Yes, you can.
We know she hired you to decode a message in this.
I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Anna who?
I know you're trying to do right by your client, but we both know you are not cut out to withstand extended interrogation.
You're just some unlucky bookworm who's in way over his head.
- Please don't hurt me!
- Then stop screaming and talk.
I've a meet set with Anna tomorrow, in Ghana.
Does she know what the message was?
No.
- I want to get paid.
- Why wouldn't she pay you?
Anna doesn't like bad news.
The document.
It's a fake.
Very well done but... but a fake.
- And you believe him?
- He has no reason to lie.
He found a small amount of titanium dioxide in the pigment.
That means the document can't be older than 80 years.
Give or take a decade.
How do you wanna proceed?
We keep the meet.
We can still use Moritz and the counterfeit page to bait Anna.
Guess I'll see you in Ghana.
And the real one?
Where is it?
- Nadia.
- I'm sorry.
I should have called.
No, of course not.
I...
Hm.
I thought you were staying at Sydney's.
Sydney went to Ghana.
They're going after Anna.
But that's not the reason I'm here.
I was hoping I could stay with you.
Maybe we can take some time, get to know each other again, if it's OK.
How could you even ask that?
Come in, sweetheart.
This is my favorite sweater.
I remembered.
Thank you.
Chamomile.
You remembered that too.
I need to admit something to you.
I didn't think you'd want to be with me at all.
Especially not after what my actions caused for you.
I've been quite angry.
Well, you have every right to be angry.
Nadia, when I first met you I didn't know how to be a father.
I assumed it meant being needed.
And then I saw you lying in the hospital in that bed, and I realized something.
I realized that I need you more than you will ever need me.
I'm sorry.
I promised myself I wouldn't put any pressure on you.
It's no pressure.
Dinner's almost ready.
- You need some help?
- No.
Let me explain.
- Nadia, you're going to have to trust me.
- You said it was over.
- It's not how it looks.
- You've been lying all along.
I handed everything over to the DSR except for that page.
I couldn't part with it.
I'd spent so much time...
I don't want more excuses.
Just talking about Rambaldi, your face, your voice, it all changes.
- This obsession you have...
- No, it's not an obsession.
It's faith.
Do you have any idea what your faith cost me?
What did you think?
That I was sleeping peacefully?
The last 12 months were an extended nap?
I heard people talking.
I felt tubes being shoved down my throat.
I couldn't open my eyes, I couldn't move, I couldn't scream, but I felt everything.
So forgive me if I don't have much tolerance for your faith.
Nadia.
Please.
- You have to understand.
- I'm done trying to understand you!
You have to make a choice.
Either me or this.
Please, don't make me choose between the two most important things in my life.
I suppose, then, you lose us both.
No!
My God, the message!
- You're not getting it.
- Get out of my way.
- Stop, please.
Stop it!
- Nadia, move.
No!
Nadia.
This place - crazy crowded.
And I'm not talking mall crowded.
People, cars, goats.
That's why Anna chose it.
Hard to surveil.
How are we apprehending her?
Yeah, mm-hm.
Visual aids here, courtesy of Mitchell.
Huh?
Vroom vroom!
OK, um, well, we have Anna, who will be arriving on the main road right here.
Now, uh, let's see.
Dixon and Rachel will be stationed right here.
- Are the exits secured?
- Yeah.
Tom will be cutting off the back, and...
Sydney will - sorry, Syd - be at the entrance.
So here comes Anna...
- Notify me when they have her in custody.
- I wasn't done with the...
- It's fine, thank you.
- The car was...
I get it.
Everybody's getting set up.
When you see Anna, take her out with this.
Government issue.
Never thought I'd have one of these.
- Don't get excited.
It's only a trade gun.
- That's too bad.
Have you given any more thought to my offer?
About APO?
Yeah.
I work better on my own schedule.
- When are you gonna trust me?
- I trust you.
It's everyone else that's the problem.
OK, go.
- Beautiful jewelry for beautiful lady.
- No cash, sorry.
I'm a starving student.
- Is everything all right?
- Wonderful... considering I might get killed today.
Relax.
We've got you covered.
Good.
This will be fine, thank you.
- Target approaching.
- Copy.
Copy that.
What's going on?
She's not getting out.
Something's not right.
Hold your positions.
They're retreating.
- I've lost visual.
- Don't let her escape.
- Anna's car's heading for the entrance.
- Rachel, follow.
- Copy that.
- Renée, block off the back alleys.
- She knows it's an ambush!
- Someone tipped her off.
She's not here!
Repeat:
Anna is not in the car.
Copy.
She must have gotten out.
Let's search the perimeter.
Sydney.
Sydney.
A few days ago, I was absolutely horrified that you would suggest I'd turn against APO, that I would kill my own daughter.
I realize now that both were inevitable, that death is a necessary sacrifice, necessary to complete the final leg of this journey.
I have been preparing for this my whole life.
I knew it was coming.
I have betrayed everyone I ever loved.
But I was chosen.
- We appreciate what you've done.
- This is my road to follow.
Welcome back.
Bad robot!
Previously on "Alias":
I'm offering you the chance to destroy Sydney Bristow.
The moment this assignment is over, we'll give you back your daughter.
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.
You locked her in a train car, and you sprayed her with a chemical agent.
It's all there.
Everything you need to bring Nadia back.
I loaded the Bristow DNA template into the sequencer.
The genetic fluid is primed and ready.
That's not good enough.
Am I a dog whistle?
I said no.
N-o.
That's right.
That's better.
Thank you.
- You Mr. Halbe?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- I hope your trip wasn't too arduous.
- My trip was fine.
It's these marketing people.
BAs, MBAs.
Not a lick of common sense among 'em.
They almost didn't launch my new perfume, L'Eau de Passion.
- They thought the name was tacky.
- It's... a lovely name.
I know.
That's why I always trust my instincts.
And now it's flying off the shelves.
I assure you, we can take care of all your customer-service needs.
I don't want people suffering ten minutes of panflute waiting to order.
Of course not.
Let me show you our main call center.
Wow!
I think I came to the right place.
We got a lead on Anna.
She's routing her calls to a call center in Jaipur using an encrypted router.
She must have spliced one of these onto an outside line.
They have no idea she's piggybacking onto their system.
She's anonymous.
We locate the router, remove the encryption key.
Next time Anna makes a call, we listen in.
- Maybe trace her location.
- What's the approach?
All you need to do is get this perfume bottle within five feet of... a Wi-Fi access point, and then you can just map the phone system.
- We can figure out which line she's using.
- L'Eau de Passion?
- What, you think it's... too tacky?
- I'll work with it.
Soon we'll double our call-volume capacity.
You'll need to triple it when you start getting calls about this.
Stripe is on back order but the heather sprig is available.
Excuse me, ma'am.
How do you like this smell?
It's called L'Eau de Passion.
Nice.
Well, you keep it.
Sorry, my computer's working slow today.
Signal's good.
I'm mapping the system now.
If you outsource, you can cut your customer-service budget by at least 30%.
- Interesting.
- Syd, we've got a problem.
The router is not out here, it's in the building.
Could I come back tomorrow?
I need to think about it.
No, don't go.
Just follow my lead.
Nobody move!
Drop it!
You get on the ground.
You in the pink, come here.
Get down!
Get on the ground!
Watches, jewelry, wallets - in the bag!
Hurry up!
- No reason not to be nice!
- Come on!
All right, now, that's enough for today.
Get up.
If anyone does anything in the next three minutes, she dies.
Let me see this.
- Hey, I saw a watch I liked.
- It's probably a knockoff.
- Renée, what you did...
- You don't approve.
No, it was brilliant.
You should think about joining APO.
- In case you forgot, I'm a criminal.
- We could try for a pardon.
Think about it.
OK.
No.
I was surprised to hear from you.
You made it clear your dealings with us were over.
I read the instructions.
For the serum to work, Nadia's heart needs to be stopped.
Hm.
Only briefly, as I recall.
30 seconds or so.
You're asking me to kill my daughter.
I'm asking you to have faith in Rambaldi.
Rambaldi designed the cure?
Well, given that Nadia's illness stems from his invention, doesn't that make sense?
Surely I don't have to convince you of the genius behind his designs.
You spent decades pursuing his works.
If things had gone differently, you'd be working with us right now.
You'd be there... when we realized his greatest achievement.
You still could be.
My pursuit of Rambaldi is over.
I won't allow it to consume me again.
I'm only here for Nadia.
That's unfortunate.
But we upheld our end of the bargain.
We gave you the cure.
Whether or not you choose to administer it...
It's up to you.
Anna's line just went active.
Marshall and Rachel are standing by to intercept.
- Initiating the back-trace.
- Bringing the optical sats online.
- Allô?
- The weather report says rain.
- That's Kelly Peyton.
- Pinpoint their locations.
- On it.
- Who are you?
That's not important.
Anna Espinosa works for me now.
- I don't do business with strangers.
- You've already been compensated.
I got him.
He's in Zurich, 47-22 north, 8-32 east.
The cage. 12 feet is up.
I'm zooming in now.
I suppose, given yourgenerosity, I could make an exception.
I figured.
There's a bench at the base of the stairs.
Check under it.
- We need Peyton's location.
- I know.
She's routing into too many hubs.
- Can you get a better view?
- Yeah.
I've got it in front of me.
What exactly do you want me to do?
- A message is hidden in the text.
- Page 47.
What sort of message?
A code?
A transfer?
Microdot?
If I knew that, I wouldn't have to pay you.
- Got it.
She's in Barcelona.
- Where?
I don't know.
Give me a sec.
Keep talking, one more minute.
Use the protocol you had with Anna to contact me when you unveil the message hidden on the page.

Not that you have to tell me.
- Unless you want to.
- I'm going to see Sloane.
He had page 47 in his possession long before it was turned over to the DSR.
Given his obsession with it...
maybe he knows something we don't.
I can't just let you lie there like this.
Not if there's a way to get you back.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
It's the only way.
- I'd move away from her.
- You don't understand.
Stop.
This is not your decision to make, no matter how much she's suffering.
I have to do it now!
Oh, my God.
It's too late.
It was a cure, Jack.
A cure.
It's OK.
It's all right.
It's OK.
It's OK, darling.
You'll be all right.
It's OK.
It's all right.
- She's working with Prophet Five?
- That explains how Anna escaped prison.
But why?
Why would they want her?
- She's good.
- I know.
But Prophet Five has always been low profile.
Anna is on everybody's radar.
Maybe they had to go to her.
Maybe there's something only she can do.

No.
My daughter has been poked and prodded enough.
If her health is no longer in jeopardy, I want to make arrangements to take her home.
- She deserves her life back.
- I understand.
I'll update her file now and see if we can get her out of here soon.
Thank you.
- Do you want to go in?
- In a minute.
I've a call to return.
Hello?
It's me.
I need you to look into something, off the record.
- Sure.
What is it?
- Sloane's recent activities.
That is, travel itineraries, call logs, meeting reports.
Anything you want me to focus on?
Barcelona.
- Did you find Koller?
- Tom's en route to meet Renée in Paris.
But you called me away from Nadia.
- How much do you know of Nadia's cure?
- Why?
Sloane's travel records indicate he's made several trips to Barcelona.
He was there shortly before Peyton's call.
Sloane told me he acquired the cure in Barcelona, where Prophet Five is based.
We know they've used Nadia's condition to blackmail him in the past.
Perhaps Sloane's association with them didn't end there.
You think he's working with them, they gave him the cure?
- Perhaps in exchange for information.
- Sloane's been breaking protocol, incorrectly logging calls made from APO for months.
Dozens of calls, all of them made to numbers that no longer exist.
He admits using illegal research channels.
Perhaps he's trying to cover it up.
The back-channel research could be a cover for something else.
I know what Sloane is capable of.
You don't have to remind me.
But Nadia has her life back because of him.
Which is why I hope I'm wrong about this.
Do what you have to do.
But until you have something concrete, I will be with my sister.
- You cold?
Want me to get your blanket?
- No.
The air feels good.
OK.
Sydney should be here soon.
I can't wait to spend time with Isabelle.
I'm even looking forward to changing diapers.
- So you're gonna stay at Sydney's?
- Yeah.
I assume so.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.
Ah, let me see her!
She's dying to meet her Aunt Nadia.
Yeah, there!
Hi, beautiful!
Hi!
Well, I'll leave the three of you to enjoy each other's company.
- Where are you going?
- APO.
Jack wants to see me.
I'll be back.
We'll be fine.
Won't we?
Hm?
OK.
Enjoy the sun.
What's happening?
Hi!
Yes!
You wanted to see me.
I arranged for the leave of absence you requested.
The forms are here to sign.
Thank you.
Look, Jack, I realize the timing on this is less than ideal but...
You should be spending this time with Nadia.
Ah.
Well, unfortunately, I'm not sure she feels the same.
- Give it time, Arvin.
- I know.
You're right.
One last thing.
We intercepted a call from Prophet Five.
Turns out Anna gave them page 47.
They're looking for a hidden message encoded in the text.
Were you aware of this?
No.
Apparently, the message is hidden in a substitution cipher.
Marshall believes he's close to decoding it.
I could let you know when we find out.
No.
I think it's better I not be involved.
I understand.
I talked to Marshall.
He'll confirm he's working on page 47 if Sloane goes to him.
And the taps are in place?
- If Sloane alerts Prophet Five, we'll know.
- Thank you.
Any word from Tom?
He's connected with Renée.
They should be making contact with Koller soon.
- We should get this going.
- We're following Koller's protocol.
- It's ten o'clock.
- It's 9:59.
I didn't realize the French were so punctual.
We're not.
It's you Americans who are always in a hurry.
And we get fat, too.
Is there anything else?
Now it's ten o'clock.
Allô?
Renée?
We're on.
We need to meet.
Tonight.
- How's Isabelle?
- She's asleep, finally.
- I'm all yours.
- You shouldn't stay up.
You must be exhausted.
- What about you?
- It's strange.
I've already missed so much time.
I wish I'd been here for you, with all that's happened.
I know.
And I know what it's like to have part of your life taken from you.
For what it's worth, it gets easier.
My father wanted me to stay with him but I couldn't.
Ever since he came into my life, it's always the same.
I don't want to get hurt anymore.
I don't blame you.
You have every right to be guarded.
But... you should know that while you were sick, he was completely devoted to you.
I've never seen him so dedicated to anything.
Even Rambaldi?
From what I've seen, even Rambaldi.
You can stay here as long as you want, so long as you don't mind a crying baby.
Are you crazy?
I love having so much life around me.
It's my dad.
Hey, Dad.
- Sloane set a meet.
- When?
Tonight.
I'm gonna surveil it.
- I thought you should know.
- I'll wait for your call.
What is it?
There's something you should know.
- Nadia.
- Sydney told me what you're doing.
- I want to go with you.
- Sure that's wise?
Whatever you're about to find out about my father, I need to know.
All right.
Let's go.
Security is armed.
Aren't they always?
Just try to buy me a couple more minutes.
Wow.
Uh...
Non?
Si tu veux...
Mm-hm.
Ah.
Il y a juste un peu...
Mm-hm.
Renée.
Almost there.
Three, two...
- I hate that word.
- I'll remember that.
- You finally got the Ford Hybrid.
- Electric.
Comes in handy when you have to be quiet.
Regardless of what we find, I believe your father's feelings for you are genuine.
I wish there was enough room.
Sloane's not the only family you have, you know.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
We can't see anything from here.
Come on.
- What were they saying?
- I couldn't make it out.
We're in.
Sloane took something from in here.
- Clothes?
- Mine.
These are my things.
He was getting them for you.
I don't know what the rest of this is.
- Findings from clinical trials.
- Trials for what?
Studies from a facility in Barcelona.
It appears that I misjudged your father.
Help!
Dear God, someone!
Anyone!
Help!
Are you done yet?
Please.
I don't know what you want from me.
We want information about Anna Espinosa.
I...
I-I can't help you.
Yes, you can.
We know she hired you to decode a message in this.
I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Anna who?
I know you're trying to do right by your client, but we both know you are not cut out to withstand extended interrogation.
You're just some unlucky bookworm who's in way over his head.
- Please don't hurt me!
- Then stop screaming and talk.
I've a meet set with Anna tomorrow, in Ghana.
Does she know what the message was?
No.
- I want to get paid.
- Why wouldn't she pay you?
Anna doesn't like bad news.
The document.
It's a fake.
Very well done but... but a fake.
- And you believe him?
- He has no reason to lie.
He found a small amount of titanium dioxide in the pigment.
That means the document can't be older than 80 years.
Give or take a decade.
How do you wanna proceed?
We keep the meet.
We can still use Moritz and the counterfeit page to bait Anna.
Guess I'll see you in Ghana.
And the real one?
Where is it?
- Nadia.
- I'm sorry.
I should have called.
No, of course not.
I...
Hm.
I thought you were staying at Sydney's.
Sydney went to Ghana.
They're going after Anna.
But that's not the reason I'm here.
I was hoping I could stay with you.
Maybe we can take some time, get to know each other again, if it's OK.
How could you even ask that?
Come in, sweetheart.
This is my favorite sweater.
I remembered.
Thank you.
Chamomile.
You remembered that too.
I need to admit something to you.
I didn't think you'd want to be with me at all.
Especially not after what my actions caused for you.
I've been quite angry.
Well, you have every right to be angry.
Nadia, when I first met you I didn't know how to be a father.
I assumed it meant being needed.
And then I saw you lying in the hospital in that bed, and I realized something.
I realized that I need you more than you will ever need me.
I'm sorry.
I promised myself I wouldn't put any pressure on you.
It's no pressure.
Dinner's almost ready.
- You need some help?
- No.
Let me explain.
- Nadia, you're going to have to trust me.
- You said it was over.
- It's not how it looks.
- You've been lying all along.
I handed everything over to the DSR except for that page.
I couldn't part with it.
I'd spent so much time...
I don't want more excuses.
Just talking about Rambaldi, your face, your voice, it all changes.
- This obsession you have...
- No, it's not an obsession.
It's faith.
Do you have any idea what your faith cost me?
What did you think?
That I was sleeping peacefully?
The last 12 months were an extended nap?
I heard people talking.
I felt tubes being shoved down my throat.
I couldn't open my eyes, I couldn't move, I couldn't scream, but I felt everything.
So forgive me if I don't have much tolerance for your faith.
Nadia.
Please.
- You have to understand.
- I'm done trying to understand you!
You have to make a choice.
Either me or this.
Please, don't make me choose between the two most important things in my life.
I suppose, then, you lose us both.
No!
My God, the message!
- You're not getting it.
- Get out of my way.
- Stop, please.
Stop it!
- Nadia, move.
No!
Nadia.
This place - crazy crowded.
And I'm not talking mall crowded.
People, cars, goats.
That's why Anna chose it.
Hard to surveil.
How are we apprehending her?
Yeah, mm-hm.
Visual aids here, courtesy of Mitchell.
Huh?
Vroom vroom!
OK, um, well, we have Anna, who will be arriving on the main road right here.
Now, uh, let's see.
Dixon and Rachel will be stationed right here.
- Are the exits secured?
- Yeah.
Tom will be cutting off the back, and...
Sydney will - sorry, Syd - be at the entrance.
So here comes Anna...
- Notify me when they have her in custody.
- I wasn't done with the...
- It's fine, thank you.
- The car was...
I get it.
Everybody's getting set up.
When you see Anna, take her out with this.
Government issue.
Never thought I'd have one of these.
- Don't get excited.
It's only a trade gun.
- That's too bad.
Have you given any more thought to my offer?
About APO?
Yeah.
I work better on my own schedule.
- When are you gonna trust me?
- I trust you.
It's everyone else that's the problem.
OK, go.
- Beautiful jewelry for beautiful lady.
- No cash, sorry.
I'm a starving student.
- Is everything all right?
- Wonderful... considering I might get killed today.
Relax.
We've got you covered.
Good.
This will be fine, thank you.
- Target approaching.
- Copy.
Copy that.
What's going on?
She's not getting out.
Something's not right.
Hold your positions.
They're retreating.
- I've lost visual.
- Don't let her escape.
- Anna's car's heading for the entrance.
- Rachel, follow.
- Copy that.
- Renée, block off the back alleys.
- She knows it's an ambush!
- Someone tipped her off.
She's not here!
Repeat:
Anna is not in the car.
Copy.
She must have gotten out.
Let's search the perimeter.
Sydney.
Sydney.
A few days ago, I was absolutely horrified that you would suggest I'd turn against APO, that I would kill my own daughter.
I realize now that both were inevitable, that death is a necessary sacrifice, necessary to complete the final leg of this journey.
I have been preparing for this my whole life.
I knew it was coming.
I have betrayed everyone I ever loved.
But I was chosen.
- We appreciate what you've done.
- This is my road to follow.
Welcome back.
Bad robot!
Previously on "Alias"...
I'm offering you the chance to destroy Sydney Bristow.
The moment this assignment is over, we'll give you back your daughter.
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.
You locked her in a train car, and you sprayed her with a chemical agent.
It's all there.
Everything you need to bring Nadia back.
I loaded the Bristow DNA template into the sequencer.
The genetic fluid is primed and ready.
That's not good enough.
Am I a dog whistle?
I said no.
N-o.
That's right.
That's better.
Thank you.
- You Mr. Halbe?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- I hope your trip wasn't too arduous.
- My trip was fine.
It's these marketing people.
BAs, MBAs.
Not a lick of common sense among 'em.
They almost didn't launch my new perfume, L'Eau de Passion.
- They thought the name was tacky.
- It's... a lovely name.
I know.
That's why I always trust my instincts.
And now it's flying off the shelves.
I assure you, we can take care of all your customer-service needs.
I don't want people suffering ten minutes of panflute waiting to order.
Of course not.
Let me show you our main call center.
Wow!
I think I came to the right place.
We got a lead on Anna.
She's routing her calls to a call center in Jaipur using an encrypted router.
She must have spliced one of these onto an outside line.
They have no idea she's piggybacking onto their system.
She's anonymous.
We locate the router, remove the encryption key.
Next time Anna makes a call, we listen in.
- Maybe trace her location.
- What's the approach?
All you need to do is get this perfume bottle within five feet of... a Wi-Fi access point, and then you can just map the phone system.
- We can figure out which line she's using.
- L'Eau de Passion?
- What, you think it's... too tacky?
- I'll work with it.
Soon we'll double our call-volume capacity.
You'll need to triple it when you start getting calls about this.
Stripe is on back order but the heather sprig is available.
Excuse me, ma'am.
How do you like this smell?
It's called L'Eau de Passion.
Nice.
Well, you keep it.
Sorry, my computer's working slow today.
Signal's good.
I'm mapping the system now.
If you outsource, you can cut your customer-service budget by at least 30%.
- Interesting.
- Syd, we've got a problem.
The router is not out here, it's in the building.
Could I come back tomorrow?
I need to think about it.
No, don't go.
Just follow my lead.
Nobody move!
Drop it!
You get on the ground.
You in the pink, come here.
Get down!
Get on the ground!
Watches, jewellery, wallets - in the bag!
Hurry up!
- No reason not to be nice!
- Come on!
All right, now, that's enough for today.
Get up.
If anyone does anything in the next three minutes, she dies.
Let me see this.
- Hey, I saw a watch I liked.
- It's probably a knockoff.
- Renee, what you did...
- You don't approve.
No, it was brilliant.
You should think about joining APO.
- In case you forgot, I'm a criminal.
- We could try for a pardon.
Think about it.
OK.
No.
I was surprised to hear from you.
You made it clear your dealings with us were over.
I read the instructions.
For the serum to work, Nadia's heart needs to be stopped.
Hm.
Only briefly, as I recall.
30 seconds or so.
You're asking me to kill my daughter.
I'm asking you to have faith in Rambaldi.
Rambaldi designed the cure?
Well, given that Nadia's illness stems from his invention, doesn't that make sense?
Surely I don't have to convince you of the genius behind his designs.
You spent decades pursuing his works.
If things had gone differently, you'd be working with us right now.
You'd be there... when we realized his greatest achievement.
You still could be.
My pursuit of Rambaldi is over.
I won't allow it to consume me again.
I'm only here for Nadia.
That's unfortunate.
But we upheld our end of the bargain.
We gave you the cure.
Whether or not you choose to administer it...
It's up to you.
Anna's line just went active.
Marshall and Rachel are standing by to intercept.
- Initiating the back-trace.
- Bringing the optical sats online.
- Allo?
- The weather report says rain.
- That's Kelly Peyton.
- Pinpoint their locations.
- On it.
- Who are you?
That's not important.
Anna Espinosa works for me now.
- I don't do business with strangers.
- You've already been compensated.
I got him.
He's in Zurich, 47-22 north, 8-32 east.
The cage. 12 feet is up.
I'm zooming in now.
I suppose.
Given your generosity.
I could make an exception.
I figured.
There's a bench at the base of the stairs.
Check under it.
- We need Peyton's location.
- I know.
She's routing into too many hubs.
- Can you get a better view?
- Yeah.
I've got it in front of me.
What exactly do you want me to do?
- A message is hidden in the text.
- Page 47.
What sort of message?
A code?
A transfer?
Microdot?
If I knew that.
I wouldn't have to pay you.
- Got it.
She's in Barcelona.
- Where?
I don't know.
Give me a sec.
Keep talking, one more minute.
Use the protocol you had with Anna to contact me when you unveil the message hidden on the page.
Barcelona.
That's all we have.
I don't know, Anna.
He sounds a little skittish.
He's the best.
If it exists, he'll find it.
It doesn't make sense.
If this guy was Anna's contact, why is Peyton calling him?
It's unclear.
Now I want you and Marshall to work together.
See if you can ID him.
If we can bring him into custody we can use him to get to Anna.
Reach out to all our contacts in Barcelona.
If Prophet Five has established a new outpost there, perhaps someone's heard.
- What about the message?
- The one buried in 500-year-old paper?
- Are we taking that seriously?
- We've seen too much not to.
Look, we still have a copy of page 47.
I could take it and analyze it.
I'm taking it with me.
You have your assignments.
If anything develops, notify me at once.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Not that you have to tell me.
- Unless you want to.
- I'm going to see Sloane.
He had page 47 in his possession long before it was turned over to the DSR.
Given his obsession with it...
maybe he knows something we don't.
I can't just let you lie there like this.
Not if there's a way to get you back.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
It's the only way.
- I'd move away from her.
- You don't understand.
Stop.
This is not your decision to make, no matter how much she's suffering.
I have to do it now!
Oh, my God.
It's too late.
It was a cure, Jack.
A cure.
It's OK.
It's all right.
It's OK.
It's OK, darling.
You'll be all right.
It's OK.
It's all right.
- She's working with Prophet Five?
- That explains how Anna escaped prison.
But why?
Why would they want her?
- She's good.
- I know.
But Prophet Five has always been low profile.
Anna is on everybody's radar.
Maybe they had to go to her.
Maybe there's something only she can do.
We've identified the man from Zurich.
Moritz Koller.
He used to be an art historian.
Supposedly discovered da Vinci's lost drawings.
- Supposedly?
- He forged them.
- He was completely discredited.
- It looks like he went freelance.
And plenty of criminal organizations are happy to put his talent to good use.
Including Le Corbeau.
- He worked with Renee?
- More than once.
It means she'll know how to find him.
Syd, your father's on line two.
Nadia's awake.
Looking at her like this...
I'm almost afraid to believe it's true.
It must be an overwhelming relief.
Yeah.
I know you have questions, Jack.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to.
But I was afraid for people to know.
Conventional medicine gave up on my daughter.
I couldn't.
I've been funding dozens of back-channel research projects.
Phase one studies using class A drugs.
Methods that no country would condone.
And then one of them paid off.
A study out of Barcelona.
- Barcelona?
- I had no guarantee that it would work.
My options had run out.
- Sydney.
- Is she OK?
She's with the doctor now.
She's doing wonderfully.
- You need me for anything, call the nurse.
- OK.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Everything seems normal.
I need to run some tests.
See if we can determine how Nadia's condition reversed itself.
No.
My daughter has been poked and prodded enough.
If her health is no longer in jeopardy, I want to make arrangements to take her home.
- She deserves her life back.
- I understand.
I'll update her file now and see if we can get her out of here soon.
Thank you.
- Do you want to go in?
- In a minute.
I've a call to return.
Hello?
It's me.
I need you to look into something, off the record.
- Sure.
What is it?
- Sloane's recent activities.
That is, travel itineraries, call logs, meeting reports.
Anything you want me to focus on?
Barcelona.
- Did you find Koller?
- Tom's en route to meet Renee in Paris.
But you called me away from Nadia.
- How much do you know of Nadia's cure?
- Why?
Sloane's travel records indicate he's made several trips to Barcelona.
He was there shortly before Peyton's call.

- Sloane's been breaking protocol, incorrectly logging calls made from APO for months.
Dozens of calls, all of them made to numbers that no longer exist.
He admits using illegal research channels.
Perhaps he's trying to cover it up.
The back-channel research could be a cover for something else.
I know what Sloane is capable of.
You don't have to remind me.
But Nadia has her life back because of him.
Which is why I hope I'm wrong about this.
Do what you have to do.
But until you have something concrete, I will be with my sister.
- You cold?
Want me to get your blanket?
- No.
The air feels good.
OK.
Sydney should be here soon.
I can't wait to spend time with Isabelle.
I'm even looking forward to changing diapers.
- So you're gonna stay at Sydney's?
- Yeah.
I assume so.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.
Ah, let me see her!
She's dying to meet her Aunt Nadia.
Yeah, there!
Hi, beautiful!
Hi!
Well, I'll leave the three of you to enjoy each other's company.

We'll be fine.
Won't we?

- Sydney told me what you're doing.
- I want to go with you.

Let's go.
Security is armed.
Aren't they always?
Just try to buy me a couple more minutes.

Non?
Si tu veux...
Mm-hm.
Ah.
Il y a juste un peu...
Mm-hm.
Renee.
Almost there.
Three.
Two...
- I hate that word.
- I'll remember that.
- You finally got the Ford Hybrid.
- Electric.
Comes in handy when you have to be quiet.
Regardless of what we find, I believe your father's feelings for you are genuine.
I wish there was enough room.
Sloane's not the only family you have, you know.
Thank you.
What are you doing?

Come on.

- I couldn't make it out.
We're in.
Sloane took something from in here.

These are my things.
He was getting them for you.
I don't know what the rest of this is.
- Findings from clinical trials.
- Trials for what?
Studies from a facility in Barcelona.
It appears that I misjudged your father.
Help!
Dear God, someone!
Anyone!
Help!
Are you done yet?
Please.
I don't know what you want from me.
We want information about Anna Espinosa.
I...
I-I can't help you.
Yes, you can.
We know she hired you to decode a message in this.
I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Anna who?
I know you're trying to do right by your client, but we both know you are not cut out to withstand extended interrogation.
You're just some unlucky bookworm who's in way over his head.
- Please don't hurt me!
- Then stop screaming and talk.
I've a meet set with Anna tomorrow, in Ghana.
Does she know what the message was?
No.
- I want to get paid.
- Why wouldn't she pay you?
Anna doesn't like bad news.
The document.
It's a fake.
Very well done but... but a fake.
- And you believe him?
- He has no reason to lie.
He found a small amount of titanium dioxide in the pigment.
That means the document can't be older than 80 years.
Give or take a decade.
How do you wanna proceed?
We keep the meet.
We can still use Moritz and the counterfeit page to bait Anna.
Guess I'll see you in Ghana.
And the real one?
Where is it?
- Nadia.
- I'm sorry.
I should have called.
No, of course not.
I...
Hm.
I thought you were staying at Sydney's.
Sydney went to Ghana.
They're going after Anna.
But that's not the reason I'm here.
I was hoping I could stay with you.
Maybe we can take some time, get to know each other again, if it's OK.
How could you even ask that?
Come in, sweetheart.
This is my favorite sweater.
I remembered.
Thank you.
Chamomile.
You remembered that too.
I need to admit something to you.
I didn't think you'd want to be with me at all.
Especially not after what my actions caused for you.
I've been quite angry.
Well, you have every right to be angry.
Nadia, when I first met you I didn't know how to be a father.
I assumed it meant being needed.
And then I saw you lying in the hospital in that bed, and I realized something.
I realized that I need you more than you will ever need me.
I'm sorry.
I promised myself I wouldn't put any pressure on you.
It's no pressure.
Dinner's almost ready.
- You need some help?
- No.
Let me explain.
- Nadia, you're going to have to trust me.
- You said it was over.
- It's not how it looks.
- You've been lying all along.
I handed everything over to the DSR except for that page.
I couldn't part with it.
I'd spent so much time...
I don't want more excuses.
Just talking about Rambaldi, your face, your voice, it all changes.
- This obsession you have...
- No, it's not an obsession.
It's faith.
Do you have any idea what your faith cost me?
What did you think?
That I was sleeping peacefully?
The last 12 months were an extended nap?
I heard people talking.
I felt tubes being shoved down my throat.
I couldn't open my eyes, I couldn't move, I couldn't scream, but I felt everything.
So forgive me if I don't have much tolerance for your faith.
Nadia.
Please.
- You have to understand.
- I'm done trying to understand you!
You have to make a choice.
Either me or this.
Please, don't make me choose between the two most important things in my life.
I suppose, then, you lose us both.
No!
My God, the message!
- You're not getting it.
- Get out of my way.
- Stop, please.
Stop it!
- Nadia, move.
No!
Nadia.
This place - crazy crowded.
And I'm not talking mall crowded.
People, cars, goats.
That's why Anna chose it.
Hard to surveil.
How are we apprehending her?
Yeah, mm-hm.
Visual aids here, courtesy of Mitchell.
Huh?
Vroom vroom!
OK, um, well, we have Anna, who will be arriving on the main road right here.
Now, uh, let's see.
Dixon and Rachel will be stationed right here.
- Are the exits secured?
- Yeah.
Tom will be cutting off the back, and...
Sydney will - sorry, Syd - be at the entrance.
So here comes Anna...
- Notify me when they have her in custody.
- I wasn't done with the...
- It's fine, thank you.
- The car was...
I get it.
Everybody's getting set up.
When you see Anna, take her out with this.
Government issue.
Never thought I'd have one of these.
- Don't get excited.
It's only a trade gun.
- That's too bad.
Have you given any more thought to my offer?
About APO?
Yeah.
I work better on my own schedule.
- When are you gonna trust me?
- I trust you.
It's everyone else that's the problem.
OK, go.
- Beautiful jewellery for beautiful lady.
- No cash, sorry.
I'm a starving student.
- Is everything all right?
- Wonderful... considering I might get killed today.
Relax.
We've got you covered.
Good.
This will be fine, thank you.
- Target approaching.
- Copy.
Copy that.
What's going on?
She's not getting out.
Something's not right.
Hold your positions.
They're retreating.
- I've lost visual.
- Don't let her escape.
- Anna's car's heading for the entrance.
- Rachel, follow.
- Copy that.
- Renee, block off the back alleys.
- She knows it's an ambush!
- Someone tipped her off.
She's not here!
Repeat:
Anna is not in the car.
Copy.
She must have gotten out.
Let's search the perimeter.
Sydney.
Sydney.
A few days ago.
I was absolutely horrified that you would suggest I'd turn against APO.
That I would kill my own daughter.
I realize now that both were inevitable.
That death is a necessary sacrifice.
Necessary to complete the final leg of this journey.
I have been preparing for this my whole life.
I knew it was coming.
I have betrayed everyone I ever loved.
But I was chosen.
- We appreciate what you've done.
- This is my road to follow.
Welcome back.
I'm offering you the chance to destroy Sydney Bristow.
The moment this assignment is over, we'll give you back your daughter.
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.
You locked her in a train car and you sprayed her with a chemical agent.
It's all there...
Everything you need to bring Nadia back.
We loaded the Bristow DNA template into the sequence.
Her genetic fluid is primed and ready.
Honey, that's not good enough.
What am I, a dog whistle?
I said no.
"N-O." that's right.
That's better.
Thank you.
Mr. Halbe?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Hi!
I hope your trip wasn't too arduous.
My trip was fine.
It's these marketing people.
BAS, MBAS and not a lick of common sense among 'em!
They almost didn't launch my new perfume L'Eau De Passion.
They said the name was tacky.
Can you believe that?
!
It's a lovely name.
I know.
That's why I always trust my instincts, and now it is flying off the shelves, flying!
I assure you, we can take care of all your customer service needs.
I don't want my people suffering through no ten minutes of pan flute to place an order.
Of course not.
Let me show you our main call center.
I think I came to the right place.
We just got a lead on Anna.
She's routing her calls through a call center in Jaipur; using what?
Encrypted router.
She must have put something on a line outside.
So they have no idea she's piggybacking on their system.
She's totally anonymous.
So we locate the router and remove the encryption key.
Next time Anna makes a call, we listen in.
Right, maybe even trace her location.
What's the approach?
All you need to do is get this perfume bottle within 5 feet of... a Wi-Fi access, point.
And then you can just map the phone system.
We can figure out which line she's using.
"L'Eau De Passion"?
What, you think it's... too tacky?
I'll work with it.
Soon, we'll be doubling our call volume capacity.
You're gonna need to triple it when you start getting calls about this baby.
...the Mandarin Stripe is on back order, but the Heather Sprig is available.
Excuse me, ma'am.
How do you like this smell?
It's called L'Eau De Passion.
Nice.
Well, you keep it.
Sorry, my computer's working a little slow today.
Signal's good.
I'm mapping the system now.
If you outsource, you can cut your customer service budget by at least 30%.
Interesting.
Syd...
We've got a problem.
Their router is not out here.
It's in the building.
Could I come back tomorrow?
I need to think about it.
No, don't go.
Just follow my lead.
Nobody move!
Drop it!
You get on the ground.
You in the pink, come here.
Get down!
Get on the ground!
Watches, jewelry, wallets in the bag!
Hurry up!
No reason not to be nice!
Come on!
All right now.
That's enough for today.
Get up.
If anyone does anything in the next three minutes, she dies.
Let me see this.
Hey, I saw a watch I liked.
It's probably a Knockoff.
Renée, what you did back there...
You don't approve.
No, it was brilliant.
You should think about joining APO.
In case you forgot, I'm a criminal.
We could try for a pardon.
You should think about it.
I was surprised to hear from you.
You made it very clear that your dealings with us were over.
I read the instructions.
In order for the serum to work, Nadia's heart needs to be stopped.
Only briefly, as I recall, 30 seconds or so.
You're asking me to kill my daughter.
I'm asking you to have faith in Rambaldi.
You're saying Rambaldi designed the cure?
Well, given that Nadia's illness stems from his invention, doesn't that make sense?
Surely, I don't have to convince you of the genius behind his designs.
You spent decades pursuing his works.
If things had gone differently, you'd be working with us right now.
You'd be there.
When we realized his greatest achievement.
You still could be.
My pursuit of Rambaldi is over.
I won't allow it to consume me again.
I'm only here for Nadia.
That's unfortunate, but we upheld our end of the bargain.
We gave you the cure.
Whether or not you choose to administer it, that's up to you.
Anna's line just went active.
Marshall and Rachel are standing by to intercept.
Initiating the back-trace.
Bringing the optical sats online.
Hello?
Did you bring your umbrella?
The weather report calls for rain.
That's not Anna but Kelly Peyton.
Can you pinpoint the locations?
Already on it.
Who are you?
That's not important.
Anna Espinosa works for me now.
That's all you need to know.
I don't do business with strangers.
Check your account.
You've already been compensated.
I got him.
He's in Zurich. 47-22 north, 8-32 east.
The kh-12 feed is up.
I'm zooming in now.
I suppose given your generosity,
I could make an exception.
I figured.
Check under the bench at the base of the stairs.
We need Peyton's location!
I know, but she's routing it through too many hubs.
Can you get a better view?
Yeah.
I've got it in front of me.
What exactly do you want me to do?
There's a message hidden in the text.
Page 47.
What sort of message?
A code, a transfer, microdot?
If I knew that, I wouldn't have to pay you, would I?
Got it...
Barcelona.
She's in Barcelona.
Where?
I don't know, just give me a sec.
Keep talking. 1 more minute, please.
Use the protocol you had with Anna to contact me when you unveil the message hidden on the page.
Barcelona.
That's all we have.
I don't know, Anna.
He sounds a little skittish.
He's the best.
If it exists, he'll find it.
It doesn't make any sense.
If this guy in Zurich was Anna's contact, why is Peyton the one calling?
It's unclear.
But now I want you and Marshall to work together.
See if you can I.D. him.
If we can bring him into custody, we can use him to get to Anna.
Tom, Dixon, reach out to all our contacts in Barcelona.
If Prophet Five has established a new outpost there, perhaps someone's heard about it.
What about the message?
You mean the one buried in a 500-year-old piece of paper?
Are we taking that seriously?
We've seen too much not to.
Look, we still have a copy of page 47.
I could take it and analyze it and...
I'm taking it with me.
You have your assignments.
If anything develops, notify me at once.
Wait, where are you going?
Not that you have to tell me, unless you want to.
I'm going to see Sloane.
He had page 47 in his possession long before it was turned over to the DSR.
Given his obsession with it, maybe he knows something we don't.
I can't just let you lie here like this, not if there's a way to get you back.
I'm sorry.
God, I'm sorry.
It's the only way.
Move away from her.
You don't understand.
We don't have time.
Stop!
This is not your decision to make, no matter how much she's suffering.
I have to do it now!
Oh, my God.
It's too late.
It was a cure, Jack,
A cure.
It's okay.
It's okay.
We're here.
So she's working with Prophet Five?
Well, that explains how Anna escaped from prison, but why?
I mean, why would they want her?
She's good.
Yeah, I know.
But Prophet Five has always been low profile.
Anna is on everybody's radar.
Maybe they had to go to her.
Maybe there's only something she can do.
We've identified the man from Zurich:
Mortiz Koller.
He used to be an art historian, was kind of a big shot.
Supposedly discovered Da Vinci's lost drawings.
Supposedly?
He forged them.
He was completely discredited.
It looks like he went freelance.
And plenty of criminal organizations are more than happy to put his talent to good use, including Le Corbeau.
He worked with Renée?
More than once.
Well, that means she'll know how to find him.
Syd, your father's on line two.
Nadia's awake.
Looking at her like this,
I'm almost afraid to believe it's true.
It must be an overwhelming relief.
Yeah.
I know you have questions, Jack.
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to, but I was afraid for people to know.
Conventional medicine gave up on my daughter.
I couldn't.
I've been funding dozens of back-channel research projects, phase-one studies using class "A" drugs, methods that no country would condone.
And then one of them paid off...
A study out of Barcelona.
Barcelona?
I had no guarantee that it would work.
My options had run out.
Sydney.
Is she okay?
She's with the doctor now.
She's doing wonderfully.
You need me for anything, you call the nurse, OK?
Hi.
Hi.
Everything seems normal.
I need to run some tests, see if we can determine how...
- Nadia's condition reversed itself.
- No.
My daughter has been poked and prodded enough.
If her health is no longer in jeopardy,
I want to make arrangements to take her home.
She deserves her life back.
I understand.
I'll update her file now and... see if we can get her out of here as soon as possible.
Thank you.
You want to go in?
In a minute.
I have a call to return.
Hello?
It's me.
I need you to look into something, off the record.
Sure.
What is it?
Sloane's recent activities.
That is travel itineraries, call logs, meeting reports.
Anything you want me to focus on?
Barcelona.
Did you find Koller?
Tom's en route to meet Renée in Paris.
But you called me away from Nadia.
Sydney, how much do you know about Nadia's cure?
Why?
Sloane's travel records indicate he's made several trips to Barcelona.
He was there shortly before we intercepted Peyton's call.
Sloane told me he acquired the cure in Barcelona where Prophet Five is based.
We know they've used Nadia's condition to blackmail him in the past.
Perhaps Sloane's association with them didn't end there.
You think he's working with them, that Prophet Five gave him the cure?
Perhaps in exchange for information.
Sloane's been breaking protocol, incorrectly logging phone calls made from A.P.O. for months, dozens of calls, Syd, all of them made to numbers that no longer exist.
He's already admitted to using illegal research channels.
Perhaps he's trying to cover it up.
Or the back-channel research could be a cover for something else.
I know what Sloane is capable of.
You don't have to remind me, but Nadia has her life back because of him.
Which is why I hope I'm wrong about this.
Well, do what you have to do.
But until you have something concrete,
I'll be with my sister.
You cold?
Want me to get you a blanket?
No, the air feels good.
Okay.
Sydney should be here soon.
I can't wait to spend some time with Isabelle.
I'm even looking forward to changing diapers in the middle of the night.
So you're going to stay at Sydney's?
Yeah, I assumed so.
Oh my God.
Let me see her.
Come here, baby.
She's dying to meet her aunt Nadia.
Yeah, there you...
Hi, beautiful.
Well, I'll leave the three of you to enjoy each other's company.
Where are you going?
A.P.O.
Jack wants to see me.
I'll be back.
We'll be fine.
Won't we?
Okay, enjoy the sun.
What's happening?
Hi.
What is it?
You wanted to see me?
I arranged for the leave of absence you requested.
The forms are all here for you to sign.
Thank you.
Look Jack, I realize the timing on this might be less than ideal, but if you need me...
You should be spending this time with Nadia.
Well, unfortunately, I'm not sure if she feels the same.
Give it time, Arvin.
I know.
You're right.
One last thing.
We intercepted a call from Prophet Five.
Turns out Anna gave them page 47.
They're looking for a hidden message encoded in the text.
Were you aware of this?
Apparently, the message is hidden in a substitution cipher.
Marshall believes he's close to decoding it.
I could let you know when we find out.
No.
No, I think it's better I not be involved.
I understand.
I talked to Marshall.
He'll confirm he's working on page 47 if Sloane goes to him.
And the taps are in place?
If Sloane alerts Prophet Five, we'll know.
Thank you.
Any words from Tom?
He's connected with Renée.
They should be making contact with Koller soon.
We should get this going.
We're following Koller's protocol.
It's 10:00.
It's 9:59.
I didn't realize the French were so punctual.
We're not.
It's you Americans who are always in a hurry.
And we get fat, too.
Is there anything else?
Now it's 10:00.
We're on.
We need to meet...
Tonight.
How's Isabelle?
She's asleep, finally.
I'm all yours.
You shouldn't stay up.
You must be exhausted.
Well, what about you?
It's strange.
I've already missed so much time.
I wish I had been here for you, with everything that's happened.
I know.
And I know what it's like to have a part of your life taken from you.
For what it's worth, it gets easier.
My father wanted me to stay with him, but I couldn't.
Ever since he came into my life, it's always the same.
I just don't want to get hurt anymore.
I don't blame you.
You have every right to be guarded.
But...
You should know that while you were sick, he was completely devoted to you.
I mean, I've never seen him so dedicated to anything.
Even Rambaldi?
From what I've seen, even Rambaldi.
You can stay here as long as you want, as long as you don't mind a crying baby.
Are you crazy?
I love having so much life around me.
It's my dad.
- Hey, dad.
- Sloane set a meet.
- When?
- Tonight.
I'm going to surveil it.
I thought you should know.
I'll wait for your call.
What is it?
There's something you should know.
Nadia.
Sydney told me what you're doing.
I want to go with you.
You sure that's wise?
Whatever you're about to find out about my father...
I need to know.
All right, let's go.
Security is armed.
Aren't they always?
Just try to buy me a couple more minutes.
Renée...
Almost there.
Three, two...
I hate that word.
I'll remember that.
You finally got the Ford hybrid.
Electric.
It comes in handy when you have to be quiet.
Regardless of what we find,
I believe your father's feelings for you are genuine.
I wish that was enough for him.
Sloane's not the only family you have, you know.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
We can't see anything from here.
All right.
What were they saying?
I couldn't make it out.
We're in.
Sloane took something from in here.
Clothes?
Mine.
These are my things.
He was getting them for you.
I don't know what the rest of this is.
Findings from clinical trials.
Trials for what?
Studies from a facility in Barcelona.
It appears that I've misjudged your father.
Help!
Dear God, someone!
Anyone!
Help!
Are you done yet?
Please, I don't know what you want from me.
We want information about Anna Espinosa.
I
- I...
I can't help you.
Yes, you can.
We know she hired you to decode a message in this.
I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Anna who?
I know you're trying to do right by your client.
But you and I both know you are not cut out to withstand extended interrogation.
You're just some unlucky bookworm who's in way over his head.
Please, don't hurt me!
Then stop screaming and talk!
I have a meet set with Anna tomorrow... in Ghana.
She knows what the message was?
No.
I want to get paid.
Why wouldn't she pay you?
Anna doesn't like bad news.
The document... it's a fake.
Very well done, but... but a fake.
And you believe him?
He has no reason to lie.
He found a small amount of titanium dioxide in the pigment.
Well, that means the document can't be older than 80 years.
Give or take a decade.
How do you want to proceed?
We keep the meet.
We can still use Moritz and the counterfeit page to bait Anna.
Guess I'll see you in Ghana.
And the real one... where is it?
Nadia...
I'm sorry.
I should have called.
No, of course not.
I...
I thought you were staying at Sydney's.
Sydney went to Ghana.
They're going after Anna.
That's not the reason I'm here.
I was hoping I could stay with you.
Maybe we can take some time, get to know each other again, if it's okay.
How could you even ask that?
Come in, sweetheart.
This is my favorite sweater.
I remembered.
Thank you.
Chamomile.
You remembered that, too.
I need to admit something to you.
I didn't think you'd want to be with me at all.

I promised myself I wouldn't put any pressure on you.
It's no pressure.
Dinner's almost ready.
You need some help?
No.
Let me explain.
Nadia, you're going to have to trust me.
You said it was over.
No, it's not what it looks like.
You've been lying all along.
Look, I handed everything over to the DSR.
except for that page.
I couldn't part with it.
I
- I'd spent so much time...
I don't want more excuses.

No, it's not an obsession.
It's faith.
Do you have any idea what your faith cost me?

I heard people talking.
I felt tubes being shoved down my throat.
I couldn't open my eyes.
I couldn't move.
I couldn't scream.
But I felt everything, so forgive me if I don't have much tolerance for your faith.
Nadia, please!
You have to understand...
I'm done trying to understand you!
You have to make a choice.
Either me or this.
Please, don't make me choose between the two most important things in my life.
I suppose then you'll lose us both.
My god, the message!
I see it.
You're not getting it!
Get out of my way!
No, you can't have it!
I won't let you!
Stop, please!
Stop it!
Nadia, move!
Okay, now this place... crazy crowded.
I'm not talking about mall crowded,
I'm saying like people, cars, goats.
That's why Anna chose it... hard to surveil.
What's the plan?
How are we apprehending her?

Government issue.
I never thought I'd have one of these.
Don't get too excited.
It's only a tranq gun.
That's too bad.
Have you give any more thought to my offer about A.P.O.?
Yeah, I work better on my own schedule.
When are you going to start trusting me?
I trust you.
It's everyone else that's the problem.
Okay, go.
Beautiful jewelry for a beautiful lady.
No cash, sorry.
I'm a starving student.
Is everything all right?
Wonderful, considering I might get killed today.
Relax.
We've got you covered.
This will be fine.
Thank you.
Target approaching.
Copy.
Copy that.
What's going on?
She's not getting out.
Something's not right.
Hold your positions.
They're retreating.
I've lost visual.
Don't let her escape!
Repeat, Anna's car is headed toward the entrance!
- Rachel, follow the car.
- Copy that.
Renée, block off the back alleys.

Someone tipped her off.

Previously on "Alias":
I'm offering you the chance to destroy Sydney Bristow.
The moment this assignment is over, we'll give you back your daughter.
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.
You locked her in a train car, and you sprayed her with a chemical agent.
It's all there.
Everything you need to bring Nadia back.
I loaded the Bristow DNA template into the sequencer.
The genetic fluid is primed and ready.
(Southern US accent) That's not good enough.
Am I a dog whistle?
I said no.
N-o.
That's right.
That's better.
Thank you.
- You Mr. Halbe?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- I hope your trip wasn't too arduous.
- My trip was fine.
It's these marketing people.
BAs, MBAs.
Not a lick of common sense among 'em.
They almost didn't launch my new perfume, L'Eau de Passion.
- They thought the name was tacky.
- It's... a lovely name.
I know.
That's why I always trust my instincts.
And now it's flying off the shelves.
I assure you, we can take care of all your customer-service needs.
I don't want people suffering ten minutes of panflute waiting to order.
Of course not.
Let me show you our main call center.
Wow!
I think I came to the right place.
We got a lead on Anna.
She's routing her calls to a call center in Jaipur using an encrypted router.
She must have spliced one of these onto an outside line.
They have no idea she's piggybacking onto their system.
She's anonymous.
We locate the router, remove the encryption key.
Next time Anna makes a call, we listen in.
- Maybe trace her location.
- What's the approach?
All you need to do is get this perfume bottle within five feet of... a Wi-Fi access point, and then you can just map the phone system.
- We can figure out which line she's using.
- L'Eau de Passion?
- What, you think it's... too tacky?
- I'll work with it.
Soon we'll double our call-volume capacity.
You'll need to triple it when you start getting calls about this.
Stripe is on back order but the heather sprig is available.
Excuse me, ma'am.
How do you like this smell?
It's called L'Eau de Passion.
Nice.
Well, you keep it.
Sorry, my computer's working slow today.
(beeping)
Signal's good.
I'm mapping the system now.
If you outsource, you can cut your customer-service budget by at least 30%.
- lnteresting.
- Syd, we've got a problem.
The router is not out here, it's in the building.
Could I come back tomorrow?
I need to think about it.
No, don't go.
Just follow my lead.
Nobody move!
Drop it!
You get on the ground.
You in the pink, come here.
Get down!
Get on the ground!
Watches, jewelry, wallets - in the bag!
Hurry up!
- (Anna) No reason not to be nice!
- Come on!
All right, now,that'senoughfortoday.
Get up.
If anyone does anything in the next three minutes, she dies.
Let me see this.
- Hey, I saw a watch I liked.
- It's probably a knockoff.
- Renee, what you did...
- You don't approve.
No, it was brilliant.
You should think about joining APO.
- In case you forgot, I'm a criminal.
- We could try for a pardon.
Think about it.
OK.
No.
I was surprised to hear from you.
You made it clear your dealings with us were over.
I read the instructions.
For the serum to work, Nadia's heart needs to be stopped.
Hm.
Only briefly, as I recall.
30 seconds or so.
You're asking me to kill my daughter.
I'm asking you to have faith in Rambaldi.
Rambaldi designed the cure?
Well, given that Nadia's illness stems from his invention, doesn't that make sense?
Surely I don't have to convince you of the genius behind his designs.
You spent decades pursuing his works.
If things had gone differently, you'd be working with us right now.
You'd be there... when we realized his greatest achievement.
You still could be.
My pursuit of Rambaldi is over.
I won't allow it to consume me again.
I'm only here for Nadia.
That's unfortunate.
But we upheld our end of the bargain.
We gave you the cure.
Whether or not you choose to administer it...
It's up to you.
Anna's line just went active.
Marshall and Rachel are standing by to intercept.
- lnitiating the back-trace.
- Bringing the optical sats online.
- (man) Allo?
- (woman) The weather report says rain.
- That's Kelly Peyton.
- Pinpoint their locations.
- On it.
- (French man) Who are you?
(Peyton) That's not important.
Anna Espinosa works for me now.
- (man) I don't do business with strangers.
- You've already been compensated.
I got him.
He's in Zurich, 47-22 north, 8-32 east.
The cage. 1 2 feet is up.
I'm zooming in now.
(man) I suppose. given your generosity.
I could make an exception.
(Peyton) I figured.
There's a bench at the base of the stairs.
Check under it.
- We need Peyton's location.
- I know.
She's routing into too many hubs.
- Can you get a better view?
- Yeah.
(man) I've got it in front of me.
What exactly do you want me to do?
- (Peyton) A message is hidden in the text.
- Page 47.
(man) What sort of message?
A code?
A transfer?
Microdot?
(Peyton) If I knew that.
I wouldn't have to pay you.
- Got it.
She's in Barcelona.
- Where?
I don't know.
Give me a sec.
Keep talking, one more minute.
(Peyton) Use the protocol you had with Anna to contact me when you unveil the message hidden on the page.
Barcelona.
That's all we have.
I don't know, Anna.
He sounds a little skittish.
He's the best.
If it exists, he'll find it.
It doesn't make sense.
If this guy was Anna's contact, why is Peyton calling him?
It's unclear.
Now I want you and Marshall to work together.
See if you can lD him.
If we can bring him into custody we can use him to get to Anna.
Reach out to all our contacts in Barcelona.
If Prophet Five has established a new outpost there, perhaps someone's heard.
- What about the message?
- The one buried in 500-year-old paper?
- Are we taking that seriously?
- We've seen too much not to.
Look, we still have a copy of page 47.
I could take it and analyze it.
I'm taking it with me.
You have your assignments.
If anything develops, notify me at once.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Not that you have to tell me.
- Unless you want to.
- I'm going to see Sloane.
He had page 47 in his possession long before it was turned over to the DSR.
Given his obsession with it...
maybe he knows something we don't.
(machine beeps continuously)
I can't just let you lie there like this.
Not if there's a way to get you back.
I'm sorry.
(machine powers down)
(beeping speeds up)
(beeping speeds up more)
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
It's the only way.
(flatline beep)
(Sloane sobs)
(flatline beep)
- I'd move away from her.
- You don't understand.
Stop.
This is not your decision to make, no matter how much she's suffering.
I have to do it now!
(flatline beep)
(sobs)
Oh, my God.
It's too late.
It was a cure, Jack.
Acure.
(beeping restarts)
It's OK.
It's all right.
(whispers emotionally)
It's OK.
It's OK, darling.
You'll be all right.
It's OK.
It's all right.
- (Dixon) She's working with Prophet Five?
- That explains how Anna escaped prison.
But why?
Why would they want her?
- She's good.
- I know.
But Prophet Five has always been low profile.
Anna is on everybody's radar.
Maybe they had to go to her.
Maybe there's something only she can do.
We've identified the man from Zurich.
Moritz Koller.
He used to be an art historian.
Supposedly discovered da Vinci's lost drawings.
- Supposedly?
- He forged them.
- He was completely discredited.
- It looks like he went freelance.
And plenty of criminal organizations are happy to put his talent to good use.
Including Le Corbeau.
- He worked with Renee?
- More than once.
It means she'll know how to find him.
Syd, your father's on line two.
Nadia's awake.
Looking at her like this...
I'm almost afraid to believe it's true.
It must be an overwhelming relief.
Yeah.
I know you have questions, Jack.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to.
But I was afraid for people to know.
Conventional medicine gave up on my daughter.
I couldn't.
I've been funding dozens of back-channel research projects.
Phase one studies using class A drugs.
Methods that no country would condone.
And then one of them paid off.
A study out of Barcelona.
- Barcelona?
- I had no guarantee that it would work.
- My options had run out.
- (footsteps)
- Sydney.
- Is she OK?
She's with the doctor now.
She's doing wonderfully.
- You need me for anything, call the nurse.
- OK.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Everything seems normal.
I need to run some tests.
See if we can determine how Nadia's condition reversed itself.
No.
My daughter has been poked and prodded enough.
If her health is no longer in jeopardy, I want to make arrangements to take her home.
- She deserves her life back.
- I understand.
I'll update her file now and see if we can get her out of here soon.
Thank you.
- Do you want to go in?
- In a minute.
I've a call to return.
(dials on cell phone)
(man) Hello?
It's me.
I need you to look into something, off the record.
- Sure.
What is it?
- Sloane's recent activities.
That is, travel itineraries, call logs, meeting reports.
Anything you want me to focus on?
Barcelona.
- Did you find Koller?
- Tom's en route to meet Renee in Paris.
But you called me away from Nadia.
- How much do you know of Nadia's cure?
- Why?
Sloane's travel records indicate he's made several trips to Barcelona.
He was there shortly before Peyton's call.
Sloane told me he acquired the cure in Barcelona, where Prophet Five is based.
We know they've used Nadia's condition to blackmail him in the past.
Perhaps Sloane's association with them didn't end there.
You think he's working with them, they gave him the cure?
- Perhaps in exchange for information.
- Sloane's been breaking protocol, incorrectly logging calls made from APO for months.
Dozens of calls, all of them made to numbers that no longer exist.
He admits using illegal research channels.
Perhaps he's trying to cover it up.
The back-channel research could be a cover for something else.
I know what Sloane is capable of.
You don't have to remind me.
But Nadia has her life back because of him.
Which is why I hope I'm wrong about this.
Do what you have to do.
But until you have something concrete, I will be with my sister.
- You cold?
Want me to get your blanket?
- No.
The air feels good.
OK.
Sydney should be here soon.
I can't wait to spend time with Isabelle.
I'm even looking forward to changing diapers.
- So you're gonna stay at Sydney's?
- Yeah.
I assume so.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.
Ah, letmesee her!
She's dying to meet her Aunt Nadia.
- (gasps)
- Yeah, there!
Hi, beautiful!
Hi!
Well, I'll leave the three of you to enjoy each other's company.
- Where are you going?
- APO.
Jack wants to see me.
I'll be back.
We'll be fine.
Won't we?
Hm?
OK.
Enjoy the sun.
(Nadia) What's happening?
Hi!
Yes!
(cooing)
You wanted to see me.
I arranged for the leave of absence you requested.
The forms are here to sign.
Thank you.
Look, Jack, I realize the timing on this is less than ideal but...
You should be spending this time with Nadia.
Ah.
Well, unfortunately, I'm not sure she feels the same.
- Give it time, Arvin.
- I know.
You're right.
One last thing.
We intercepted a call from Prophet Five.
Turns out Anna gave them page 47.
They're looking for a hidden message encoded in the text.
Were you aware of this?
No.
Apparently, the message is hidden in a substitution cipher.
Marshall believes he's close to decoding it.
I could let you know when we find out.
No.
I think it's better I not be involved.
I understand.
I talked to Marshall.
He'll confirm he's working on page 47 if Sloane goes to him.
And the taps are in place?
- If Sloane alerts Prophet Five, we'll know.
- Thank you.
Any word from Tom?
He's connected with Renee.
They should be making contact with Koller soon.
- We should get this going.
- We're following Koller's protocol.
- It's ten o'clock.
- It's 9':59.
I didn't realize the French were so punctual.
We're not.
It's you Americans who are always in a hurry.
And we get fat, too.
Is there anything else?
(bell chimes)
- Now it's ten o'clock.
- (cell phone beeps)
(phone rings)
Allo?
(speaking French)
Renee?
We're on.
(sighs)
(dials)
We need to meet.
Tonight.
- How's Isabelle?
- She's asleep, finally.
- I'm all yours.
- You shouldn't stay up.
You must be exhausted.
- What about you?
- It's strange.
I've already missed so much time.
I wish I'd been here for you, with all that's happened.
I know.
And I know what it's like to have part of your life taken from you.
For what it's worth, it gets easier.
My father wanted me to stay with him but I couldn't.
Ever since he came into my life, it's always the same.
I don't want to get hurt anymore.
I don't blame you.
You have every right to be guarded.
But... you should know that while you were sick, he was completely devoted to you.
I've never seen him so dedicated to anything.
Even Rambaldi?
From what I've seen, even Rambaldi.
You can stay here as long as you want, so long as you don't mind a crying baby.
Are you crazy?
I love having so much life around me.
(phone rings)
It's my dad.
Hey, Dad.
- Sloane set a meet.
- When?
Tonight.
I'm gonna surveil it.
- I thought you should know.
- I'll wait for your call.
What is it?
There's something you should know.
(central locking beeps)
- Nadia.
- Sydney told me what you're doing.
- I want to go with you.
- Sure that's wise?
Whatever you're about to find out about my father, I need to know.
All right.
Let'sgo.
(speaks French)
- (radio beeps)
- Security is armed.
Aren't they always?
Just try to buy me a couple more minutes.
(# "Practice What You Preach" by Barry White on stereo)
(speaks French)
Wow.
Uh...
Non?
Si tu veux...
Mm-hm.
- Ah.
Il y a juste un peu...
- (cork pops)
Mm-hm.
Renee.
Almost there.
(Tom on radio) Three. two...
- I hate that word.
- I'll remember that.
- (Nadia) You finally got the Ford Hybrid.
- Electric.
Comes in handy when you have to be quiet.
Regardless of what we find, I believe your father's feelings for you are genuine.
I wish there was enough room.
Sloane's not the only family you have, you know.
Thank you.
- (unbuckles belt)
- What are you doing?
We can't see anything from here.
Come on.
- What were they saying?
- I couldn't make it out.
- (clunk)
- We're in.
Sloane took something from in here.
- Clothes?
- Mine.
These are my things.
He was getting them for you.
I don't knowwhat the rest of this is.
- Findings from clinical trials.
- Trials for what?
Studies from a facility in Barcelona.
It appears that I misjudged your father.
Help!
Dear God, someone!
Anyone!
Help!
Are you done yet?
Please.
I don't know what you want from me.
We want information about Anna Espinosa.
I...
I-I can't help you.
Yes, you can.
We know she hired you to decode a message in this.
I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Anna who?
I know you're trying to do right by your client, but we both know you are not cut out to withstand extended interrogation.
You're just some unlucky bookworm who's in way over his head.
- Please don't hurt me!
- Then stop screaming and talk.
I've a meet set with Anna tomorrow, in Ghana.
Does she know what the message was?
No.
- I want to get paid.
- Why wouldn't she pay you?
Annadoesn'tlike bad news.
The document.
It's a fake.
Very well done but... but a fake.
- And you believe him?
- (Tom) He has no reason to lie.
He found a small amount of titanium dioxide in the pigment.
That means the document can't be older than 80 years.
Give or take a decade.
How do you wanna proceed?
We keep the meet.
We can still use Moritz and the counterfeit page to bait Anna.
Guess I'll see you in Ghana.
Andthe real one?
Where is it?
(door bell)
- Nadia.
- I'm sorry.
I should have called.
No, of course not.
I...
Hm.
I thought you were staying at Sydney's.
Sydney went to Ghana.
They're going after Anna.
But that's not the reason I'm here.
I was hoping I could stay with you.
Maybe we can take some time, get to know each other again, if it's OK.
How could you even ask that?
Come in, sweetheart.
This is my favorite sweater.
I remembered.
Thank you.
Chamomile.
You remembered that too.
I need to admit something to you.
I didn't think you'd want to be with me at all.
Especially not after what my actions caused for you.
I've been quite angry.
Well, you have every right to be angry.
Nadia, when I first met you I didn't know how to be a father.
I assumed it meant being needed.
And then I saw you lying in the hospital in that bed, and I realized something.
I realized that I need you more than you will ever need me.
I'm sorry.
I promised myself I wouldn't put any pressure on you.
It's no pressure.
Dinner's almost ready.
- You need some help?
- No.
Let me explain.
- Nadia, you're going to have to trust me.
- You said it was over.
- It's not how it looks.
- You've been lying all along.
I handed everything over to the DSR except for that page.
I couldn't part with it.
I'd spent so much time...
I don't want more excuses.
Just talking about Rambaldi, your face, your voice, it all changes.
- This obsession you have...
- No, it's not an obsession.
It's faith.
Do you have any idea what your faith cost me?
What did you think?
That I was sleeping peacefully?
The last 1 2 months were an extended nap?
I heard people talking.
I felt tubes being shoved down my throat.
I couldn't open my eyes, I couldn't move, I couldn't scream, but I felt everything.
So forgive me if I don't have much tolerance for your faith.
Nadia.
Please.
- You have to understand.
- I'm done trying to understand you!
You have to make a choice.
Either me or this.
Please, don't make me choose between the two most important things in my life.
I suppose, then, you lose us both.
No!
My God, the message!
- You're not getting it.
- Get out of my way.
- Stop, please.
Stop it!
- Nadia, move.
(Sloane) No!
Nadia.
(breathes shakily)
This place - crazy crowded.
And I'm not talking mall crowded.
People, cars, goats.
That's why Anna chose it.
Hard to surveil.
How are we apprehending her?
Yeah, mm-hm.
Visual aids here, courtesy of Mitchell.
Huh?
Vroom vroom!
OK, um, well, we have Anna, who will be arriving on the main road right here.
Now, uh, let's see.
Dixon and Rachel will be stationed right here.
- Are the exits secured?
- Yeah.
Tom will be cutting off the back, and...
Sydney will - sorry, Syd - be at the entrance.
So here comes Anna...
- Notify me when they have her in custody.
- I wasn't done with the...
- It's fine, thank you.
- The car was...
I get it.
Everybody's getting set up.
When you see Anna, take her out with this.
Government issue.
Never thought I'd have one of these.
- Don't get excited.
It's only a trade gun.
- That's too bad.
Have you given any more thought to my offer?
About APO?
Yeah.
I work better on my own schedule.
- When are you gonna trust me?
- I trust you.
It's everyone else that's the problem.
OK, go.
- Beautiful jewelry for beautiful lady.
- No cash, sorry.
I'm a starving student.
- Is everything all right?
- Wonderful... considering I might get killed today.
Relax.
We've got you covered.
Good.
This will be fine, thank you.
- Target approaching.
- Copy.
Copy that.
(Renee) What's going on?
She's not getting out.
(Dixon) Something's not right.
(Sydney on radio) Hold your positions.
- They're retreating.
- (man shouts)
(man shouts. woman screams)
- (Renee) I've lost visual.
- (Dixon) Don't let her escape.
- Anna's car's heading for the entrance.
- (Sydney) Rachel, follow.
- Copy that.
- Renee, block off the back alleys.
- (Dixon) She knows it's an ambush!
- (Tom) Someone tipped her off.
She's not here!
Repeat:
Anna is not in the car.
Copy.
She must have gotten out.
Let's search the perimeter.
Sydney.
(whispers) Sydney.
(Sloane) A few days ago.
I was absolutely horrified that you would suggest I'd turn against APO.
that I would kill my own daughter.
I realize now that both were inevitable.
that death is a necessary sacrifice.
necessary to complete the final leg of this journey.
I have been preparing for this my whole life.
I knew it was coming.
I have betrayed everyone I ever loved.
But I was chosen.
- (man) We appreciate what you've done.
- This is my road to follow.
Welcome back.
(children) Bad robot!
Previously on "Alias"...
I'm offering you the chance to destroy Sydney Bristow.
The moment this assignment is over, we'll give you back your daughter.
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.
You locked her in a train car, and you sprayed her with a chemical agent.

That's better.

- It's a pleasure to meet you.

- My trip was fine.
It's these marketing people.
BAs, MBAs.
Not a lick of common sense among 'em.

I assure you, we can take care of all your customer-service needs.
I don't want people suffering ten minutes of panflute waiting to order.
Of course not.
Let me show you our main call center.
Wow!
I think I came to the right place.
We got a lead on Anna.

- I'll work with it.
Soon we'll double our call-volume capacity.
You'll need to triple it when you start getting calls about this.
Stripe is on back order but the heather sprig is available.
Excuse me, ma'am.
How do you like this smell?
It's called L'Eau de Passion.
Nice.
Well, you keep it.
Sorry, my computer's working slow today.
Signal's good.
I'm mapping the system now.
If you outsource, you can cut your customer-service budget by at least 30%.
- Interesting.
- Syd, we've got a problem.
The router is not out here, it's in the building.
Could I come back tomorrow?
I need to think about it.
No, don't go.
Just follow my lead.
Nobody move!
Drop it!
You get on the ground.
You in the pink, come here.
Get down!
Get on the ground!
Watches, jewellery, wallets - in the bag!
Hurry up!
- No reason not to be nice!
- Come on!
All right, now, that's enough for today.
Get up.
If anyone does anything in the next three minutes, she dies.
Let me see this.
- Hey, I saw a watch I liked.
- It's probably a knockoff.
- Renee, what you did...
- You don't approve.
No, it was brilliant.
You should think about joining APO.
- In case you forgot, I'm a criminal.
- We could try for a pardon.

No.

For the serum to work, Nadia's heart needs to be stopped.
Hm.
Only briefly, as I recall.

You're asking me to kill my daughter.
I'm asking you to have faith in Rambaldi.
Rambaldi designed the cure?
Well, given that Nadia's illness stems from his invention, doesn't that make sense?

You spent decades pursuing his works.

My pursuit of Rambaldi is over.
I won't allow it to consume me again.
I'm only here for Nadia.
That's unfortunate.
But we upheld our end of the bargain.
We gave you the cure.
Whether or not you choose to administer it...
It's up to you.
Anna's line just went active.
Marshall and Rachel are standing by to intercept.
- Initiating the back-trace.
- Bringing the optical sats online.
- Allo?
- The weather report says rain.
- That's Kelly Peyton.
- Pinpoint their locations.
- On it.
- Who are you?
That's not important.
Anna Espinosa works for me now.
- I don't do business with strangers.
- You've already been compensated.
I got him.
He's in Zurich, 47-22 north, 8-32 east.
The cage. 12 feet is up.
I'm zooming in now.
I suppose.
Given your generosity.
I could make an exception.
I figured.
There's a bench at the base of the stairs.
Check under it.
- We need Peyton's location.
- I know.
She's routing into too many hubs.
- Can you get a better view?
- Yeah.
I've got it in front of me.
What exactly do you want me to do?
- A message is hidden in the text.
- Page 47.
What sort of message?
A code?
A transfer?
Microdot?
If I knew that.
I wouldn't have to pay you.
- Got it.
She's in Barcelona.
- Where?
I don't know.
Give me a sec.
Keep talking, one more minute.
Use the protocol you had with Anna to contact me when you unveil the message hidden on the page.
Barcelona.
That's all we have.
I don't know, Anna.
He sounds a little skittish.
He's the best.
If it exists, he'll find it.
It doesn't make sense.
If this guy was Anna's contact, why is Peyton calling him?
It's unclear.
Now I want you and Marshall to work together.
See if you can ID him.
If we can bring him into custody we can use him to get to Anna.
Reach out to all our contacts in Barcelona.
If Prophet Five has established a new outpost there, perhaps someone's heard.
- What about the message?
- The one buried in 500-year-old paper?
- Are we taking that seriously?
- We've seen too much not to.
Look, we still have a copy of page 47.
I could take it and analyze it.
I'm taking it with me.
You have your assignments.
If anything develops, notify me at once.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Not that you have to tell me.
- Unless you want to.
- I'm going to see Sloane.
He had page 47 in his possession long before it was turned over to the DSR.
Given his obsession with it...
maybe he knows something we don't.
I can't just let you lie there like this.
Not if there's a way to get you back.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
It's the only way.
- I'd move away from her.
- You don't understand.
Stop.
This is not your decision to make, no matter how much she's suffering.
I have to do it now!
Oh, my God.
It's too late.
It was a cure, Jack.
A cure.
It's OK.
It's all right.
It's OK.
It's OK, darling.
You'll be all right.
It's OK.
It's all right.
- She's working with Prophet Five?
- That explains how Anna escaped prison.
But why?
Why would they want her?
- She's good.
- I know.
But Prophet Five has always been low profile.
Anna is on everybody's radar.
Maybe they had to go to her.
Maybe there's something only she can do.
We've identified the man from Zurich.
Moritz Koller.
He used to be an art historian.
Supposedly discovered da Vinci's lost drawings.
- Supposedly?
- He forged them.
- He was completely discredited.
- It looks like he went freelance.
And plenty of criminal organizations are happy to put his talent to good use.
Including Le Corbeau.
- He worked with Renee?
- More than once.
It means she'll know how to find him.
Syd, your father's on line two.
Nadia's awake.
Looking at her like this...
I'm almost afraid to believe it's true.
It must be an overwhelming relief.
Yeah.
I know you have questions, Jack.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to.
But I was afraid for people to know.
Conventional medicine gave up on my daughter.
I couldn't.
I've been funding dozens of back-channel research projects.
Phase one studies using class A drugs.
Methods that no country would condone.
And then one of them paid off.
A study out of Barcelona.
- Barcelona?
- I had no guarantee that it would work.
My options had run out.
- Sydney.
- Is she OK?
She's with the doctor now.
She's doing wonderfully.
- You need me for anything, call the nurse.
- OK.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Everything seems normal.
I need to run some tests.
See if we can determine how Nadia's condition reversed itself.
No.
My daughter has been poked and prodded enough.
If her health is no longer in jeopardy, I want to make arrangements to take her home.
- She deserves her life back.
- I understand.
I'll update her file now and see if we can get her out of here soon.
Thank you.
- Do you want to go in?
- In a minute.
I've a call to return.
Hello?
It's me.
I need you to look into something, off the record.
- Sure.
What is it?
- Sloane's recent activities.
That is, travel itineraries, call logs, meeting reports.
Anything you want me to focus on?
Barcelona.
- Did you find Koller?
- Tom's en route to meet Renee in Paris.
But you called me away from Nadia.
- How much do you know of Nadia's cure?
- Why?
Sloane's travel records indicate he's made several trips to Barcelona.
He was there shortly before Peyton's call.
Sloane told me he acquired the cure in Barcelona, where Prophet Five is based.
We know they've used Nadia's condition to blackmail him in the past.
Perhaps Sloane's association with them didn't end there.
You think he's working with them, they gave him the cure?
- Perhaps in exchange for information.
- Sloane's been breaking protocol, incorrectly logging calls made from APO for months.
Dozens of calls, all of them made to numbers that no longer exist.
He admits using illegal research channels.
Perhaps he's trying to cover it up.
The back-channel research could be a cover for something else.
I know what Sloane is capable of.
You don't have to remind me.
But Nadia has her life back because of him.
Which is why I hope I'm wrong about this.
Do what you have to do.
But until you have something concrete, I will be with my sister.
- You cold?
Want me to get your blanket?
- No.
The air feels good.
OK.
Sydney should be here soon.
I can't wait to spend time with Isabelle.
I'm even looking forward to changing diapers.
- So you're gonna stay at Sydney's?
- Yeah.
I assume so.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.
Ah, let me see her!
She's dying to meet her Aunt Nadia.
Yeah, there!
Hi, beautiful!
Hi!
Well, I'll leave the three of you to enjoy each other's company.
- Where are you going?
- APO.
Jack wants to see me.
I'll be back.
We'll be fine.
Won't we?
Hm?
OK.
Enjoy the sun.
What's happening?
Hi!
Yes!
You wanted to see me.
I arranged for the leave of absence you requested.
The forms are here to sign.
Thank you.
Look, Jack, I realize the timing on this is less than ideal but...
You should be spending this time with Nadia.
Ah.
Well, unfortunately, I'm not sure she feels the same.
- Give it time, Arvin.
- I know.
You're right.
One last thing.
We intercepted a call from Prophet Five.
Turns out Anna gave them page 47.
They're looking for a hidden message encoded in the text.
Were you aware of this?
No.
Apparently, the message is hidden in a substitution cipher.
Marshall believes he's close to decoding it.
I could let you know when we find out.
No.
I think it's better I not be involved.
I understand.
I talked to Marshall.
He'll confirm he's working on page 47 if Sloane goes to him.
And the taps are in place?
- If Sloane alerts Prophet Five, we'll know.
- Thank you.
Any word from Tom?
He's connected with Renee.
They should be making contact with Koller soon.
- We should get this going.
- We're following Koller's protocol.
- It's ten o'clock.
- It's 9:59.
I didn't realize the French were so punctual.
We're not.
It's you Americans who are always in a hurry.
And we get fat, too.
Is there anything else?
Now it's ten o'clock.
Allo?
Renee?
We're on.
We need to meet.
Tonight.
- How's Isabelle?
- She's asleep, finally.
- I'm all yours.
- You shouldn't stay up.
You must be exhausted.
- What about you?
- It's strange.
I've already missed so much time.
I wish I'd been here for you, with all that's happened.
I know.
And I know what it's like to have part of your life taken from you.
For what it's worth, it gets easier.
My father wanted me to stay with him but I couldn't.
Ever since he came into my life, it's always the same.
I don't want to get hurt anymore.
I don't blame you.
You have every right to be guarded.
But... you should know that while you were sick, he was completely devoted to you.
I've never seen him so dedicated to anything.
Even Rambaldi?
From what I've seen, even Rambaldi.
You can stay here as long as you want, so long as you don't mind a crying baby.
Are you crazy?
I love having so much life around me.
It's my dad.
Hey, Dad.
- Sloane set a meet.
- When?
Tonight.
I'm gonna surveil it.
- I thought you should know.
- I'll wait for your call.
What is it?
There's something you should know.
- Nadia.
- Sydney told me what you're doing.
- I want to go with you.
- Sure that's wise?
Whatever you're about to find out about my father, I need to know.
All right.
Let's go.
Security is armed.
Aren't they always?
Just try to buy me a couple more minutes.
Wow.
Uh...
Non?
Si tu veux...
Mm-hm.
Ah.
Il y a juste un peu...
Mm-hm.
Renee.
Almost there.
Three.
Two...
- I hate that word.
- I'll remember that.
- You finally got the Ford Hybrid.
- Electric.
Comes in handy when you have to be quiet.
Regardless of what we find, I believe your father's feelings for you are genuine.
I wish there was enough room.
Sloane's not the only family you have, you know.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
We can't see anything from here.
Come on.
- What were they saying?
- I couldn't make it out.
We're in.
Sloane took something from in here.
- Clothes?
- Mine.
These are my things.
He was getting them for you.
I don't know what the rest of this is.
- Findings from clinical trials.
- Trials for what?
Studies from a facility in Barcelona.
It appears that I misjudged your father.
Help!
Dear God, someone!
Anyone!
Help!
Are you done yet?
Please.
I don't know what you want from me.
We want information about Anna Espinosa.
I...
I-I can't help you.
Yes, you can.
We know she hired you to decode a message in this.
I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Anna who?
I know you're trying to do right by your client, but we both know you are not cut out to withstand extended interrogation.
You're just some unlucky bookworm who's in way over his head.
- Please don't hurt me!
- Then stop screaming and talk.
I've a meet set with Anna tomorrow, in Ghana.
Does she know what the message was?
No.
- I want to get paid.
- Why wouldn't she pay you?
Anna doesn't like bad news.
The document.
It's a fake.
Very well done but... but a fake.
- And you believe him?
- He has no reason to lie.
He found a small amount of titanium dioxide in the pigment.
That means the document can't be older than 80 years.
Give or take a decade.
How do you wanna proceed?
We keep the meet.
We can still use Moritz and the counterfeit page to bait Anna.
Guess I'll see you in Ghana.
And the real one?
Where is it?
- Nadia.
- I'm sorry.
I should have called.
No, of course not.
I...
Hm.
I thought you were staying at Sydney's.
Sydney went to Ghana.
They're going after Anna.
But that's not the reason I'm here.
I was hoping I could stay with you.
Maybe we can take some time, get to know each other again, if it's OK.
How could you even ask that?
Come in, sweetheart.
This is my favorite sweater.
I remembered.
Thank you.
Chamomile.
You remembered that too.
I need to admit something to you.
I didn't think you'd want to be with me at all.
Especially not after what my actions caused for you.
I've been quite angry.
Well, you have every right to be angry.
Nadia, when I first met you I didn't know how to be a father.
I assumed it meant being needed.
And then I saw you lying in the hospital in that bed, and I realized something.
I realized that I need you more than you will ever need me.
I'm sorry.
I promised myself I wouldn't put any pressure on you.
It's no pressure.
Dinner's almost ready.
- You need some help?
- No.
Let me explain.
- Nadia, you're going to have to trust me.
- You said it was over.
- It's not how it looks.
- You've been lying all along.
I handed everything over to the DSR except for that page.
I couldn't part with it.
I'd spent so much time...
I don't want more excuses.
Just talking about Rambaldi, your face, your voice, it all changes.
- This obsession you have...
- No, it's not an obsession.
It's faith.
Do you have any idea what your faith cost me?
What did you think?
That I was sleeping peacefully?
The last 12 months were an extended nap?
I heard people talking.
I felt tubes being shoved down my throat.
I couldn't open my eyes, I couldn't move, I couldn't scream, but I felt everything.
So forgive me if I don't have much tolerance for your faith.
Nadia.
Please.
- You have to understand.
- I'm done trying to understand you!
You have to make a choice.
Either me or this.
Please, don't make me choose between the two most important things in my life.
I suppose, then, you lose us both.
No!
My God, the message!
- You're not getting it.
- Get out of my way.
- Stop, please.
Stop it!
- Nadia, move.
No!
Nadia.
This place - crazy crowded.
And I'm not talking mall crowded.
People, cars, goats.
That's why Anna chose it.
Hard to surveil.
How are we apprehending her?
Yeah, mm-hm.
Visual aids here, courtesy of Mitchell.
Huh?
Vroom vroom!
OK, um, well, we have Anna, who will be arriving on the main road right here.
Now, uh, let's see.
Dixon and Rachel will be stationed right here.
- Are the exits secured?
- Yeah.
Tom will be cutting off the back, and...
Sydney will - sorry, Syd - be at the entrance.
So here comes Anna...
- Notify me when they have her in custody.
- I wasn't done with the...
- It's fine, thank you.
- The car was...
I get it.
Everybody's getting set up.
When you see Anna, take her out with this.
Government issue.
Never thought I'd have one of these.
- Don't get excited.
It's only a trade gun.
- That's too bad.
Have you given any more thought to my offer?
About APO?
Yeah.
I work better on my own schedule.
- When are you gonna trust me?
- I trust you.
It's everyone else that's the problem.
OK, go.
- Beautiful jewellery for beautiful lady.
- No cash, sorry.
I'm a starving student.
- Is everything all right?
- Wonderful... considering I might get killed today.
Relax.
We've got you covered.
Good.
This will be fine, thank you.
- Target approaching.
- Copy.
Copy that.
What's going on?
She's not getting out.
Something's not right.
Hold your positions.
They're retreating.
- I've lost visual.
- Don't let her escape.
- Anna's car's heading for the entrance.
- Rachel, follow.
- Copy that.
- Renee, block off the back alleys.
- She knows it's an ambush!
- Someone tipped her off.
She's not here!
Repeat:
Anna is not in the car.
Copy.
She must have gotten out.
Let's search the perimeter.
Sydney.
Sydney.
A few days ago.
I was absolutely horrified that you would suggest I'd turn against APO.
That I would kill my own daughter.
I realize now that both were inevitable.
That death is a necessary sacrifice.
Necessary to complete the final leg of this journey.
I have been preparing for this my whole life.
I knew it was coming.
I have betrayed everyone I ever loved.
But I was chosen.
- We appreciate what you've done.
- This is my road to follow.
Welcome back.
At this moment, there are six billion, 502 million,
867, 120 people in the world,
give or take a few.
And sometimes, all you need is one.
For better, or for worse.
Help me!
- How long you been out here?
- A couple hours.
Sometimes, I come out here when I can't sleep.
- You miss it?
- Every day.
- So what's up?
- I had this messed up dream last night.
Haley was drowning, and I couldn't save her.
Of course, leave it to Haley to insist that we don't see each other until the wedding, even though we're married.
Maybe I should just go see her.
I'll tell you what, I'll go check on her for you, how's that?
Well, tell her to stay away from the water, okay?
No swimming or anything.
Nathan, it's your wedding day.
Again.
- It's gonna be a great day.
- Thanks.
You're closer than 100 feet.
Just paying my respects.
You know, everyone thinks of Keith as this perfect guy,
- but they're wrong.
- No, they're not, Dan.
Keith is a hero.
He tried to kill me.
That's right.
He's the one who tried to burn me in the dealership fire.
So I guess the hero got what was coming to him, after all.
Knock, knock!
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.
- How is the bride-to-be?
- Oh, good.
Good.
Well, I'm afraid you've missed the boys.
They were gone pretty early.
Oh, that's okay.
I wanted to see you, actually.
- I have a question for you.
- Okay.
Okay, Brooke made me this dress, and it is out of the material
that she ordered for your wedding dress, and I just wanted to ask you if it was okay if I wore it.
And if it's not, that's fine, she made another one that I can wear...
I'm so proud of you, Haley.
Have I told you that lately?
You have got a wonderful soul, Haley James Scott, and you're gonna make a beautiful bride in that dress.
Thank you.
Hi.
- Where'd you sleep?
- My car.
See, I had this horrible dream last night, that my best friend told me she had feelings for my boyfriend.
But that wasn't a dream, was it?
- Brooke...
- Why now, Peyton?
Why would you tell me you have feelings for Lucas, now?
When I have so much going on in my life, stuff that you don't even know about!
Well, so do I, okay?
Trust me.
But I didn't wish for this, all right?
I wished for Jake.
Oh, right.
You wished for Jake.
After you wished for Pete, and then Lucas.
I cannot believe this is happening again.
It's not, okay?
It's not, it's just...
Okay, the last time...
The last time?
Do you hear yourself right now?
The last time you tried to steal my boyfriend?
He's on the door, Peyton.
He's on the damn door under me!
- I don't wanna steal him, okay?
- But you like him.
Brooke, I'm not gonna do anything about it, okay?
- I'll just bury it!
- You can't.
Okay?
It's out.
It's like the time capsule.
And you could've buried it and not said anything to me.
- So what is that about?
- I don't know, all right?
I just...
I wanted to be honest with you.
All right?
I don't wanna make the same mistake I did last time.
And you know what?
You even said last night at Tric, that you really didn't miss him!
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare twist my words around to make yourself feel like you are not a backstabbing, two-faced bitch, Peyton, because you are,
- Hey, pretty girl.
- Hey.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Come on.
Nobody loves a wedding more than Brooke Davis.
What's up?
I'd just appreciate it if you wouldn't talk to Peyton today.
You're kidding, right?
This is a wedding.
We're all in the same wedding party.
We're all friends here, Brooke.
You know, could you do me a favor, just once, and put me above your precious Peyton, and do something that I ask you to do?
- Thanks.
- Whoa.
What happened?
And I'm stressed out about my speech, and Haley's dress, and I'm late.
I'm late to get ready, and I'm sorry.
Come here.
It's okay.
You look nice.
Weddings.
Rachel.
- You look almost as hot as me.
- Listen to me,
you gotta stop calling me.
I told you we couldn't see each other anymore.
And before you left that morning, I think I made myself perfectly clear.
Yeah, but the night before that, you weren't so clear.
In fact, if I remember right, I think you weren't so clear three times.
- You're 17.
- Yeah.
And I was 17 that night, too.
And all the other nights.
Okay, listen to me.
I'm sorry.
Okay?
I made a mistake.
But this is Nathan and Haley's day.
Now, I promise you we'll talk about this later, but do not make this ugly for them.
I wouldn't think of it.
Need a hand?
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.
It's just a tie, Lucas.
Come on, let me see.
So, how's life without basketball?
It's better than life without Keith.
Okay, let's see.
Dan thinks it was Keith.
The fire.
I just found out this morning.
I'm sorry, Karen.
It's not fair to Keith's memory.
It's not fair to you.
Yes, it's not fair to Keith.
But Dan's need for revenge was buried with his brother.
He's not gonna be coming after you, or anybody else.
Maybe so, but in a way, that makes me feel weaker than ever.
Nathan!
- Nathan.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Have you checked on Haley?
- Yeah.
She's fine.
'Cause she should be here by now.
Can you call her?
- Nate...
- Please!
- Just do it.
- Okay.
All right.
All right.
Hey.
Haley, you all right?
- Something's wrong, man.
- Hey.
What's up?
Hey, it's me.
Is everything okay?
Fine, soon-to-be-husband-again.
Why?
I just...
I just wanted to hear your voice, that's all.
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Oh, I'm sorry, princess.
I was looking for my friend Haley.
Wow, did it really take all this stuff to make you look like this?
No!
Everybody got ready in here,
including Rachel and Brooke, for some reason.
- Hi.
- All right.
- Wow.
You really look beautiful.
- Thank you.
So your parents really aren't coming?
No, they...
I invited them, and they said,
"Sorry, honey, we've been to your wedding once before,
"and it was a little boring."
Anyway, I'll just give myself away, that's fine.
Or I could do it.
If you'll have me.
- Really?
Luke, that would be perfect.
- Okay.
Thank you.
But you know what, I gotta be honest with you.
I could never officially give you away, you know that?
I could never give away my best friend.
Congrats.
Hey, Rachel.
You look almost as hot as me.
Sounds like something I would say.
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hi.
How about we go find you a good seat, friend?
Hey, you.
So, I've been informed to avoid you like the plague.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Just...
Look, if Brooke doesn't want you to talk to me, just do it.
I'll be fine.
Hey, Peyton.
You look nice.
- Feeling sentimental, Deb?
- Feeling nauseous, actually.
You had your chance.
Wanna make it a dual ceremony, Coop?
Now I know how this dress looks on a witch.
Go Brooke yourself.
Friends and loved ones,
we are gathered here today to witness the renewal of a commitment, a commitment between Nathan and Haley,
to love one another unconditionally and endlessly.
Nathan and Haley, there are many things I could say to the two of you today, but instead I choose to listen to the words you have for each other.
Haley?
Nathan, it's been said that there's one word that will free us from the weight and the pain of life, and that word is love.
And I believe that.
That doesn't mean that it hasn't been hard, or that it won't be, it just means that I've found a stillness and bravery in myself, with you.
You make me brave.
And I will love you until the end of time.
This I vow today.
Nathan?
Last year we stood on a beach, and I told you how much I loved you and how I would always, always protect you.
That day, nobody believed that this would work.
But I don't think anybody understood the love that I had for you, because if they did, they would have never doubted us.
So, I wanted to marry you all over again, in front of most of our world, because today, when I look into your eyes,
my love for you only grows.
It's even stronger now.
And our love will never waver.
This I vow to you, today, and always, and forever.
Haley, on this day, do you reconfirm and rededicate yourself to the vows you promised to uphold?
Oh.
Thank you.
I do.
Nathan, on this day,
do you rededicate and reconfirm your commitment
- to the vows you promised to uphold?
- I do.
And, actually, I have a new ring.
Thank you.
And now, before the eyes of God,
I once again pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss your bride.
- I love you, Haley.
- I love you, too.
You know, one day we'll walk down the aisle again, Deb.
- You'll see.
- Open your eyes, Dan.
I don't love you, I'm not coming back to you,
and Keith didn't try to kill you, I did.
Danny.
How's your life, little brother?
I'm Cooper, by the way.
You're Michelle Featherstone, right?
- Yes.
- That song you played was perfect.
- In fact, I think all your stuff's really great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I think all of your stuff is pretty great, too.
- Well, thank you.
Hey, Rach.
You gonna talk to me?
Please?
Fine.
So this is how it ends,
a 10-year friendship that survived two dead moms, three absentee parents, shoplifting, jail time,
- and we can't survive one boy?
- Not "one boy," Peyton, my boy.
And he still is your boy.
I told you that.
Do you love him?
You are something else.
How dare you be so selfish to ask me that about my boyfriend?
How dare I?
Okay, you know what, Brooke, I didn't want it this way.
Okay, I tried tears, all right?
I tried apologizing to you.
I cried.
And you know what you did?
You slapped me, and you blew me off.
Yeah, and you're gonna be lucky if next time I don't use my fist.
I can't believe you're supposed to be the maid of honor.
None of those words were, "Yes, Peyton.
I love him."
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand and join me in welcoming Nathan and Haley.
Husband and wife, again.
And now, the song they picked for their first dance.
What song did you pick, anyway?
- Oh, I was hoping it would be this one.
- I had a little help.
So are you gonna tell me what this is about?
- Maybe you should tell me about it.
- Well, what's that supposed to mean?
Peyton told me some things about the two of you.
Look, Brooke, I know
that you're worried about my past with Peyton, but you have to understand the circumstances this time, you know?
I mean, God, she was bleeding, and she thought she was gonna die.
I mean, the kiss, it meant nothing.
What kiss?
Did you kiss her again?
Look, Brooke, I need you to listen to me.
Okay, I understand that you didn't know about the kiss, and I'm sorry for springing it on you, but I meant what I said.
It didn't mean anything.
A kiss always means something.
Okay, well, maybe you're right, but it wasn't a romantic moment.
- And you would know that if...
- lf what, I was there?
As you so sweetly pointed out at the party, the party that I threw for you, I wasn't there, was I?
Is it impossible for you to forgive me?
- I forgave you.
- For what?
For sleeping with Chris Keller.
And you know what, Lucas?
I loved you for that.
You had such grace in that moment, that I fell in love with you all over again.
I can't believe that you would use it now as a bargaining chip.
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
I just...
I need you to trust me, and believe me when I tell you that my heart is with you.
But a part of me feels like ever since we got back together, you've just been waiting, waiting to push me away.
Oh, great.
You kiss Peyton again, and I'm pushing you away!
God, why did I make everybody identical purses as wedding gifts?
I love you, Brooke.
- I don't know how else to say it.
- How about how you show it?
I am not pushing you away, Lucas.
I am holding on for dear life, but I need you to need me back.
Okay, why wouldn't you tell me about the kiss?
And why didn't you call me while you were away?
And why won't you ever just let me all the way in?
We have to go and give our toasts now, about love.
Please don't be mad, Brooke.
I'm not mad, Lucas.
I'm not mad.
The last time I gave a speech about Nathan and Haley was, well, at their first reception.
And I remember saying, "Prepare to be surprised."
Well, I have to say, even I was surprised.
Because, you see, they do something that's very rare to see in someone our age.
Actually, it's very rare to see in anybody.
They give their hearts to each other, unconditionally.
And that's what true love really is.
It's not this fairy-tale life that never knows pain, but it's two souls facing it together,
and diminishing it with unconditional love.
To Nathan and Haley Scott.
I'm not the most eloquent speaker, so I thought I would borrow a few words from Shakespeare.
"Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds. "
When life gets hard, when things change,
true love remains the same.
I look at Nathan and Haley and somehow I feel safer.
I don't know if I can explain that,
but they give me hope.
And I'm afraid to say it out loud, because maybe if life finds out, it'll try to beat it out of them.
And that would be a shame, because we all can use a little hope sometimes, you know?
That feeling that everything is gonna be okay, and that there's gonna be someone there to help make sure of that.
So here's to Nathan and Haley.
Here's to hope.
And here's to a love that will not alter.
I never apologized for the way I treated you and Lucas, or for the way I treated Keith.
I suppose it's too late.
I'm pregnant.
I'm gonna be there for you this time, Karen.
It's gonna be okay.
Hi.
Excuse me, I'd like your attention for a second.
I'd like to propose a toast
to my knucklehead of a nephew and his beautiful bride.
Here we go.
As most of you know, Nathan and Haley's relationship was unexpected, mostly because Haley is classy and attractive, and Nathan is not.
But here's to Nathan and Haley, for proving to us that love is real, and genuine, and still attainable for the rest of us.
Cheers, you two.
Thanks, Coop, I guess.
Love you, man.
Well, well.
I would like to make a toast to Cooper's toast, about love.
But wait a minute.
What could Nathan and Haley possibly know about love?
I mean, they're only 17, right?
Right, Cooper?
You see, Cooper seems to think a 17-year-old couldn't possibly know anything about love.
Of course, you know, that didn't stop him from having sex with me, right?
Rachel.
Yeah.
To sex with Cooper!
- Is she serious?
- I'm so sorry.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
Hey, Rachel, come on!
Rachel!
No, no, no!
Hey, bad idea!
Hey!
Rachel, stop the car.
Damn it, Rachel, stop the car!
You trying to kill me?
What is your problem?
First, you ruin the reception, you steal the limousine, and you drive drunk!
- Are you out of your mind?
- I must be, to fall in love with you!
Look, I'm sorry, Rachel, okay?
I made a mistake when we slept together, and it wasn't just because you're 17.
Hell, even when I thought you were older, I wasn't looking to get serious.
I'm sorry, I mean, that sounds harsh, but you even said, "We're just having fun, Coop." Remember?
I lied.
I'm so stupid.
Hey, don't...
Don't do that.
- I thought you liked me.
- I did, Rachel.
I liked you.
Right.
"Liked."
Look, let me take you home.
Okay?
No.
I left all my stuff at the reception.
My purse, my keys...
That's fine.
That's great, you know what?
We'll take the limousine back to the reception,
and we'll pretend like none of this ever happened.
All right?
Let's go.
So, there was a slight mix-up.
- Sweet.
I'm driving.
- No way!
- Hey, we'll leave the car at the airport.
- All right.
We're going to London for a few days.
Why?
Doesn't it always rain there?
- Oh, yeah.
You in?
- Yeah.
Thank you, guys, for coming.
We love you!
Hey, buddy.
It looks like Rachel took the limo with Cooper.
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
I guess we never finished that conversation.
Dance with me.
- Didn't you miss me while you were away?
- Every day.
I was just angry
and upset about Keith, and I just needed to be alone, but that doesn't mean that I didn't miss you, Brooke,
because I did.
I needed to hear your voice.
There's just so much stuff going on with me.
What kind of stuff?
I just got that feeling, that stillness I used to feel before dawn,
that feeling that the world could be perfect.
Yeah, I feel it, too.
Don't say I never gave you anything.
Then there were two.
Sorry about today, and all the drama.
Peyton?
I accidentally told Brooke about the library,
the kiss.
- Luke?
- Hi.
Are you going home with Brooke, or with me?
With you.
Brooke left.
I'm sorry.
- You and Brooke okay?
- Yeah.
She's just going through some stuff.
Well, listen, could you grab my wrap and my purse?
Yeah, sure.
I'll drive.
Hey, Ma?
Are you pregnant?
Yes, I am.
That's not my purse.
Oh, you know, maybe Brooke took the wrong...
Brooke?
Brooke, don't go, please.
I don't want to, but I have to.
Okay, all right, look.
Just stop, all right?
What do I have to do to fix this?
Brooke, I'll do anything.
Just...
I don't want you to go.
You know, you asked me earlier today if I love Lucas, and I have your answer.
But you don't deserve to hear it.
- Brooke.
- No.
I want you to understand something.
As far as I'm concerned, this friendship is over.
And if we never speak again for the rest of our lives, that'll be fine.
I gave you a second chance, Peyton, and you blew it.
Is there anything I can say to keep you, Cooper?
No, sorry, Rachel, there's not.
That's too bad, because there's something I have to tell you.
Oh, I left my purse!
It's got everything in it, the plane tickets, everything.
We have to go back.
No, hold on, it's okay, I'll just have Lucas meet us.
Hey, Luke.
Hey, man, Haley left her purse and a bunch of stuff at the reception,
- could you bring that to us?
- It's in the anteroom.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
All right, well, we're coming up on the Molina Bridge right now, so, I guess we'll just pull over and wait for you.
All right.
Thanks, man.
Bye.
Done.
He already had the purse in his car.
- You're good in a crisis.
- I don't know about that.
No, you are.
Good thing, too, especially since I have something I have to tell you.
I don't believe you.
- Pull over.
- Hell, no.
I'm not letting you out until we talk about this.
- I said, pull over!
- No!
- We're gonna talk about this...
- I said, pull over!
I'm not pulling the car...
What are you doing?
Look out!
- That was Cooper.
Cooper!
- Cooper!
- Haley, call 911.
- Nathan, don't.
I love you.
Nathan!
Nathan!
Nathan, don't!
Nathan!
Cooper!
Anybody, please help!
William Shakespeare wrote...
Nathan!
"Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds..."
Help me!
"...it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests
"and is never shaken"
Oh, God, help me!
- Haley!
- Nathan!
Cooper!
"Love alters not with time's brief hours and weeks..."
Help!
Somebody, please help!
"...
But bears it out..."
Help me!
"...ev'n to the edge of doom."
English
At this moment, there are 6,502,867,120 people in the world.
Give or take a few.
And sometimes all you need is one... for better or for worse.
Help me!
Somebody, please help!
How long you been out here?
Couple hours.
Sometimes I come out here when I can't sleep.
You miss it?
Every day.
So, what's up?
Had this messed-up dream last night.
Haley was drowning, and I couldn't save her.
Of course, leave it to Haley to insist that we don't see each other until the wedding even though we're married.
Maybe I should just go see her.
I'll tell you what -
- I'll go check on her for you, how's that?
Tell her to stay away from the water, okay?
No swimming or anything.
Nathan... it's your wedding day -- again.
It's gonna be a great day.
Thanks, man.
You're closer than a hundred feet.
Just paying my respects.
You know, everyone thinks of Keith as this perfect guy, but they're wrong.
No, they're not, Dan.
Keith is a hero.
He tried to kill me.
That's right.
He's the one who tried to burn me in the dealership fire.
So I guess the hero got what was coming to him after all.
Knock, knock.
Hey, how is the bride-to-be... again?
Good.
Well, I'm afraid you've missed the boys.
They were gone pretty early.
Oh, that's okay.
I wanted to see you, actually.
I have a question for you.
Okay.
I know you and Keith were engaged, and it -- it breaks my heart.
I know.
I know.
Sorry.
Okay.
Um...
Brooke -
- Brooke made me this -- this dress, and it is out of the material that she ordered for your wedding dress.
And I just wanted to ask you if it was okay if I wore it.
And if it's not, that's fine.
She made another one that I can wear.
I am so proud of you, Haley.
Have I told you that lately?
You have got a wonderful soul, Haley James Scott.
And you are gonna make a beautiful bride in that dress.
Thank you.
Hi.
Where did you sleep?
My car.
See, I had this horrible dream last night that my best friend told me she had feelings for my boyfriend.
But that wasn't a dream, was it?
- Brooke --
- Why now, Peyton?
Why would you tell me you have feelings for Lucas now, when I have so much going on in my life, stuff that you don't even know about?
Well, so do I, okay?
Trust me.
But...
I didn't wish for this, all right?
I wished for Jake.
Oh, right.
You wished for Jake after you wished for Pete and then Lucas.
I cannot believe this is happening again.
It's not, okay?
It's not.
It's just... okay, the last time --
The last time?
Do you hear yourself right now?
"The last time" you tried to steal my boyfriend?
He's on the door, Peyton.
He's on the damn door under me!
I don't want to steal him, okay?
But you like him.
Brooke, I'm not gonna do anything about it, okay?
I'll just bury it.
You can't, okay?
It's out.
It's like the time capsule.
And you could've buried it and not said anything to me, so what is that about?
I don't know, all right?
!
I wanted to be honest with you, all right?
I didn't want to make the same mistake I did last time.
You even said last night at Tric that you really didn't miss him.
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare twist my words around to make yourself feel like you are not a backstabbing two-faced bitch, Peyton, because you are... and you know it.
Hey, pretty girl.
Hey.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Come on, nobody loves a wedding more than Brooke Davis.
What's up?
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't talk to Peyton today.
You're kidding, right?
This is a wedding.
We're all in the same wedding party.
We're all friends here, Brooke.
You know, could you do me a favor just once and put me above your precious Peyton and do something that I ask you to do?
Thanks.
Whoa.
What happened?
We had a fight... and I'm stressed out about my speech and Haley's dress, and I'm late.
I'm late to get ready, and...
I'm sorry.
Come here.
It's okay.
You look nice.
Weddings.
Rachel?
You look almost as hot as me.
Listen to me.
You got to stop calling me.
I told you we couldn't see each other anymore.
Before you left that morning, I think I made myself perfectly clear.
Yeah, but the night before that, you weren't so clear.
In fact, if I remember right, I think you weren't so clear three times.
You're 17.
Yeah.
I was 17 that night, too... and all the other nights.
Okay.
Listen to me.
I'm sorry, okay?
I made a mistake, but this is Nathan and Haley's day.
Now, I promise you we'll talk about this later, but do not make this ugly for them.
I wouldn't think of it.
Need a hand?
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.
It's just a tie, Lucas.
Come on, let me see.
So, how is life without basketball?
It's better than life without Keith.
Okay.
Let's see.
Dan thinks it was Keith -- the fire -- but I just found out this morning.
I'm sorry, Karen.
It's not fair to Keith's memory.
It's not fair to you.
Yes, it's not fair to Keith, but Dan's need for revenge was buried with his brother.
He's not gonna be coming after you or anybody else.
Maybe so, but in a way that makes me feel weaker than ever.
Nathan!
Nathan?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Have you checked on Haley?
- Yeah, she's fine.
She should be here by now.
Can you call her?
- Nate --
- Please.
Just do it.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Hey, Haley, you all right?
Something's wrong, man.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, it's me.
Is everything okay?
Fine, soon-to-be-husband-again, why?
I just...
I just wanted to hear your voice, that's all.
Where are you?
I'm right here.
Oh, I'm sorry, princess.
I was looking for my friend Haley.
Wow, did it really take all this stuff to make you look like this?
No, everybody got ready in here, including Rachel and Brooke for some reason.
Right.
Wow.
You... whew... really look beautiful.
Thank you.
So, your parents really aren't coming?
No, they -
- I invited them, and they said,
"sorry, honey, we've been to your wedding once before, and it was a little boring."
Anyway, I'll just give myself away.
It's fine.
Or I could do it if you'll have me.
Really?
Luke, that would be perfect.
Okay.
Thank you.
But you know what?
I got to be honest with you.
I could never officially give you away, you know that?
I could never give away my best friend.
Congrats.
Hey, Rachel.
You look almost as hot as me.
Sounds like something I would say.
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hi.
How about we, uh, go find you a good seat... friend?
Hey, you.
So, I've been informed to avoid you like the plague.
- What's up?
- Nothing, just -- look, if Brooke doesn't want you to talk to me, just do it.
I'll be fine.
Hey, Peyton.
You look nice.
Feeling sentimental, Deb?
Feeling nauseous, actually.
You had your chance.
Want to make it a dual ceremony, Coop?
Now I know how this dress looks on a witch.
Go Brooke yourself.
Friends and loved ones, we are gathered here today to witness the renewal of a commitment, a commitment between Nathan and Haley to love one another unconditionally and endlessly.
Nathan and Haley, there are many things I could say to the two of you today, but instead I choose to listen to the words you have for each other.
Haley?
Nathan, it's been said that there's one word that will free us from the weight and the pain of life, and that word is "love,"
and I believe that.
That doesn't mean that it hasn't been hard or that it won't be.
It just means that I found a stillness and a bravery in myself with you.
You make me brave, and I will love you until the end of time.
This I vow today.
Nathan?
Last year, we stood on a beach, and I told you how much I loved you and how I would always, always protect you.
That day nobody believed that this would work, but I don't think anybody understood the love that I had for you.
Because if they did, they would've never doubted us.
So I wanted to marry you all over again in front of most of our world because today, when I look into your eyes, my love for you only grows.
It's even stronger now, and our love will never waver.
And this I vow to you today and always and forever.
Haley, on this day, do you reconfirm and rededicate yourself to the vows you promised to uphold?
Oh.
Thank you.
I do.
Nathan, on this day, do you rededicate and reconfirm your commitment to the vows you promised to uphold?
I do.
And, uh, actually, I have a new ring.
Thank you.
And now, before the eyes of God,
I once again pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss your bride.
- I love you, Haley.
- I love you, too.
You know... one day we'll walk down the aisle again, Deb.
You'll see.
Open your eyes, Dan.
I don't love you.
I'm not coming back to you.
And Keith didn't try to kill you.
I did.
Danny?
How's your life, little brother?
I'm Cooper, by the way.
You're Michelle Featherstone, right?
Yes.
That song you played was perfect.
In fact, I think all your stuff is really great.
Thank you, thank you.
I think, um, all of your stuff is pretty great, too.
Well, thank you.
Hey, Rach.
Are you gonna talk to me?
Please?
Fine.
So, this is how it ends -- a 10-year friendship that survived two dead moms, three absentee parents, shoplifting, jail time,
and we can't survive one boy?
Not one boy, Peyton -- my boy.
And he still is your boy.
I told you that.
Do you love him?
You are something else.
How dare you be so selfish to ask me that about my boyfriend.
How dare I?
Okay, you know what, Brooke?
I didn't want it this way, okay?
I tried tears.
I tried apologizing to you.
I cried, and you know what you did?
You slapped me, and you blew me off.
You're gonna be lucky if next time I don't use my fist.
I can't believe you're supposed to be the maid of honor.
And by the way, none of those words were, "yes, Peyton, I love him."
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand and join me in welcoming Nathan and Haley, husband and wife again.
And now the song they picked for their first dance.
What song did you pick anyway?
Oh, I was hoping it would be this one.
I had a little help.
So you gonna tell me what this is about?
Maybe you should tell me about it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Peyton told me some things about the two of you.
Look, Brooke, I know that you're worried about my past with Peyton, but you have to understand the circumstances this time, you know?
God, she was bleeding, and she thought she was gonna die.
I mean, the kiss, it meant nothing.
What kiss?
Did you kiss her again?
Look, Brooke, I need you to listen to me, okay?
I understand that you didn't know about the kiss, and I'm sorry for springing it on you, but I meant what I said.
It didn't mean anything.
A kiss always means something.
Okay, maybe you're right, but it wasn't a romantic moment,
- and you would know that if --
- If what -
- I was there?
As you so sweetly pointed out at the party, the party that I threw for you,
I wasn't there, was I?
Is it impossible for you to forgive me?
I forgave you.
For what?
For sleeping with Chris Keller.
And you know what, Lucas?
I loved you for that.
You had such grace in that moment that I fell in love with you all over again.
I can't believe that you would use it now as a bargaining chip.
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
I just...
I need you to trust me and believe me when I tell you that my heart is with you.
But part of me feels like ever since we got back together, you've just been waiting -- waiting to push me away.
Oh, great.
You kiss Peyton -- again -- and I'm pushing you away!
God!
Why did I make everybody identical purses as wedding gifts?
!
I love you, Brooke.
I don't know how else to say it.
How about how you show it?
I am not pushing you away, Lucas.
I am holding on for dear life, but I need you to need me back.
Okay, why wouldn't you tell me about the kiss?
And why didn't you call me while you were away?
And why won't you ever just let me all the way in?

Hey, hey -- bad idea.
Hey, hey, hey!

Damn it, Rachel, stop the car!
Are you trying to kill me?
!
What is your problem?

I thought you liked me.

"Liked."
Look, let me take you home, okay?
No.
I left all my stuff at the reception -- my purse, my keys--

I needed to hear your voice.
There's just so much stuff going on with me.
What kind of stuff?

Peyton...
I accidentally told Brooke about the library, the kiss.
Um, Luke?
Are you going home with Brooke or with me?
Uh, with you.
Brooke left.
I'm sorry.
You and Brooke okay?
Yeah, she's just going through some stuff.
Well, could you grab my wrap and my purse?
Yeah, sure.
I'll drive.
Hey, ma, are you... pregnant?
Yes, I am.
But that's not my purse.
You know, maybe Brooke took the wrong --
Brooke.
Brooke, don't go -- please.
I don't want to, but I have to.
Okay.
All right.
Look, just stop, all right?
What do I have to do to fix this?
Brooke, I'll do anything.
Just -
- I don't want you to go.
You asked me earlier today if I love Lucas, and I have your answer.
But you don't deserve to hear it.
Brooke --
No.
I want you to understand something.
As far as I am concerned, this friendship is over.
And if we never speak again for the rest of our lives, that'll be fine.
I gave you a second chance, Peyton, and you blew it.
Is there anything I could say to keep you, Cooper?
No, I'm sorry, Rachel.
There's not.
That's too bad... because there's something I have to tell you.
Oh!
I left my purse.
It's got everything in it -- the plane tickets, everything.
We have to go back.
No, no, no, it's okay.
I'll just have Lucas meet us.
Hey, Luke?
Hey, man, Haley left her purse and a bunch of stuff at the reception.
Could you bring that to us?
Oh.
Oh, okay.
Well, we're coming up on the Molina Bridge right now, so I guess we'll just pull over and wait for you.
All right.
Thanks, man.
Bye.
Done.
He already had the purse in his car.
You're good in a crisis.
Oh, I don't know about that.
No, you are.
It's a good thing, too, especially since I have something I have to tell you.
I don't believe you.
Pull over.
Hell no.
I'm not letting you out until we talk about this.
- I said pull over!
- No!
I said pull over!
What are you doing?
!
Look out!
That was Cooper.
Cooper!
Cooper!
- Haley, call 911.
- Nathan, don't!
I love you.
Nathan!
Nathan!
Nathan!
Nathan!
Cooper!
Anybody, please help!
William shakespeare wrote,
"Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.
It is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken."
Oh, god!
Help me!
Haley!
Nathan!
Cooper!
"Love alters not with time's brief hours and weeks..."
Somebody, please help!
"...but bears it out..."
Help me!
"...even to the edge of doom."
At this moment, there are six billion, 502 million,
867, 120 people in the world,
give or take a few.
And sometimes, all you need is one.
For better, or for worse.
Help me!
- How long you been out here?
- A couple hours.
Sometimes, I come out here when I can't sleep.
- You miss it?
- Every day.
- So what's up?
- I had this messed up dream last night.
Haley was drowning, and I couldn't save her.
Of course, leave it to Haley to insist that we don't see each other until the wedding, even though we're married.
Maybe I should just go see her.
I'll tell you what, I'll go check on her for you, how's that?
Well, tell her to stay away from the water, okay?
No swimming or anything.
Nathan, it's your wedding day.
Again.
- It's gonna be a great day.
- Thanks.
You're closer than 100 feet.
Just paying my respects.
You know, everyone thinks of Keith as this perfect guy,
- but they're wrong.
- No, they're not, Dan.
Keith is a hero.
He tried to kill me.
That's right.
He's the one who tried to burn me in the dealership fire.
So I guess the hero got what was coming to him, after all.
Knock, knock!
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.
- How is the bride-to-be?
- Oh, good.
Good.
Well, I'm afraid you've missed the boys.
They were gone pretty early.
Oh, that's okay.
I wanted to see you, actually.
- I have a question for you.
- Okay.
I know you and Keith were engaged, and it breaks my heart.
- I know, I know.
- Sorry.
Okay, Brooke made me this dress, and it is out of the material that she ordered for your wedding dress, and I just wanted to ask you if it was okay if I wore it.
And if it's not, that's fine, she made another one that I can wear...
I'm so proud of you, Haley.
Have I told you that lately?
You have got a wonderful soul, Haley James Scott, and you're gonna make a beautiful bride in that dress.
Thank you.
Hi.
- Where'd you sleep?
- My car.
See, I had this horrible dream last night, that my best friend told me she had feelings for my boyfriend.
But that wasn't a dream, was it?
- Brooke...
- Why now, Peyton?
Why would you tell me you have feelings for Lucas, now?
When I have so much going on in my life, stuff that you don't even know about!
Well, so do I, okay?
Trust me.
But I didn't wish for this, all right?
I wished for Jake.
Oh, right.
You wished for Jake.
After you wished for Pete, and then Lucas.
I cannot believe this is happening again.
It's not, okay?
It's not, it's just...
Okay, the last time...
The last time?
Do you hear yourself right now?
The last time you tried to steal my boyfriend?
He's on the door, Peyton.
He's on the damn door under me!
- I don't wanna steal him, okay?
- But you like him.
Brooke, I'm not gonna do anything about it, okay?
- I'll just bury it!
- You can't.
Okay?
It's out.
It's like the time capsule.
And you could've buried it and not said anything to me.
- So what is that about?
- I don't know, all right?
I just...
I wanted to be honest with you.
All right?
I don't wanna make the same mistake I did last time.
And you know what?
You even said last night at Tric, that you really didn't miss him!
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare twist my words around to make yourself feel like you are not a backstabbing, two-faced bitch, Peyton, because you are, and you know it.
- Hey, pretty girl.
- Hey.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Come on.
Nobody loves a wedding more than Brooke Davis.
What's up?
I'd just appreciate it if you wouldn't talk to Peyton today.
You're kidding, right?
This is a wedding.
We're all in the same wedding party.
We're all friends here, Brooke.
You know, could you do me a favor, just once, and put me above your precious Peyton, and do something that I ask you to do?
- Thanks.
- Whoa.
What happened?
We had a fight.
And I'm stressed out about my speech, and Haley's dress, and I'm late.
I'm late to get ready, and I'm sorry.
Come here.
It's okay.
You look nice.
Weddings.
Rachel.
- You look almost as hot as me.
- Listen to me, you gotta stop calling me.
I told you we couldn't see each other anymore.
And before you left that morning, I think I made myself perfectly clear.
Yeah, but the night before that, you weren't so clear.
In fact, if I remember right, I think you weren't so clear three times.
- You're 17.
- Yeah.
And I was 17 that night, too.
And all the other nights.
Okay, listen to me.
I'm sorry.
Okay?
I made a mistake.
But this is Nathan and Haley's day.
Now, I promise you we'll talk about this later, but do not make this ugly for them.
I wouldn't think of it.
Need a hand?
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.
It's just a tie, Lucas.
Come on, let me see.
So, how's life without basketball?
It's better than life without Keith.
Okay, let's see.
Dan thinks it was Keith.
The fire.
I just found out this morning.
I'm sorry, Karen.
It's not fair to Keith's memory.
It's not fair to you.
Yes, it's not fair to Keith.
But Dan's need for revenge was buried with his brother.
He's not gonna be coming after you, or anybody else.
Maybe so, but in a way, that makes me feel weaker than ever.
Nathan!
- Nathan.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Have you checked on Haley?
- Yeah.
She's fine.
'Cause she should be here by now.
Can you call her?
- Nate...
- Please!
- Just do it.
- Okay.
All right.
All right.
Hey.
Haley, you all right?
- Something's wrong, man.
- Hey.
What's up?
Hey, it's me.
Is everything okay?
Fine, soon-to-be-husband-again.
Why?
I just...
I just wanted to hear your voice, that's all.
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Oh, I'm sorry, princess.
I was looking for my friend Haley.
Wow, did it really take all this stuff to make you look like this?
No!
Everybody got ready in here, including Rachel and Brooke, for some reason.
- Hi.
- All right.
- Wow.
You really look beautiful.
- Thank you.
So your parents really aren't coming?
No, they...
I invited them, and they said,
"Sorry, honey, we've been to your wedding once before,
"and it was a little boring."
Anyway, I'll just give myself away, that's fine.
Or I could do it.
If you'll have me.
- Really?
Luke, that would be perfect.
- Okay.
Thank you.
But you know what, I gotta be honest with you.
I could never officially give you away, you know that?
I could never give away my best friend.
Congrats.
Hey, Rachel.
You look almost as hot as me.
Sounds like something I would say.
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hi.
How about we go find you a good seat, friend?
Hey, you.
So, I've been informed to avoid you like the plague.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Just...
Look, if Brooke doesn't want you to talk to me, just do it.
I'll be fine.
Hey, Peyton.
You look nice.
- Feeling sentimental, Deb?
- Feeling nauseous, actually.
You had your chance.
Wanna make it a dual ceremony, Coop?
Now I know how this dress looks on a witch.
Go Brooke yourself.
Friends and loved ones, we are gathered here today to witness the renewal of a commitment, a commitment between Nathan and Haley, to love one another unconditionally and endlessly.
Nathan and Haley, there are many things I could say to the two of you today, but instead I choose to listen to the words you have for each other.
Haley?
Nathan, it's been said that there's one word that will free us from the weight and the pain of life, and that word is love.
And I believe that.
That doesn't mean that it hasn't been hard, or that it won't be, it just means that I've found a stillness and bravery in myself, with you.
You make me brave.
And I will love you until the end of time.
This I vow today.
Nathan?
Last year we stood on a beach, and I told you how much I loved you and how I would always, always protect you.
That day, nobody believed that this would work.
But I don't think anybody understood the love that I had for you, because if they did, they would have never doubted us.
So, I wanted to marry you all over again, in front of most of our world, because today, when I look into your eyes,
my love for you only grows.
It's even stronger now.
And our love will never waver.
This I vow to you, today, and always, and forever.
Haley, on this day, do you reconfirm and rededicate yourself to the vows you promised to uphold?
Oh.
Thank you.
I do.
Nathan, on this day, do you rededicate and reconfirm your commitment
- to the vows you promised to uphold?
- I do.
And, actually, I have a new ring.
Thank you.
And now, before the eyes of God,
I once again pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss your bride.
- I love you, Haley.
- I love you, too.
You know, one day we'll walk down the aisle again, Deb.
- You'll see.
- Open your eyes, Dan.
I don't love you, I'm not coming back to you, and Keith didn't try to kill you, I did.
Danny.
How's your life, little brother?
I'm Cooper, by the way.
You're Michelle Featherstone, right?
- Yes.
- That song you played was perfect.
- In fact, I think all your stuff's really great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I think all of your stuff is pretty great, too.
- Well, thank you.
Hey, Rach.
You gonna talk to me?
Please?
Fine.
So this is how it ends, a 10-year friendship that survived two dead moms, three absentee parents, shoplifting, jail time,
- and we can't survive one boy?
- Not "one boy," Peyton, my boy.
And he still is your boy.
I told you that.
Do you love him?
You are something else.
How dare you be so selfish to ask me that about my boyfriend?
How dare I?
Okay, you know what, Brooke, I didn't want it this way.
Okay, I tried tears, all right?
I tried apologizing to you.
I cried.
And you know what you did?
You slapped me, and you blew me off.
Yeah, and you're gonna be lucky if next time I don't use my fist.
I can't believe you're supposed to be the maid of honor.
And by the way, none of those words were, "Yes, Peyton.
I love him."
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand and join me in welcoming Nathan and Haley.
Husband and wife, again.
And now, the song they picked for their first dance.
What song did you pick, anyway?
- Oh, I was hoping it would be this one.
- I had a little help.
So are you gonna tell me what this is about?
- Maybe you should tell me about it.
- Well, what's that supposed to mean?
Peyton told me some things about the two of you.
Look, Brooke, I know that you're worried about my past with Peyton, but you have to understand the circumstances this time, you know?
I mean, God, she was bleeding, and she thought she was gonna die.
I mean, the kiss, it meant nothing.
What kiss?
Did you kiss her again?
Look, Brooke, I need you to listen to me.
Okay, I understand that you didn't know about the kiss, and I'm sorry for springing it on you, but I meant what I said.
It didn't mean anything.
A kiss always means something.
Okay, well, maybe you're right, but it wasn't a romantic moment.
- And you would know that if...
- lf what, I was there?
As you so sweetly pointed out at the party, the party that I threw for you, I wasn't there, was I?
Is it impossible for you to forgive me?
- I forgave you.
- For what?
For sleeping with Chris Keller.
And you know what, Lucas?
I loved you for that.
You had such grace in that moment, that I fell in love with you all over again.
I can't believe that you would use it now as a bargaining chip.
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
I just...
I need you to trust me, and believe me when I tell you that my heart is with you.
But a part of me feels like ever since we got back together, you've just been waiting, waiting to push me away.
Oh, great.
You kiss Peyton again, and I'm pushing you away!
God, why did I make everybody identical purses as wedding gifts?
I love you, Brooke.
- I don't know how else to say it.
- How about how you show it?
I am not pushing you away, Lucas.
I am holding on for dear life, but I need you to need me back.
Okay, why wouldn't you tell me about the kiss?
And why didn't you call me while you were away?
And why won't you ever just let me all the way in?
We have to go and give our toasts now, about love.
Please don't be mad, Brooke.
I'm not mad, Lucas.
I'm not mad.
The last time I gave a speech about Nathan and Haley was, well, at their first reception.
And I remember saying, "Prepare to be surprised."
Well, I have to say, even I was surprised.
Because, you see, they do something that's very rare to see in someone our age.
Actually, it's very rare to see in anybody.
They give their hearts to each other, unconditionally.
And that's what true love really is.
It's not this fairy-tale life that never knows pain, but it's two souls facing it together,
and diminishing it with unconditional love.
To Nathan and Haley Scott.
I'm not the most eloquent speaker, so I thought I would borrow a few words from Shakespeare.
"Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds. "
When life gets hard, when things change, true love remains the same.
I look at Nathan and Haley and somehow I feel safer.
I don't know if I can explain that, but they give me hope.
And I'm afraid to say it out loud, because maybe if life finds out, it'll try to beat it out of them.
And that would be a shame, because we all can use a little hope sometimes, you know?
That feeling that everything is gonna be okay, and that there's gonna be someone there to help make sure of that.
So here's to Nathan and Haley.
Here's to hope.
And here's to a love that will not alter.
I never apologized for the way I treated you and Lucas, or for the way I treated Keith.
I suppose it's too late.
I'm pregnant.
I'm gonna be there for you this time, Karen.
It's gonna be okay.
Hi.
Excuse me, I'd like your attention for a second.
I'd like to propose a toast to my knucklehead of a nephew and his beautiful bride.
Here we go.
As most of you know, Nathan and Haley's relationship was unexpected, mostly because Haley is classy and attractive, and Nathan is not.
But here's to Nathan and Haley, for proving to us that love is real, and genuine, and still attainable for the rest of us.
Cheers, you two.
Thanks, Coop, I guess.
Love you, man.
Well, well.
I would like to make a toast to Cooper's toast, about love.
But wait a minute.
What could Nathan and Haley possibly know about love?
I mean, they're only 17, right?
Right, Cooper?
You see, Cooper seems to think a 17-year-old couldn't possibly know anything about love.
Of course, you know, that didn't stop him from having sex with me, right?
Rachel.
Yeah.
To sex with Cooper!
- Is she serious?
- I'm so sorry.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
Hey, Rachel, come on!
Rachel!
No, no, no!
Hey, bad idea!
Hey!
Rachel, stop the car.
Damn it, Rachel, stop the car!
You trying to kill me?
What is your problem?
First, you ruin the reception, you steal the limousine, and you drive drunk!
- Are you out of your mind?
- I must be, to fall in love with you!
Look, I'm sorry, Rachel, okay?
I made a mistake when we slept together, and it wasn't just because you're 17.
Hell, even when I thought you were older, I wasn't looking to get serious.
I'm sorry, I mean, that sounds harsh, but you even said, "We're just having fun, Coop." Remember?
I lied.
I'm so stupid.
Hey, don't...
Don't do that.
- I thought you liked me.
- I did, Rachel.
I liked you.
Right.
"Liked."
Look, let me take you home.
Okay?
No.
I left all my stuff at the reception.
My purse, my keys...
That's fine.
That's great, you know what?
We'll take the limousine back to the reception, and we'll pretend like none of this ever happened.
All right?
Let's go.
So, there was a slight mix-up.
- Sweet.
I'm driving.
- No way!
- Hey, we'll leave the car at the airport.
- All right.
We're going to London for a few days.
Why?
Doesn't it always rain there?
- Oh, yeah.
You in?
- Yeah.
Thank you, guys, for coming.
We love you!
Hey, buddy.
It looks like Rachel took the limo with Cooper.
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
I guess we never finished that conversation.
Dance with me.
- Didn't you miss me while you were away?
- Every day.
I was just angry and upset about Keith, and I just needed to be alone, but that doesn't mean that I didn't miss you, Brooke,
because I did.
I needed to hear your voice.
There's just so much stuff going on with me.
What kind of stuff?
I just got that feeling, that stillness I used to feel before dawn,
that feeling that the world could be perfect.
Yeah, I feel it, too.
Don't say I never gave you anything.
Then there were two.
Sorry about today, and all the drama.
Peyton?
I accidentally told Brooke about the library, the kiss.
- Luke?
- Hi.
Are you going home with Brooke, or with me?
With you.
Brooke left.
I'm sorry.
- You and Brooke okay?
- Yeah.
She's just going through some stuff.
Well, listen, could you grab my wrap and my purse?
Yeah, sure.
I'll drive.
Hey, Ma?
Are you pregnant?
Yes, I am.
That's not my purse.
Oh, you know, maybe Brooke took the wrong...
Brooke?
Brooke, don't go, please.
I don't want to, but I have to.
Okay, all right, look.
Just stop, all right?
What do I have to do to fix this?
Brooke, I'll do anything.
Just...
I don't want you to go.
You know, you asked me earlier today if I love Lucas, and I have your answer.
But you don't deserve to hear it.
- Brooke.
- No.
I want you to understand something.
As far as I'm concerned, this friendship is over.
And if we never speak again for the rest of our lives, that'll be fine.
I gave you a second chance, Peyton, and you blew it.
Is there anything I can say to keep you, Cooper?
No, sorry, Rachel, there's not.
That's too bad, because there's something I have to tell you.
Oh, I left my purse!
It's got everything in it, the plane tickets, everything.
We have to go back.
No, hold on, it's okay, I'll just have Lucas meet us.
Hey, Luke.
Hey, man, Haley left her purse and a bunch of stuff at the reception,
- could you bring that to us?
- It's in the anteroom.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
All right, well, we're coming up on the Molina Bridge right now, so, I guess we'll just pull over and wait for you.
All right.
Thanks, man.
Bye.
Done.
He already had the purse in his car.
- You're good in a crisis.
- I don't know about that.
No, you are.
Good thing, too, especially since I have something I have to tell you.
I don't believe you.
- Pull over.
- Hell, no.
I'm not letting you out until we talk about this.
- I said, pull over!
- No!
- We're gonna talk about this...
- I said, pull over!
I'm not pulling the car...
What are you doing?
Look out!
- That was Cooper.
Cooper!
- Cooper!
- Haley, call 911.
- Nathan, don't.
I love you.
Nathan!
Nathan!
Nathan, don't!
Nathan!
Cooper!
Anybody, please help!
William Shakespeare wrote...
Nathan!
"Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds..."
Help me!
"...it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests
"and is never shaken"
Oh, God, help me!
- Haley!
- Nathan!
Cooper!
"Love alters not with time's brief hours and weeks..."
Help!
Somebody, please help!
"...
But bears it out..."
Help me!
"...ev'n to the edge of doom."
English
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...
I have a heart condition, and if I play, I could die.
You're lucky all I did was send him away.
Daddy, that was Pete from Fall Out Boy.
Marry me again in front of all our friends and our family.
When are you gonna get over Jabba the slut so we can go back to being friends?
What are you doing to Rachel, Brooke?
The picture -
- Rachel said it was someone she knew.
It's you.
This used to be you.
Just please be careful.
What if we don't have sex until we get married again?
Are you kidding?
Uncle Cooper, what are you doing here, man?
I met this smoking-hot girl.
She's 26.
She's a model -- you know, my type.
Mouth.
- I just thought maybe --
- Oh, you got flowers.
Who are they from?
Just promise me one thing -- when you pick the boy that you're really gonna be with that he'll be someone who respects you.
Use your head and follow your heart.
Stepping up -- it's a simple concept.
It basically means to rise above yourself, to do a little more... to show you something special... something like this.
Lucas is gone, but that doesn't mean the season is over.
As a matter of fact, I'd say it's just beginning.
You might want to stay out of my way for a while.
Another ferocious dunk by Nathan Scott, and this crowd is on their feet.
Sure you don't want to sleep with me till the ceremony?
I know I look pretty sexy right now.
Life's funny sometimes, can push pretty hard, like when you fall in love with someone, but they forget to love you back, like when your best friend and your boyfriend leave you alone, like when you pull the trigger or light the flame, and you can't take it back.
Like I said, in sports, they call this "stepping up."
In life, I call it pushing back.
Hey.
Hey.
Jenny didn't wake you up, did she?
No.
I mean, not -- not really.
So what happened to you last night?
Jenny was a little fussy, so we slept on the couch.
I didn't get a chance to thank you before I crashed for getting in touch with me after the whole shooting thing.
It's a pretty good deal, right?
You know, take a bullet, get a call from Jake.
I really wish I could have been there for you, Peyton.
I know.
So, listen -- this is all kind of last-minute, but I actually sort of had plans today.
Oh.
Yeah, of course you do.
I'm sorry, I --
No, it's just that Jenny and I, we usually spend saturday mornings in the park, so I thought maybe you'd like to come.
That sounds perfect.
Excuse me.
You're Haley, right?
Yeah.
You look good in blue.
It suits you.
Thanks.
You know what else would look good on you?
Me.
I'm Damien West.
I think you're out of your league.
Nathan Scott.
You two know each other?
High Flyers.
You still missing your free throws, West?
Who cares?
They don't show free throws on "sportscenter."
You know what else they don't show?
Ravens.
Hey, I heard you guys lost your shooter, so I guess your season's over, huh?
No, I don't think so.
Well, unless you win this tournament, you're not making postseason, and you're not gonna win this tournament because we are, and we're undefeated.
For now.
Let's go, Hales.
See ya on the court, Scott.
And, Haley, I'll see you in your dreams.
Peyton Sawyer.
It's so crazy that you're here.
I think when my dad told me to follow my heart, he didn't anticipate me following it all the way down to Savannah for the weekend.
How's your life, Jake?
Twice a week it's awesome.
Those are the days I get Jenny.
What?
Yeah, it's a long story.
Basically -- hey, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Basically, when Nicki left Tree Hill, she took Jenny here to Savannah to be with her parents.
But her parents finally had enough of both of us, so they petitioned the court for custody of Jenny for a year, just long enough for me and Nicki to prove that we can keep our lives together, you know?
Like keep a job, stay out of trouble.
Want to go on the slide?
So, wait -
- Nicki's here?
Come here, baby.
Yeah, she stays with her folks.
She gets Jenny most of the time.
It took me a while to be okay with that, but I actually think she's really trying.
Anyways, basically I can't do anything -- no drinking.
They drug test me -
- I mean, not that that even matters, but, like, I can't get a parking ticket.
I just sleep, work, hope that in a few months I'll get custody of Jenny.
Then I can start my life again, you know?
What are you doing here, Dan?
Just dealing with the past.
I heard you were home.
I wanted to see you.
You look good.
You look terrible.
Well, I haven't been sleeping very well.
Truth is, I've been struggling quite a bit ever since Keith, um...
I'm trying here, Deb, okay?
I just thought now that you're back and Nathan's moved out, maybe you're lonely in such a big house.
She's not.
Well, well, it's the racecar-crashing brother.
You staying at my house now, Cooper?
Actually, I'm staying at my sister's house.
And because it is my sister's house, I don't think we'll be seeing much of you around here, unless, of course, you're invited.
You have a problem with me, kid?
No, but you definitely have a problem with me.
What the hell is this?
Dad, just go home.
I could say the same thing to you, Nathan.
I heard you moved back in with Hades --
I meant "Haley."
Dad, I'm serious.
Let's go.
Don't be a stranger, Cooper.
Dad, come on.
Welcome home.
Oh, the kid's finally playing well.
Try not to almost kill him while you're back.
Just go, dad.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Dad, what the hell is wrong with you?
Don't you think maybe mom's had enough?
It's my house, Nathan.
No, it's not.
It's not your house, and she's not your wife.
Now, damn it, dad, you've got to stop this crap.
Or what?
!
I'm the freakin' mayor of this town, Nathan.
I can go wherever the hell I want and do whatever the hell I please.
Do you hear me?
!
Yeah, I hear you.
So do the neighbors, Mr. Mayor.
This is my house.
I worked hard to build it, and if I want, I'll burn the damn thing down and everything in it.
He's getting worse, mom.
He's never gonna change, my dad.
I can totally see him resorting to the same manipulative crap.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could just take you away from all that.
Ever hear from Lucas and Karen?
No.
Lucas said they were just gonna get on the road and drive.
I think they probably just need a break at this point.
Plus, Karen doesn't really want him around the tournament when he can't play, you know?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Does that ever hurt?
No.
The scar stopped hurting when my heart stopped hurting, right around the time you came home.
Okay.
Where'd you go?
Oh, I get it.
This is the no-sex thing, right?
I totally got you, didn't I?
No.
I told you I was sexy, Haley.
Don't lie.
Okay, maybe.
You know, that's really not fair.
I mean, it's one thing to break my heart, but do you have to look like a beer commercial while you're doing it?
I've been calling you.
Yeah, I just figured you were busy with old man river.
He's not that much older than us.
Come on, Rachel.
I'm not an idiot.
Or actually maybe I am, thinking you were into me.
I mean, let's see -- we spent a ton of time together.
We flirted, kissed a few times.
Mouth, I didn't mean to lead you on.
It happened anyway, didn't it?
I mean, I said I wasn't gonna fall for you, but I kissed you, and I woke up wanting to do it again.
And now here we are.
Stop!
Oh, I thought witches were supposed to melt.
What the hell is wrong with you?
What the hell is wrong with me?
I'm not the freak with the plastic ass and the tin heart.
You're the freak with the fat ass and no heart!
You know what, girl formerly know as orca?
You led Mouth on and you know it, so maybe it's time you get back in touch with your inner sperm whale and realize you now have fewer friends than you did before.
Really?
Well, my new friend Lucas just called me.
Call you lately?
Didn't think so.
You know, Rachel, I would punch you in your fake nose right now, but you'd just go out and buy another one.
E nough.
Just...
Never mind.
I am gonna make you regret this.
So, that building right there -- that's the courthouse.
That's where the judge scared the crap out of me and Nicki.
Oh, and that alleyway right there?
That's where I threw up...
Before and after the hearing.
- Good work.
- Yeah.
And that building on the corner there -- that's the Savannah College of Art and Design.
Didn't throw up there.
I hope not.
That place is awesome.
That's what I hear.
And then every other building in Savannah is either haunted by some crazy ghost or witch or gremlin or something.
I don't know.
Any by a sarcastic goth angel?
What?
Nothing.
We all have our ghosts, right?
Yeah.
So, anyway, this drink is like nectar from heaven.
You need to try it.
Okay.
Jake!
Come here.
You're a mess.
I know.
I got it.
Do you want to get some food with that drink?
Yeah.
There's a place right around the corner actually that's pretty good.
I can't believe you squirted Rachel in the face with her own hose.
She's just lucky the golf ball didn't hit her.
She probably sucked it out first.
Mouth!
Nathan's hot uncle Cooper's in town.
Oh, my god.
How do I look?
Like Lucas' girlfriend.
Wait a minute.
Is that him?
Nice, huh?
I'd love me some uncle Cooper.
Yeah, well, you're gonna hate this.
Uncle Cooper is Rachel's new boyfriend.
What?
No!
No, that is not fair!
Okay, can I just reiterate my whole broken-heart scenario?
But if I had known that he would date a girl in high school, I mean, I would have --
He wouldn't.
Mouth, I know Cooper.
There is no way he would date a high-school girl.
But I'm sure that was him.
I'm not saying it wasn't him.
I'm saying he doesn't know how old Rachel is... yet.
I think it's time Franken-Rachel felt a little of the heartache you're feeling.
Hey, Jake, can I ask you a question?
Um, look, I know Nicki's around now, and so I was just wondering, are you guys --
No.
No.
But one of the hardest things for me to accept was that Nicki and I are always gonna have Jenny in common and that Jenny should know who her mother is.
I mean, you can understand that, right?
- Yeah.
- But no, no.
Not together.
How about you?
You seeing anybody?
Me?
I mean -- not really.
I was kind of dating Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy.
Yeah.
Well, I've been dating Shakira most nights, but she doesn't really know about it.
I'm serious, actually.
It sounds weird, but it just kind of happened, so...
That sucks.
I mean, not that you dated a guy.
It's just that... you dated a rock star.
Musicians -- they're trouble, you know?
Well, we'd love to start playing for y'all, whenever our lead singer decides to stop flirting with those pretty girls.
Come on, man.
Second job.
I'm telling you -- you got to watch out for those musicians.
How you doing tonight?
So, I wrote this song for somebody special.
It's called "Someday."
# It's the biggest storm in years, they say #
# Couldn't take a plane so I hopped a train #
# 'Cause I like to stay in a stormy winter day #
# So I'll come back to you someday #
# As the days flow by it's all so clear #
# I've been everywhere but never right here #
# It's always the same #
# Coffee and change #
# But I'll come back to you someday #
# I'll travel all night just to see your face #
# The way you touch, the way you taste #
# Even if only for a day #
# 'Cause I'll come back to you someday #
# So close, so far #
# Some other world #
# It's spinning me away, yeah, yeah, yeah #
# I'll say so close, so far #
# Some other world #
# Spinning me away #
# Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... #
# It's spinning me away #
Mmm, you're late.
But I look hot enough to get away with it, right?
Maybe.
Nice house.
Well, thank you, but it's my sister's.
You want the tour?
Mmm... mostly I'm just interested in the bedroom.
Oh, that's so not fair.
It's upstairs.
Did you know that Savannah is literally built on the dead?
They placed cemeteries all over the city, and then as it grew they just kind of built on top of them.
Great.
I can't wait to go to bed tonight.
But I guess you're not gonna be there to protect me, right?
You didn't sleep on the couch last night 'cause of Jenny, did you?
Peyton, you need to know that when I saw your face in the airport,
I don't think I've been that happy since I've been here.
But?
People always leave, right?
There's this on-ramp that I pass every day on my way to work.
Every day I think, "I could get on that on-ramp, and I'd be in Tree Hill in 6 hours, 24 minutes".
And I'd be with you.
But I'd be without Jenny.
And I can't do that.
You could have called on the phone and told me that.
It's not like you're in hiding.
It would have been too hard to heard your voice, Peyton, to feel us again.
My life is here now.
And as much as I would love to, I'd -- you're leaving.
And I'm the one that's gonna be left with this dull pain in my heart, and that pain -- it took me a long time to let go of.
S orry.
It's okay.
I get it.
Trust me.
Peyton.
Peyton!
You know what?
Every song ends, Jake.
Is that any reason not to enjoy the music?
Forget it.
I'll just -
- I'll see you tomorrow.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm just dreaming.
I guess the world's still out there.
You know, I have a chance to make some overtime today, but I can call and cancel if you want.
No, no, no, no, no.
You should go.
I can spend the day alone.
Or I could make a call and maybe I could get you Jenny for the day.
Could you really?
Jake, that would be great.
I love that little girl.
I know you do, and I love you for that.
Where's your head at, Peyton?
- Me?
- Yeah.
Uh, I'm all over the place.
I don't know.
It's just like -- like, you know that feeling you get on a sunday where you just have the whole day to yourself, and it's been great, and then you remember you have to go to school the next day,
so it ruins the rest of the night?
I have to go home tomorrow, and so I've got that feeling.
It's like sunday night.
You know, somebody once told me that every song ends, but that's no reason not to enjoy the music.
Ellie told me that.
Well, she was right.
Tomorrow's gonna hurt like hell.
We both know that.
But we're here together now, hmm?
Marvin McFabulous, I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.
Actually, I got here early.
Well, welcome to the dark side, my friend -- deception for lunch, payback for dinner, and pie for breakfast?
You guys want some breakfast?
- Pie.
- Pie.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Just a cup of coffee, please.
Hot uncle Cooper!
Why don't you come join us?
Hey, Brooke.
Hi.
Hey, I'm Cooper.
Hey, I'm, uh, Steve.
Yeah, you're the flower delivery guy, right?
- How's it going?
- Oh, I've been better.
You know, my girl never did say who those flowers were from.
She wouldn't tell you?
Sounds like a shady character.
No, no, I just think it was personal, that's all.
All she'd say is that they were from somebody she really cared about.
Look, we all have our histories, right?
I just think this guy must have meant something to her.
Anyway, you guys don't want to hear about that.
So this is like home court for you two, right?
What's good here?
I ordered the pie, but I don't think I have the stomach for it.
But --
This new girlfriend -- you care about her, right?
Yeah, I do.
That's good.
Take care of her.
Okay.
Mouth, what about the plan?
Payback?
Pain?
Pie?
She's lying to him.
I know, but I got to talk to Rachel first, okay?
I really wanted pie.
Hey.
How you feeling, sleepyhead?
Ohh, like ass.
Mmm, sorry.
Lucky for you, this cures that.
I hope so.
Oh, thank you.
I am wiped out.
We just got to win this one last game, though.
Otherwise whitey has to retire without making the playoffs.
Well, we can't let that happen.
Where does it hurt?
Everywhere.
You guys are playing Oak Lake tonight?
Yeah.
They're undefeated.
My boyfriend Damien West is good?
Yeah, he's pretty good.
He's an ass, though, sort of like a young version of my dad.
It's actually hurt me to see what's happened with your relationship with Dan.
I just -- especially now that you're playing so well.
You should be able to enjoy that with your father.
Yeah.
It's a little late for that, though.
Probably just as well.
The way I've been feeling, I don't think I have another great game in me.
I don't believe that for a second.
Besides, I'm gonna help you, and Damien West doesn't stand a chance.
I love you.
You know that?
I love you, too.
You always help me.
Damn it, you need to put a shirt on.
You're too sexy!
God!
Take a look at this building right over here.
That's where daddy fought for you, and then he threw up in the alley.
And then right over here is the Savannah College of Art and Design where maybe I'll go one day.
That way I can spend more time with you and daddy.
How's it feel knowing your man's season ends tonight?
Don't count on it.
Ooh, you smell great.
I can't wait to see how you taste.
Get off me!
It's okay.
Give into it, baby.
Hey, Damien West?
Dan Scott.
That's Mayor Dan Scott, and if you ever touch my daughter-in-law, Haley, again,
I'll end your career.
Have a good game.
Jake, we're home!
Hey, there's my girl.
- Come on.
- Go see dada.
How was your day -- okay?
People always leave, right?
I mean, that's why you and I can't be together -- because you have to stay, and I have to go back to Tree Hill.
But I was thinking -- why do I have to go back?
Jake...
I want to stay.
I want to stay here with you.
Hey, Nathan.
Nathan.
Look, dad...
What is this?
You said you were gonna back off, Dan, with me and with Nathan.
A restraining order?
It requires you to stay at least 100 feet away from us at all times, starting tonight.
Sorry, Mr. Mayor.
You signed off on this, Nathan?
Yeah.
Actually, dad, it was my idea.
All night, Scott.
You can't stop me.
Take a look at the scoreboard.
In case you can't count, it's tied.
Come on, Damien!
This guy owns you!
You did that on purpose!
Hey, bitch, get off!
Break it up!
Break it up.
You're okay?
Let's get set here.
The refs appear to have it under control now.
Nathan Scott steps to the line for two free throws.
Okay, gentlemen, let's get set.
Shooting two.
First one's dead.
Hold on, guys.
I got blood here.
Coach!
And it looks like Nathan has some blood on his jersey.
Let's hope it's not serious.
He needs stitches.
Sorry, son, you're done for tonight.
What?
No way.
Forget it.
Nathan, you're bleeding.
Coach, there's no way I'm leaving this game.
If I need stitches, then stitch me up.
Nathan.
Coach, if we lose this game, then you lose your shot at the state championships, and so do I, so does this team.
And we played in your crappy, old gym.
We ran two-a-days until we puked.
I let Tim shower with me.
Come on.
Don't let a punk like Damien West take this away from us.
All right, take him back there and stitch him up.
Find him another jersey.
If his mother says anything about this, it was your idea.
Get in there.
What the hell are you laughing at?
Two things I know -- one, you don't deserve a guy like Mouth, and two, deception always catches up to you...
Always.
It looks like Nathan Scott is going to have to leave the game.
We'll take a break and be right back.
Hey.
Who's winning?
It's tied, fourth quarter.
So, you want to tell me about this master plan of yours?
What makes you think that you can actually leave Tree Hill?
Well, I'm gonna be out of high school in a couple months anyway, right?
So I can just get my G.E.D. now.
And the College of Art and Design is a great school.
And, I mean, my dad's always gone.
Haley has Nathan, and Brooke has Lucas, so... maybe I can stay.
You know, Peyton, there's a reason that you're listening to that game tonight.
And I don't care what you say -- you'd miss it, all of it.
Do you miss it?
Every day.
Jake.
Do you love me?
Yeah, I do.
I walked around Savannah all day today, and I couldn't shake that feeling of it being a sunday evening.
And it's always gonna be without you.
You're the one that makes that feeling go away.
So, yes, there are things about my life that I would miss.
But I'd miss you more.
And the roar you hear is for Nathan Scott stepping back on the court.
And he's wearing Lucas Scott's jersey!
But is it too late?
The Ravens trail by 9, with just over a minute left.
You should have stayed in the locker room, Scott.
Your season's over.
We'll see about that.
Yes!
Yay, Nathan!
Another 3 by Nathan, and just like that, the Ravens trail by 3, with 35 seconds left.
Let's hope there's some magic still left in that jersey.
What's the matter, West?
You don't want to take the big shot?
Ball!
Well, well, someone has to make their free throws, huh?
Don't brick it, now.
Take it easy, man.
It's an old backboard.
That's right, nice and easy.
Don't think about it.
Wow, nice touch.
And the Ravens are gonna get the ball back, down by 3, with 18 seconds on the clock and Nathan Scott on fire.
I'm telling you, folks -- win or lose, you're gonna regret missing this one.
The two teams are huddled up now.
We'll get back to live action in a moment.
All right, listen to me.
That Scott kid is having the game of his life, so they'll be going to him.
When he catches the ball, you foul him.
They'll only get two free throws, and they're down by three.
I can stop him, coach.
No way, it's too risky.
We foul him, end their season.
We get out of here undefeated.
Now, let's go, fellows!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- "Win" on 3. 1, 2, 3...
- Win!
Now, you listen to me.
When you step out on that floor, take it all in because someday you're gonna look back on it and want it all again.
When you do, make sure it's for the right reasons.
Win or lose, leave it all on the floor.
Now, "Ravens" on 3.
- 1, 2, 3...
- Ravens!
You know, it's been said that we just don't recognize the significant moments of our lives while they're happening.
We grow complacent with ideas or things or people, and we take them for granted.
And it's usually not until that thing is about to be taken away from you that you realize how wrong you've been, that you realize how much you really need it, how much you love it.
God, I love this game.
Foul him!
Foul!
No way.
Nobody fouls him!
He's mine!
Come on, Scott.
You got nothing.
We got a foul here.
He called a foul!
The shot is good, the game is tied, and there's a foul on Damien West.
Unbelievable!
Nathan Scott will get one free throw to win it, with no time left on the clock.
So Nathan Scott will have one free throw to win it for the Ravens.
Okay, you need to make 20 free throws in a row.
You miss one, you start over.
Dad, I'm tired.
Nathan, I'm only trying to make you better.
Someday you're gonna thank me.
You ever heard the expression, "the best things in life are free"?
Well, that expression's true.
Okay, this is it.
Oh, m--
You got nothing, Scott, nothing!
Ravens win it!
Ravens win it!
So, you've been quiet tonight.
- I'm worried about you.
- Why?
What if I say you can stay and somehow we convince your father to let you do it?
This life is hard, Peyton.
You've got all this fire inside of you.
I don't want to be the guy that puts that out.
You already did that the night you left Tree Hill.
I've spent a lot of time being miserable, Jake.
It's like misery's an old friend.
And it tricks you sometimes into thinking that it's just always gonna be there, that you can't be happy.
But you can.
You can walk away from pain, and I think being in love's the best way to do it.
What do you feel when we're together?
Hope.
I do, too.
And we deserve that.
You okay?
Not really.
I kind of got caught in a lie tonight.
With Cooper?
About your age?
I didn't tell him anything.
Why not?
Because if he makes you feel the way that I felt with you, then I want that for you.
Brooke was right.
I don't deserve you.
I'm sorry, Mouth.
Never say you're sorry, Rachel.
I mean, that was one of your rules, right?
It's a stupid rule.
You know, one of these days you're gonna have to quit lying and just be yourself.
Maybe today's that day.
Hey, you were great tonight.
I think so.
Nathan.
I know.
I know.
I'm not supposed to get close to you.
But... tonight I walked into that gym the Mayor of Tree Hill... but I finished the night a father on the outside looking in... at a son who deserves better.
I wanted to tell you... how proud of you I am.
And this has nothing to do with basketball.
I'm proud of you for the choices you've made with your life.
I'm proud of you for the man that you've become.
I love you.
Every once in a while, people step up.
They rise above themselves.
Sometimes they surprise you.
- Okay, you can't be here.
- Cooper --
How could you lie like that, huh?
How old are you?
Please tell me you're not a freshman.
I'm 17.
Just relax.
In North Carolina I only have to be 16 for us to be together.
Maybe by law, but in my book, you got to be a hell of a lot older than that.
You have to go.
I'm sorry.
- Cooper.
- Don't.
You know you still want me, Cooper.
You know it and I know it.
You really should go.
And sometimes they fall short.
Life is funny sometimes.
It can push pretty hard.
But if you look close enough, you find hope...
Mama.
...in the words of children in the bars of a song...
What's wrong, Peyton?
...and in the eyes of someone you love.
And if you're lucky -
- I mean, if you're the luckiest person on this entire planet -- the person you love decides to love you back.
Do you want to get married?

Cleo you've got spirit,Cleo enjoy it and enjoy all you can you and your friends maybe,you'd be alright eventually
wait!
don't go what do you mean?
- It arrived!
- What?
The package I ordered from Rome!
They imported it from Africa!
It's a hand-carved mask.
It's supposed to represent the god of fertility.
I thought we could use all the help we can get.
What are you yelling for?
And I suppose the horn represents...
Take it away!
It's horrible!
Perfect.
And how much did this little ugly impulse cost us?
They must have sent me the wrong one.
I'll call the shipping house tomorrow.
What?
Yeah, like this thing will help me get it up.
Bill, what happened to the lights?
Bill?
I think we blew a fuse or something.
Bill!
Have you gone to check the breakers?
Bill?
Bill, is that you?
Bill!
I think there's someone in the house!
Who is that?
Who's there?
Bill, where are you?
Bill?
Are you up there?
Yes.
All ten fuses blew out.
I thought I saw someone in the bedroom and outside.
It's not funny, you bastard!
Take that horrible thing off.
Take it off.
- Now you belong to me.
- Get off me!
No!
Oh, God.
It's okay, honey.
We're almost there.
It'll be about another 50 miles.
Why didn't you wake me?
I'm late for my pills.
You were sleeping so peacefully.
I thought you could use the rest.
Same dream?
It's not a dream, I told you.
As long as you keep believing it, the longer your stay will be.
Committing me to this hospital won't do any good.
But at this point, all the doctors seem to differ.
That's because they can't help me.
No one can.
But as long as I keep taking my medication--
Come on, Ellen.
The Zyprexa isn't helping.
You're getting worse.
- You have to come to terms with the fact--
- What, that I'm insane?
- Nobody has ever said that to you.
- You know what?
One day, the day the Nightmare Man guts me, you'll know I was telling the truth.
No chance at all that it just might have created this man as an excuse to justify your-- okay, our-- our intimacy issues?
If they can prove that I'm just crazy, it'd be a big relief off my mind.
Oh, shit.
What?
What?
You didn't fill it up before we left?
I had other concerns on my mind, okay?
Please, don't start, Ellen.
Not now.
Call AAA.
I'll bet the reception is shitty out there.
Yeah.
No reception.
Well...
Flag down a passing car or something!
Do you see many cars on this road?
I don't think I've seen one for the last 80 miles.
Yeah, but I did see a gas station sign back there.
It's probably another ten miles from here.
But it's getting dark.
So the sooner I go, the better.
I don't-
- I don't think it's a good idea.
I don't intend on spending the rest of my life in this car, do you?
Why don't I go with you?
Just what I need.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, Ellen.
Ten miles of "l told you so?"
No, thank you very much.
At least if you feel lonely, there is some company back in the trunk.
What company?
Nothing.
- I should be back in a few hours.
- What-
- What company?
Christ, Ellen, forget about it!
What's in the trunk, Bill?
Nothing!
Christ, Ellen!
I'm sorry I said anything, all right?
Just forget about it.
- What's in the trunk, Bill?
- Nothing.
And you won't show me nothing because...
How could you?
Listen to me!
- Listen to me, honey!
- Oh, God!
It wasn't my idea.
Dr. Evans thought it could help, you know, later on as part of your therapy.
He told me to bring it along.
Bastard.
You fucking bastard!
Great.
And what good is that going to do?
I don't want it around!
Or you!
Fine!
It's gone!
I'm gone.
Now, please, get back in the car and lock the doors.
I should be back in a few hours.
Let's go.
Listen, Ellen, this-- this whole ordeal will be over before you know it.
Hey.
Try to get some sleep, okay?
Good-bye, Bill.
Lock the doors.
Oh, God.
Christ, Bill, where are you?
Great.
Probably never even saw me.
Keys.
Trunk.
Hello?
Oh, no!
No.
No.
Oh, my God.
Low battery.
Goddamnit!
No.
Leave me alone!
Oh, goddamnit!
No, no.
Stop it.
Get control of yourself.
Remember what the doctor said.
There's nothing out there.
Pull yourself together, Ellen.
I just forgot to close the trunk, that's all.
I blew on the horn and jarred it loose.
That's what happened.
Now get out of the car.
And close the goddamn trunk!
Oh, God!
No!
No!
Stop!
Stop it!
Get away from me!
Oh, God.
No!
Help!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Jesus!
Oh, God, no!
Get away from me!
Oh, God!
No!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where the hell are you?
Fantastic meal, Trinity.
She's done better.
Fuck you.
Don't tempt me.
Jack, you sure I can't help?
No, no, it's all right.
We have an arrangement:
she cooks and I clean.
Wow, you have him trained already, and the wedding's what, three whole months away?
Just one of Jack's many tricks.
Can he roll over and beg, too?
Because, you know, Ed here is really good at that.
Yeah, but I bet the begging usually comes first, am I right?
And the begging is constant.
Yeah, begging me to stop.
He can barely keep up with me.
I guess nothing's changed since college.
You know it.
A little young, no?
Old enough.
A little old, no?
Just right.
- You know, this is an amazing place.
- Told you.
When your best friend's about to tie the knot with Mr. Just Right, it's cause to celebrate.
So let's get this party started.
- Game time.
- Hide and seek?
Erotic Truth or Dare.
No!
No!
Please!
No!
What do you want from me?
What do you want?
All right, Ed.
Start us off.
I don't know what to ask.
- You need help, baby?
- Yeah.
Okay.
We're playing teams?
Jack...truth or dare?
Truth.
Bigger turn on: guy and girl--
- Girls, okay?
Girls.
- No, no, no.
That wasn't the question.
No premature exclamation, please.
Go.
Guy and girl... or two girls together?
- Two girls.
- Yes!
- What?
- We have an honest one.
This is gonna be a good game.
My turn.
Mia, truth or dare?
Why, dare, of course.
Okay.
Show us how you make Ed beg.
My pleasure.
Oops.
Okay.
That's enough.
All right.
Trinity's turn.
Truth or dare?
Dare.
- Orgasm.
- Excuse me?
Men don't believe we fake it, so show them the truth if you dare.
Oh, God.
No!
Oh, God.
Yes.
Oh, baby.
Oh, God!
Yes!
Oh, God!
Jack!
Jack!
Help me!
I need another drink.
No!
You okay, honey?
Honey?
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
I am...great.
But it's my turn, okay?
Truth or dare?
Truth.
No!
- What is your favorite sexual--
- Wait.
Did you guys hear that?
Could have sworn I heard something.
Well, it's the woods.
Probably all sorts of animals out there.
Yeah, you're right.
Probably nothing.
Well, let's find out.
Hello?
Anyone there?
See anything?
No.
- What are you doing?
- It's called protection.
I meant before.
Ed's "two girls" question?
It's an inside joke.
Don't worry.
Nobody caught on.
- Unless you told him.
- Never.
Got it?
Never.
That's what you said in college.
Well, this time, I really mean it.
Jesus!
What?
There's bears out here.
- Pays to be cautious.
- Right.
Yeah, well...
let's go back inside.
I'm not in the killing mood tonight.
Oh, God!
Help me!
Help me!
What the fuck?
Who is that?
Oh, my God.
Quick, get her in the house!
- He's trying to kill me.
- What?
Who?
- He's trying to kill me.
- Who?
Jack!
What are you doing?
Come on!
Get back inside!
What happened?
Get the door!
Door!
Oh, my gosh!
- Trin, take her!
- Put her on the couch!
- He's real!
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.
I knew he was real!
Calm down.
It's gonna be all right.
She's bleeding bad.
- We need some towels here, come on!
- All right!
- Calm down.
- No!
He's still out there!
- He's trying to kill me!
- Wait a minute.
Who's trying to kill you?
He's the devil.
He's the devil, I tell you!
With a knife!
Shit!
I dropped my crossbow outside.
- You what?
- Put the fire out.
- What are you doing?
- There's a madman outside.
Do we really want to give him a clear shot?
We're lit up in here like the Fourth of July.
Good point.
I'm so cold!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I'm so cold.
You could use another shirt.
What happened?
Oh, my God!
He attacked me!
Then I ran and saw your house!
He's the one!
The Nightmare Man!
Oh, God.
The Nightmare Man?
Is that what she said?
- I'm not crazy!
- We should just call the police, okay?
I'm not-
- I'm not...
I'm not crazy.
William!
We have to warn my husband!
He's still out there!
- Where?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
- We ran out of gas.
- Sure.
And then-- then he went to go find some and then he never came back!
Oh, my God!
He may be dead!
He may be dead!
Trinity, will you please go get one of my sweaters from my bag?
Okay.
It's okay.
- What's your husband's cell phone number?
- What's the number?
I think he's still out there.
I didn't see anyone out there.
Is that supposed to make us feel better or worse?
I'm just saying.
Nice job with the fire, brainiac.
- Yeah, you didn't tell me it was gas.
- Moron.
Come on.
Come on.
Is he there?
He's dead.
I know he's dead.
- Hello?
- Hello!
Hello.
My name is Jack.
Look, I'm here with your wife.
- Let me talk to him, please!
- Yeah.
- Bill!
- Ellen!
Thank God.
I was worried sick when I got back to the car and you were gone.
Where are you?
He tried to kill me!
The Nightmare Man!
He's real!
I barely escaped.
Are you all right?
Are you safe?
Yeah, I think so.
Some nice people brought me in.
But he's still out there, in the flesh.
He-
- He got free somehow.
Honey, you've got to calm down.
I'll be right over.
Now let me talk to the guy who called me.
Okay.
I love you.
Get here soon.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Here.
- Hello.
Jack was it?
- Hello.
Look, I think she's gonna be okay, but we should call the police.
- Jack, can I talk to you for a moment?
- Sure.
Can you go into another room, away from my wife?
I don't think we should split up.
If this guy's still out there--
There's nobody out there, Jack.
My wife has some problems, issues.
We were on our way to Devonshine Institute.
You know, the mental facility.
I'm committing her tonight.
Look, I'll be right back, okay?
Can I get you anything?
A glass of water?
Or something stronger?
We got some Brazilian tequila back there.
- Kicks some major ass.
- No, thank you.
I can use one.
But, man, you should see her.
She is bruised and she's cut up.
Oh, God.
She probably did it to herself.
That's why I have to commit her.
Now please, Jack.
You must watch her carefully at all times.
She could be dangerous to herself and-- and perhaps others.
- But...
- What's up?
She said he was chasing her, okay?
Did you see anybody chasing her?
No.
Believe me, Jack, I love my wife...very much.
Let me handle her.
We don't need to involve the police now, do we, Jack?
No.
No, I guess not.
Thank you very much.
Now just tell me where you are.
I'll be right over.
Yeah, hold on a minute.
I'll put Mia on.
It's her place.
She knows the area a lot better than me.
- Unbelievable.
- What's up?
- Well, he needs directions.
- Okay.
And I think it's best if our guest just sticks to water this evening, okay?
- Why?
- He'll explain.
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi.
- Where are you at now?
- Ten miles from the gas station.
Okay, no, you're gonna have to double back.
It's really tricky at night, so keep your eyes open.
Okay.
He's on his way.
Thank you.
Can I see you two downstairs for a moment?
It's important.
It's okay.
He's not inside me anymore.
I'm free.
Come on.
Yeah, it should take you about 40 minutes.
But be careful.
There's a madman out there with a knife according to your wife.
I think he's got my crossbow, too.
Well, that's-- that's just perfect.
Is the psycho out there in the woods or in here with us?
You can't really believe she did that to herself.
Well, in a delusional state, anything's possible.
Come on.
I mean, she's a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
You heard what she said up there.
"He's not inside me anymore?"
Yeah, yeah.
What's that about?
I've been thinking she's a little--
"Inside me?"
You geniuses ever hear of the term "rape?"
Whoa, hey, I'm just telling you what he told me, okay?
And I didn't see anybody else out there.
- Did either of you?
- No.
But what's that old expression?
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.
Yeah, yeah, I got another one for you.
- You can't judge a book by its cover.
- Enough, all right?
Look, arguing amongst ourselves isn't gonna do anybody any good, okay?
Look, we can all see she's been through something horrible tonight.
She's the victim, and I'm sorry, but I'm just not scared of her.
She's terrified and harmless.
Where are my pills?
Jesus Christ.
- What's going on?
- No fucking clue.
She just jumped up screaming.
My pills!
Where are my pills?
Hey, lady, mellow out!
- What are you looking for?
- My medication!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I dropped it in the woods.
Help me find my pills?
Whoa!
Hey, hey!
- Wait, wait.
- You can't go out there.
You don't understand!
Hey, your husband's on his way!
Relax!
And what about that guy out there trying to kill you?
None of you understands.
He got out somehow!
What do you mean "got out?" Out of prison?
An institution?
No, out of me, okay?
Maybe-
- Maybe the pills drove him out.
That's what I'm thinking.
That's why I have to keep taking them or he's gonna be able to get back in!
Look, don't worry, okay?
Nobody's getting in here.
This house is secure, all right?
Not inside the house!
Inside of me!
What?
That's what he wants.
He wants to take over my body, take me over from the inside.
Help me find my pills, or we're all gonna die.
Fine.
Fuckin' A!
About time someone clocked that crazy bitch.
Whoa.
What?
What choice did I have, okay?
She was about to hurt someone...or herself.
Well, good thing they're not married.
You can't call him a wife-beater.
Just help me get her on the couch.
Where do you think you're going?
For a breath of fresh air.
- Downstairs?
- Outside.
- Are you crazy?
- No, but she is.
You all heard her.
"The killer's inside of me."
She's a psycho escaped from a nuthouse.
She didn't escape; she was on her way to being committed.
Same difference!
Whatever, all right?
Right now, I'll feel a whole lot safer out there than in here.
See ya!
Bye!
- What?
- He's your boyfriend.
You deal with him.
Thanks a lot.
I can't believe you hit her.
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
What are we gonna do when she wakes up?
Apologize, I guess?
I wouldn't forgive you.
Yeah, but I wouldn't hit you.
Promise?
Trin, come on.
Baby, look, I love you, okay, with all of my heart.
Our marriage is never gonna be like this.
Even if I was possessed by a demon?
Yeah, spinning head and all.
Good cough.
Feels nice to me.
Jesus, Mia.
You made me drop my cigarette.
Oh, no.
You'll live longer.
Besides, I hate those things.
So does this mean you're on my side now?
There are no sides.
But being out alone in the middle of the woods, murderer or not, not usually the brightest idea.
Anyway, had to get something from the car.
- Why us, huh?
- Why what?
Why didn't you go to someone else's house?
Because we're the only ones up here.
Nobody comes up here before snowfall.
Everything's locked up for the summer.
And what a shame.
They miss all this fun.
It's been all right.
- Come on.
- Oh, jeez!
So, are escaped mental patients a normal occurrence around these parts?
No, my dad was a hunter.
You never when something might turn up that requires a bullet.
Or someone.
Dude, come on, she's sick.
She needs our help.
I actually feel sorry for her husband.
Don't you?
Could you imagine having to spend the rest of your life with someone like that?
I swear to God, if I ever got that way,
I'd rather someone just shoot me just to put me out of my fucking misery.
You could shoot yourself.
Right.
Suicide's a sin.
Don't wanna spend eternity in hell.
A religious tomboy.
Well, with an overactive sex drive.
Let's not forget about that.
Oh, never.
That's my favorite part.
Really?
Your favorite part.
You know, because I thought...
I thought this was your favorite part.
Well, it's been so long since I've seen it,
I-
- I can't remember.
Poor baby.
How about this?
Does this help?
Yeah, yeah.
It's, uh...
It's coming back to me now.
Well...what does a full moon do to you?
God, Mia.
You're killing me here.
Fuck!
Fuck!
God, there's someone out there.
Are you sure?
You don't believe me?
Go ask Ed.
Oh, wait, you can't.
He's dead.
What?
Stay away from the windows.
Is this a joke?
If it is, Ed is not laughing.
The arrow sticking through his mouth is making damn sure of that.
Oh, my God!
Where is he?
What did you see?
I don't know.
I didn't get a good look.
Dressed in black, wearing a mask, demonic devil-faced thing.
So she's not crazy.
I wouldn't say that.
But there's definitely a killer out there.
Who are you calling?
Who I should have called in the first place, the police.
The number's on the fridge.
The station's a good hour and a half away, though.
- Maybe there's a patrol car in the area.
- Yeah, we can always hope.
You can't always get through, though.
Great vacation, Mia.
There is no fucking way in hell I could have predicted this!
If it turns out you set this whole thing up to fuck up my marriage--
Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're the one that needs some psychiatric help because you still don't get it.
The whole fucking world does not revolve around you.
You're one to talk!
- Shut up.
- Fuck you.
- Hello?
- Yes.
Hello.
We have an emergency situation here.
There's a man, a killer, outside of our house.
He was chasing a woman.
He's already killed one of our friends.
- Where's this at?
- At a friend's house.
Mia, what's the address here?
453-
- You know what?
Here, just give me the phone.
Hold on a second.
I'll put the owner on the line.
Watch the windows.
Hey, it's okay, all right?
I'm here.
Hey, what's going on between you two?
- You argue like a couple--
- Nothing!
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
Yeah, it's 43511 Chandler Boulevard.
It's just this whole night-- a nightmare.
No, I don't know who she is.
She's this crazy bitch who showed up screaming.
The gun!
Use the gun!
Yeah, thanks.
Bye.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He might be up on the roof.
Yeah, or gone back down.
An hour?
They really said an hour?
I told you the station's not nearby and I think they had recent cutbacks.
Well, that's okay.
I mean, we have a gun.
He only has a crossbow, right?
And a knife for those at home playing along.
Unless you believe she made up that part, too.
Well, if he tries to get in, then we'll just...
You know?
Do you know how to use that thing?
I've seen films.
Okay?
I mean, come on.
How hard can it be?
You just point and shoot, right?
Give it back to Mia.
When she shoots, she usually connects.
It's true.
Fine.
- Jack?
- Yeah.
What were you gonna ask me before?
- What?
- During Truth or Dare.
My favorite sexual what?
I really don't think now's a good time to continue the game.
- Okay, honey?
- I know.
I'm just curious.
Yeah, me, too.
Position.
Favorite sexual position, okay?
- Bottom.
- Bottom.
Not me, I mean her--
Fucking shit.
- What happened?
- Oh, shit!
- What's going on?
- Stay down.
You were right.
We all saw him.
You saw him?
The nightmare Man?
Look, I'm sorry we didn't believe you, okay?
- Speak for yourself.
- You saw his face?
Yeah.
Devil horns, dark eyes, evil grin, everything you described.
He killed Ed!
What was that?
Sounded like a window breaking.
My guess: not the cat.
- Do you have a cat?
- No.
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.
Oh, shit.
- I'll go look for her.
Stay here.
- Jack, no.
- Jack.
- I'll be all right.
It's all my fault.
What are you doing with that knife?
He's here because of me.
I drove him out and I put all of you in danger.
There's only one thing to do.
Look, just put the knife down, okay?
Yeah, we have a gun.
It's better.
He's still connected to me, and I...
I have to sever the connection.
God, we need some more towels!
- More towels!
- Fuck!
Hurry!
We have to stop the bleeding!
Hey, guys, let's not forget about our other problem here!
- Out of towels!
- Not the problem I'm referring to!
Come on!
Trin, out of the way!
No!
Die, you bastard!
Die!
God!
No!
Trinity!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
I'll kill him for this.
I'll kill him if it's the last--
Jack, no!
Oh, God.
Why-
- Why am I tied up?
Because I think you've caused enough trouble this evening.
Did you find my pills?
So sorry.
Just been a little busy dealing with other things this evening.
Then you have to kill me.
It's the evil.
It's still inside.
I can feel it.
No, lady!
The evil's out there!
You're just one fucked up, unlucky individual.
I'm sorry about your friends.
You have any idea who this psychopath is?
I thought it was the demon, but it's not.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
No, I mean the evil entity, from the mask.
Now I know it never left me.
I can still feel it inside.
What the fuck did he do to you?
The same thing he's gonna do to you if you don't leave very soon.
No.
The police and your husband are on their way, and it's just safer to stay right here.
No, you're wrong.
Look, I'm actually getting a little sick and tired of all your negativity.
I am this close to losing it myself, so either shut the fuck up or talk about something positive, okay?
Positive?
Yeah, positive!
You know, make shit up!
Tell a story that starts with "Once upon a time,"
maybe ends with "happily ever after."
You know, uplifting bullshit from now on, okay?
Got it?
What's your name?
Mia.
What's yours?
Ellen.
Can't really say I'm pleased to meet you, Ellen.
You want a drink?
No, thanks.
Whatever.
More for me.
Shit.
Stay right there.
Is that a joke?
Yes.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck.
What's going on?
False alarm.
What is that?
- Car pulling up.
- The police?
I think it's your husband.
The killer's still out there.
- I know!
- Well, he doesn't.
We have to warn him.
He still thinks this is all in my mind.
If I go out there, we both die.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hello?
Ellen?
Anybody there?
Get your ass in here!
Welcome to our nightmare.
Oh, God!
- Bill!
- Ellen!
Hey, stay away from the windows!
I lost my pills in the woods.
What the hell is going on here?
Everything your wife said is true.
There's a killer outside and we've got the body count to prove it.
Why is my wife tied down?
She tried to kill herself.
What?
I haven't had my pills since we were in the car.
They're wearing off.
I won't be able to control it anymore.
It's okay, honey.
I'll get you some more pills soon.
- When?
- As soon as we get out of here.
I've got some more in the car.
Look, I think everyone needs to calm down.
Why don't you give me this gun?
Don't you think enough people have been hurt already tonight?
I didn't do this and neither did your wife!
Pay attention.
There's someone out there trying to kill us.
And overall, he's been pretty fucking successful!
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
So put down the gun so at least we can talk this thing out.
Fuck that!
This rifle's the only reason why we're still alive.
So what's the plan?
Are you gonna force us to stay here all night?
You can leave whenever you want to.
Personally, I'm staying right here for the police.
The police can't help us now.
What did I say about your negativity?
I need my pills.
Untie me.
Can I at least go out and get her pills?
You can try.
I wouldn't risk it.
Bill, she's right.
There's somebody out there.
Let me go.
Ellen, just wait here.
I'll be back with your pills, and we'll be leaving shortly.
It's your funeral.
Bill, don't go!
We'll go together!
Just hang tight, honey.
This nightmare is almost over.
Either very brave or very stupid.
Take your pick.
He just doesn't understand.
Nobody understands.
Hello?
Somebody out there?
Well, well, well.
You really fucked this one up good, didn't you?
So I made one or two little mistakes!
- I'm sorry!
- Little mistakes?
It looks like the only person you didn't kill is my wife.
She's a lot tougher than I thought.
Everything was going perfectly.
The car ran out of gas exactly where it was supposed to.
I made sure she stayed in the car and her cell phone battery was dead so she couldn't call for any help.
All that you had to do was show up and fucking kill her like we discussed.
Things got a little complicated.
I was playing with her, you know?
A little foreplay before the main event, and she locked me in the fucking trunk!
And you didn't mention anything about any houses nearby in the woods.
Nearby?
It took me 50 minutes to find this place.
Your wife found a shortcut.
And whose fault is that?
All right, yes!
I fucked up, I admit it.
I'm sorry.
I'm fixing it.
Kill one, kill five, it doesn't make a difference to me.
But everyone isn't dead.
There is a girl in there with a rifle.
Yeah.
She's been a pain.
I'll handle her.
You better do it soon.
They said the police are on their way.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Okay, look, since you're here, can you help out?
You know, go in, distract them, grab the gun.
- I'll do the rest.
- This is your mess.
I'm waiting right here until the job is done.
I told them I was looking for her pills.
She dropped them in the woods.
Thanks.
But I'm gonna still keep looking for them until you finish your job.
Fine!
Get the fuck out of here.
Hey!
I'm not paying for any extra bodies.
Moron.
It's too late!
Oh, my God!
Dear God!
It's coming!
Stop it.
Calm down.
You're making too much--
It's too late!
Here it comes!
What the fuck is up with her?
Is this a private party?
Or can anybody join?
No monsters allowed.
Come on.
Come on, what's taking him so long?
Bill.
Christ, Ellen.
What happened?
I'm chilly.
How did you-- I mean, that mess--
Don't talk about that.
Come and make love to me.
Come on, Billy.
Let's make a baby.
What?
Look, honey, you've been through a lot tonight.
You're not yourself.
Mm-hmm, that's very true, but don't let that stop you.
There are four dead people out there.
The police are on their way, honey.
You're hurt.
We're covered in blood.
Hey, I found your pills.
So sweet!
But it looks like you're the one that needs a pill.
Did you just come from your little whore's place, hmm?
Spending more of my money on her?
I should suck you dry!
Is that what the problem with Mr. Limpy is?
What are you babbling about?
Is that why you hired that not-so-nice man to play with me tonight?
You're right, sweetie.
You're not making any sense.
You can't lie to me.
I can see into your soul.
Let me go!
Listen, whatever it was, it's a lie.
So all the affairs?
The private business trips for two?
The secret bank accounts?
All lies?
How do you know about all that?
Because your wife isn't crazy, William.
Never was.
The pills were working.
But tonight, thanks to you,
I was able to come out and play.
Now...
Give us one last kiss.
Leaving?
But I'm not finished.
Shit!
Fuck.
This can't be happening.
You know, I can be a puppet master, too!
You're almost too pathetic to kill.
But then again, it is fun to squash a bug.
Found your heart.
Feels so small.
Perhaps it's broken.
Yep.
Broken.
Now we're even.
One left.
How is this possible?
How is this possible?
Mia...
Where are you going, Mia?
No stars.
The darkness is closing in, isn't it?
What do you want from me?
Leave me alone!
There's something that I need.
This?
This is it?
Is this what you want?
Huh?
This?
Is this what you want?
Then take it!
Then take it!
Take it!
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
Or found the medication sooner.
Yeah, right!
Oh, baby, yeah!
Put it on!
Put it on.
You bitch!
It takes one to know one.
Die, motherfucker!
Die!
Rest in peace.
Let me in.
- I need a new home.
- No!
There's always another way.
No!
Where's the Captain?
He's around back, searching the place.
Captain!
Captain McCormac!
I found one survivor!
What, are you waiting for a medal?
- No, sir.
- Then lead the way.
- Who is he?
- She.
Did she say anything?
Not yet.
Whoa.
And I don't think she's ever going to.
I take it she's not the one.
I don't get it.
She was right here.
Yeah, well, "was" seems to be the operative word here.
Okay, listen to me.
I want you to go back to the house, get the others.
We're gonna comb the entire area, and I want some answers, okay?
This kind of thing does not happen on my watch!
Jesus!
Stay where you are!
Kill me.
Please kill me.
You don't understand.
He killed them.
Now it's inside me.
It's inside me.
Right.
It's inside you.
Got it.
But what is...it?
Evil.
Say that again?
Inside me.
And how are we today?
Fine.
Where are my pills?
You seem to be improving, Mia.
Fine.
Great.
Where are my pills?
And how is that evil inside you doing?
It's under control as long as I have my pills!
Well, we've got some good news for you.
Wonder-- Oh, wonderful.
We decided to take you off your meds for a while.
You can't do that!
They're the only thing that's keeping us safe.
I need my pills!
You don't know what will happen if I don't have my pills!
We're just gonna have to wait and find out, now, aren't we?
No.
Yes, we will.

- It arrived!
- What?
The package I ordered from Rome!
They imported it from Africa!
It's a hand-carved mask.
It's supposed to represent the god of fertility.
I thought we could use all the help we can get.
What are you yelling for?
And I suppose the horn represents...
Take it away!
It's horrible!
Perfect.
And how much did this little ugly impulse cost us?
They must have sent me the wrong one.
I'll call the shipping house tomorrow.
What?
Yeah, like this thing will help me get it up.
Bill, what happened to the lights?
Bill?
I think we blew a fuse or something.
Bill!
Have you gone to check the breakers?
Bill?
Bill, is that you?
Bill!
I think there's someone in the house!
Who is that?
Who's there?
Bill, where are you?
Bill?
Are you up there?
Yes.
All ten fuses blew out.
I thought I saw someone in the bedroom and outside.
It's not funny, you bastard!
Take that horrible thing off.
Take it off.
- Now you belong to me.
- Get off me!
No!
Oh, God.
It's okay, honey.
We're almost there.
It'll be about another 50 miles.
Why didn't you wake me?
I'm late for my pills.
You were sleeping so peacefully.
I thought you could use the rest.
Same dream?
It's not a dream, I told you.
As long as you keep believing it, the longer your stay will be.
Committing me to this hospital won't do any good.
But at this point, all the doctors seem to differ.
That's because they can't help me.
No one can.
But as long as I keep taking my medication...
Come on, Ellen.
The Zyprexa isn't helping.
You're getting worse.
- You have to come to terms with the fact...
- What, that I'm insane?
- Nobody has ever said that to you.
- You know what?
One day, the day the Nightmare Man guts me, you'll know I was telling the truth.
No chance at all that it just might have created this man as an excuse to justify your... okay, our... our intimacy issues?
If they can prove that I'm just crazy, it'd be a big relief off my mind.
Oh, shit.
What?
What?
You didn't fill it up before we left?
I had other concerns on my mind, okay?
Please, don't start, Ellen.
Not now.
Call AAA.
I'll bet the reception is shitty out there.
Yeah.
No reception.
Well...
Flag down a passing car or something!
Do you see many cars on this road?
I don't think I've seen one for the last 80 miles.
Yeah, but I did see a gas station sign back there.
It's probably another ten miles from here.
But it's getting dark.
So the sooner I go, the better.
I don't...
I don't think it's a good idea.
I don't intend on spending the rest of my life in this car, do you?
Why don't I go with you?
Just what I need.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, Ellen.
Ten miles of "I told you so?"
No, thank you very much.
At least if you feel lonely, there is some company back in the trunk.
What company?
Nothing.
- I should be back in a few hours.
- What...
What company?
Christ, Ellen, forget about it!
What's in the trunk, Bill?
Nothing!
Christ, Ellen!
I'm sorry I said anything, all right?
Just forget about it.
- What's in the trunk, Bill?
- Nothing.
And you won't show me nothing because...
How could you?
Listen to me!
- Listen to me, honey!
- Oh, God!
It wasn't my idea.
Dr. Evans thought it could help, you know, later on as part of your therapy.
He told me to bring it along.
Bastard.
You fucking bastard!
Great.
And what good is that going to do?
I don't want it around!
Or you!
Fine!
It's gone!
I'm gone.
Now, please, get back in the car and lock the doors.
I should be back in a few hours.
Let's go.
Listen, Ellen, this... this whole ordeal will be over before you know it.
Hey.
Try to get some sleep, okay?
Good-bye, Bill.
Lock the doors.
Oh, God.
Christ, Bill, where are you?
Great.
Probably never even saw me.
Keys.
Trunk.
Hello?
Oh, no!
No.
No.
Oh, my God.
Low battery.
Goddamnit!
No.
Leave me alone!
Oh, goddamnit!
No, no.
Stop it.
Get control of yourself.
Remember what the doctor said.
There's nothing out there.
Pull yourself together, Ellen.
I just forgot to close the trunk, that's all.
I blew on the horn and jarred it loose.
That's what happened.
Now get out of the car.
And close the goddamn trunk!
Oh, God!
No!
No!
Stop!
Stop it!
Get away from me!
Oh, God.
No!
Help!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Jesus!
Oh, God, no!
Get away from me!
Oh, God!
No!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where the hell are you?
Fantastic meal, Trinity.
She's done better.
Fuck you.
Don't tempt me.
Jack, you sure I can't help?
No, no, it's all right.
We have an arrangement:
She cooks and I clean.
Wow, you have him trained already, and the wedding's what, three whole months away?
Just one of Jack's many tricks.
Can he roll over and beg, too?
Because, you know, Ed here is really good at that.
Yeah, but I bet the begging usually comes first, am I right?
And the begging is constant.
Yeah, begging me to stop.
He can barely keep up with me.
I guess nothing's changed since college.
You know it.
A little young, no?
Old enough.
A little old, no?
Just right.
- You know, this is an amazing place.
- Told you.
When your best friend's about to tie the knot with Mr. Just Right, it's cause to celebrate.
So let's get this party started.
- Game time.
- Hide and seek?
Erotic Truth or Dare.
No!
No!
Please!
No!
What do you want from me?
What do you want?
All right, Ed.
Start us off.
I don't know what to ask.
- You need help, baby?
- Yeah.
Okay.
We're playing teams?
Jack... truth or dare?
Truth.
Bigger turn on:
Guy and girl...
- Girls, okay?
Girls.
- No, no, no.
That wasn't the question.
No premature exclamation, please.
Go.
Guy and girl... or two girls together?
- Two girls.
- Yes!
- What?
- We have an honest one.
This is gonna be a good game.
My turn.
Mia, truth or dare?
Why, dare, of course.
Okay.
Show us how you make Ed beg.
My pleasure.
Oops.
Okay.
That's enough.
All right.
Trinity's turn.
Truth or dare?
Dare.
- Orgasm.
- Excuse me?
Men don't believe we fake it, so show them the truth if you dare.
Oh, God.
No!
Oh, God.
Yes.
Oh, baby.
Oh, God!
Yes!
Oh, God!
Jack!
Jack!
Help me!
I need another drink.
No!
You okay, honey?
Honey?
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
I am... great.
But it's my turn, okay?
Truth or dare?
Truth.
No!
- What is your favorite sexual...
- Wait.
Did you guys hear that?
Could have sworn I heard something.
Well, it's the woods.
Probably all sorts of animals out there.
Yeah, you're right.
Probably nothing.
Well, let's find out.
Hello?
Anyone there?
See anything?
No.
- What are you doing?
- It's called protection.
I meant before.
Ed's "two girls" question?
It's an inside joke.
Don't worry.
Nobody caught on.
- Unless you told him.
- Never.
Got it?
Never.
That's what you said in college.
Well, this time, I really mean it.
Jesus!
What?
There's bears out here.
- Pays to be cautious.
- Right.
Yeah, well...
let's go back inside.
I'm not in the killing mood tonight.
Oh, God!
Help me!
Help me!
What the fuck?
Who is that?
Oh, my God.
Quick, get her in the house!
- He's trying to kill me.
- What?
Who?
- He's trying to kill me.
- Who?
Jack!
What are you doing?
Come on!
Get back inside!
What happened?
Get the door!
Door!
Oh, my gosh!
- Trin, take her!
- Put her on the couch!
- He's real!
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.
I knew he was real!
Calm down.
It's gonna be all right.
She's bleeding bad.
- We need some towels here, come on!
- All right!
- Calm down.
- No!
He's still out there!
- He's trying to kill me!
- Wait a minute.
Who's trying to kill you?
He's the devil.
He's the devil, I tell you!
With a knife!
Shit!
I dropped my crossbow outside.
- You what?
- Put the fire out.
- What are you doing?
- There's a madman outside.
Do we really want to give him a clear shot?
We're lit up in here like the Fourth of July.
Good point.
I'm so cold!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I'm so cold.
You could use another shirt.
What happened?
Oh, my God!
He attacked me!
Then I ran and saw your house!
He's the one!
The Nightmare Man!
Oh, God.
The Nightmare Man?
Is that what she said?
- I'm not crazy!
- We should just call the police, okay?
I'm not...
I'm not...
I'm not crazy.
William!
We have to warn my husband!
He's still out there!
- Where?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
- We ran out of gas.
- Sure.
And then... then he went to go find some and then he never came back!
Oh, my God!
He may be dead!
He may be dead!
Trinity, will you please go get one of my sweaters from my bag?
Okay.
It's okay.
- What's your husband's cell phone number?
- What's the number?
I think he's still out there.
I didn't see anyone out there.
Is that supposed to make us feel better or worse?
I'm just saying.
Nice job with the fire, brainiac.
- Yeah, you didn't tell me it was gas.
- Moron.
Come on.
Come on.
Is he there?
He's dead.
I know he's dead.
- Hello?
- Hello!
Hello.
My name is Jack.
Look, I'm here with your wife.
- Let me talk to him, please!
- Yeah.
- Bill!
- Ellen!
Thank God.
I was worried sick when I got back to the car and you were gone.
Where are you?
He tried to kill me!
The Nightmare Man!
He's real!
I barely escaped.
Are you all right?
Are you safe?
Yeah, I think so.
Some nice people brought me in.
But he's still out there, in the flesh.
He...
He got free somehow.
Honey, you've got to calm down.
I'll be right over.
Now let me talk to the guy who called me.
Okay.
I love you.
Get here soon.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Here.
- Hello.
Jack was it?
- Hello.
Look, I think she's gonna be okay, but we should call the police.
- Jack, can I talk to you for a moment?
- Sure.
Can you go into another room, away from my wife?
I don't think we should split up.
If this guy's still out there...
There's nobody out there, Jack.
My wife has some problems, issues.
We were on our way to Devonshine Institute.
You know, the mental facility.
I'm committing her tonight.
Look, I'll be right back, okay?
Can I get you anything?
A glass of water?
Or something stronger?
We got some Brazilian tequila back there.
- Kicks some major ass.
- No, thank you.
I can use one.
But, man, you should see her.
She is bruised and she's cut up.
Oh, God.
She probably did it to herself.
That's why I have to commit her.
Now please, Jack.
You must watch her carefully at all times.
She could be dangerous to herself and... and perhaps others.
- But...
- What's up?
She said he was chasing her, okay?
Did you see anybody chasing her?
No.
Believe me, Jack, I love my wife... very much.
Let me handle her.
We don't need to involve the police now, do we, Jack?
No.
No, I guess not.
Thank you very much.
Now just tell me where you are.
I'll be right over.
Yeah, hold on a minute.
I'll put Mia on.
It's her place.
She knows the area a lot better than me.
- Unbelievable.
- What's up?
- Well, he needs directions.
- Okay.
And I think it's best if our guest just sticks to water this evening, okay?
- Why?
- He'll explain.
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi.
- Where are you at now?
- Ten miles from the gas station.
Okay, no, you're gonna have to double back.
It's really tricky at night, so keep your eyes open.
Okay.
He's on his way.
Thank you.
Can I see you two downstairs for a moment?
It's important.
It's okay.
He's not inside me anymore.
I'm free.
Come on.
Yeah, it should take you about 40 minutes.
But be careful.
There's a madman out there with a knife according to your wife.
I think he's got my crossbow, too.
Well, that's... that's just perfect.
Is the psycho out there in the woods or in here with us?
You can't really believe she did that to herself.
Well, in a delusional state, anything's possible.
Come on.
I mean, she's a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
You heard what she said up there.
"He's not inside me anymore?"
Yeah, yeah.
What's that about?
I've been thinking she's a little...
"Inside me?"
You geniuses ever hear of the term "rape?"
Whoa, hey, I'm just telling you what he told me, okay?
And I didn't see anybody else out there.
- Did either of you?
- No.
But what's that old expression?
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.
Yeah, yeah, I got another one for you.
- You can't judge a book by its cover.
- Enough, all right?
Look, arguing amongst ourselves isn't gonna do anybody any good, okay?
Look, we can all see she's been through something horrible tonight.
She's the victim, and I'm sorry, but I'm just not scared of her.
She's terrified and harmless.
Where are my pills?
Jesus Christ.
- What's going on?
- No fucking clue.
She just jumped up screaming.
My pills!
Where are my pills?
Hey, lady, mellow out!
- What are you looking for?
- My medication!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I dropped it in the woods.
Help me find my pills?
Whoa!
Hey, hey!
- Wait, wait.
- You can't go out there.
You don't understand!
Hey, your husband's on his way!
Relax!
And what about that guy out there trying to kill you?
None of you understands.
He got out somehow!
What do you mean "got out?" Out of prison?
An institution?
No, out of me, okay?
Maybe...
Maybe the pills drove him out.
That's what I'm thinking.
That's why I have to keep taking them or he's gonna be able to get back in!
Look, don't worry, okay?
Nobody's getting in here.
This house is secure, all right?
Not inside the house!
Inside of me!
What?
That's what he wants.
He wants to take over my body, take me over from the inside.
Help me find my pills, or we're all gonna die.
Fine.
Fuckin' A!
About time someone clocked that crazy bitch.
Whoa.
What?
What choice did I have, okay?
She was about to hurt someone... or herself.
Well, good thing they're not married.
You can't call him a wife-beater.
Just help me get her on the couch.
Where do you think you're going?
For a breath of fresh air.
- Downstairs?
- Outside.
- Are you crazy?
- No, but she is.
You all heard her.
"The killer's inside of me."
She's a psycho escaped from a nuthouse.
She didn't escape; she was on her way to being committed.
Same difference!
Whatever, all right?
Right now, I'll feel a whole lot safer out there than in here.
See ya!
Bye!
- What?
- He's your boyfriend.
You deal with him.
Thanks a lot.
I can't believe you hit her.
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
What are we gonna do when she wakes up?
Apologize, I guess?
I wouldn't forgive you.
Yeah, but I wouldn't hit you.
Promise?
Trin, come on.
Baby, look, I love you, okay, with all of my heart.
Our marriage is never gonna be like this.
Even if I was possessed by a demon?
Yeah, spinning head and all.
Good cough.
Feels nice to me.
Jesus, Mia.
You made me drop my cigarette.
Oh, no.
You'll live longer.
Besides, I hate those things.
So does this mean you're on my side now?
There are no sides.
But being out alone in the middle of the woods, murderer or not, not usually the brightest idea.
Anyway, had to get something from the car.
- Why us, huh?
- Why what?
Why didn't you go to someone else's house?
Because we're the only ones up here.
Nobody comes up here before snowfall.
Everything's locked up for the summer.
And what a shame.
They miss all this fun.
It's been all right.
- Come on.
- Oh, jeez!
So, are escaped mental patients a normal occurrence around these parts?
No, my dad was a hunter.
You never when something might turn up that requires a bullet.
Or someone.
Dude, come on, she's sick.
She needs our help.
I actually feel sorry for her husband.
Don't you?
Could you imagine having to spend the rest of your life with someone like that?
I swear to God, if I ever got that way,
I'd rather someone just shoot me just to put me out of my fucking misery.
You could shoot yourself.
Right.
Suicide's a sin.
Don't wanna spend eternity in hell.
A religious tomboy.
Well, with an overactive sex drive.
Let's not forget about that.
Oh, never.
That's my favorite part.
Really?
Your favorite part.
You know, because I thought...
I thought this was your favorite part.
Well, it's been so long since I've seen it, I...
I can't remember.
Poor baby.
How about this?
Does this help?
Yeah, yeah.
It's, uh...
It's coming back to me now.
Well... what does a full moon do to you?
God, Mia.
You're killing me here.
Fuck!
Fuck!
God, there's someone out there.
Are you sure?
You don't believe me?
Go ask Ed.
Oh, wait, you can't.
He's dead.
What?
Stay away from the windows.
Is this a joke?
If it is, Ed is not laughing.
The arrow sticking through his mouth is making damn sure of that.
Oh, my God!
Where is he?
What did you see?
I don't know.
I didn't get a good look.
Dressed in black, wearing a mask, demonic devil-faced thing.
So she's not crazy.
I wouldn't say that.
But there's definitely a killer out there.
Who are you calling?
Who I should have called in the first place, the police.
The number's on the fridge.
The station's a good hour and a half away, though.
- Maybe there's a patrol car in the area.
- Yeah, we can always hope.
You can't always get through, though.
Great vacation, Mia.
There is no fucking way in hell I could have predicted this!
If it turns out you set this whole thing up to fuck up my marriage...
Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're the one that needs some psychiatric help because you still don't get it.
The whole fucking world does not revolve around you.
You're one to talk!
- Shut up.
- Fuck you.
- Hello?
- Yes.
Hello.
We have an emergency situation here.
There's a man, a killer, outside of our house.
He was chasing a woman.
He's already killed one of our friends.
- Where's this at?
- At a friend's house.
Mia, what's the address here?
453...
You know what?
Here, just give me the phone.
Hold on a second.
I'll put the owner on the line.
Watch the windows.
Hey, it's okay, all right?
I'm here.
Hey, what's going on between you two?
- You argue like a couple...
- Nothing!
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
Yeah, it's 43511 Chandler Boulevard.
It's just this whole night...
a nightmare.
No, I don't know who she is.
She's this crazy bitch who showed up screaming.
The gun!
Use the gun!
Yeah, thanks.
Bye.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He might be up on the roof.
Yeah, or gone back down.
An hour?
They really said an hour?
I told you the station's not nearby and I think they had recent cutbacks.
Well, that's okay.
I mean, we have a gun.
He only has a crossbow, right?
And a knife for those at home playing along.
Unless you believe she made up that part, too.
Well, if he tries to get in, then we'll just...
You know?
Do you know how to use that thing?
I've seen films.
Okay?
I mean, come on.
How hard can it be?
You just point and shoot, right?
Give it back to Mia.
When she shoots, she usually connects.
It's true.
Fine.
- Jack?
- Yeah.
What were you gonna ask me before?
- What?
- During Truth or Dare.
My favorite sexual what?
I really don't think now's a good time to continue the game.
- Okay, honey?
- I know.
I'm just curious.
Yeah, me, too.
Position.
Favorite sexual position, okay?
- Bottom.
- Bottom.
Not me, I mean her...
Fucking shit.
- What happened?
- Oh, shit!
- What's going on?
- Stay down.
You were right.
We all saw him.
You saw him?
The nightmare Man?
Look, I'm sorry we didn't believe you, okay?
- Speak for yourself.
- You saw his face?
Yeah.
Devil horns, dark eyes, evil grin, everything you described.
He killed Ed!
What was that?
Sounded like a window breaking.
My guess:
Not the cat.
- Do you have a cat?
- No.
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.
Oh, shit.
- I'll go look for her.
Stay here.
- Jack, no.
- Jack.
- I'll be all right.
It's all my fault.
What are you doing with that knife?
He's here because of me.
I drove him out and I put all of you in danger.
There's only one thing to do.
Look, just put the knife down, okay?
Yeah, we have a gun.
It's better.
He's still connected to me, and I...
I have to sever the connection.
God, we need some more towels!
- More towels!
- Fuck!
Hurry!
We have to stop the bleeding!
Hey, guys, let's not forget about our other problem here!
- Out of towels!
- Not the problem I'm referring to!
Come on!
Trin, out of the way!
No!
Die, you bastard!
Die!
God!
No!
Trinity!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
I'll kill him for this.
I'll kill him if it's the last...
Jack, no!
Oh, God.
Why...
Why am I tied up?
Because I think you've caused enough trouble this evening.
Did you find my pills?
So sorry.
Just been a little busy dealing with other things this evening.
Then you have to kill me.
It's the evil.
It's still inside.
I can feel it.
No, lady!
The evil's out there!
You're just one fucked up, unlucky individual.
I'm sorry about your friends.
You have any idea who this psychopath is?
I thought it was the demon, but it's not.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
No, I mean the evil entity, from the mask.
Now I know it never left me.
I can still feel it inside.
What the fuck did he do to you?
The same thing he's gonna do to you if you don't leave very soon.
No.
The police and your husband are on their way, and it's just safer to stay right here.
No, you're wrong.
Look, I'm actually getting a little sick and tired of all your negativity.
I am this close to losing it myself, so either shut the fuck up or talk about something positive, okay?
Positive?
Yeah, positive!
You know, make shit up!
Tell a story that starts with "Once upon a time,"
maybe ends with "happily ever after."
You know, uplifting bullshit from now on, okay?
Got it?
What's your name?
Mia.
What's yours?
Ellen.
Can't really say I'm pleased to meet you, Ellen.
You want a drink?
No, thanks.
Whatever.
More for me.
Shit.
Stay right there.
Is that a joke?
Yes.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck.
What's going on?
False alarm.
What is that?
- Car pulling up.
- The police?
I think it's your husband.
The killer's still out there.
- I know!
- Well, he doesn't.
We have to warn him.
He still thinks this is all in my mind.
If I go out there, we both die.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hello?
Ellen?
Anybody there?
Get your ass in here!
Welcome to our nightmare.
Oh, God!
- Bill!
- Ellen!
Hey, stay away from the windows!
I lost my pills in the woods.
What the hell is going on here?
Everything your wife said is true.
There's a killer outside and we've got the body count to prove it.
Why is my wife tied down?
She tried to kill herself.
What?
I haven't had my pills since we were in the car.
They're wearing off.
I won't be able to control it anymore.
It's okay, honey.
I'll get you some more pills soon.
- When?
- As soon as we get out of here.
I've got some more in the car.
Look, I think everyone needs to calm down.
Why don't you give me this gun?
Don't you think enough people have been hurt already tonight?
I didn't do this and neither did your wife!
Pay attention.
There's someone out there trying to kill us.
And overall, he's been pretty fucking successful!
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
So put down the gun so at least we can talk this thing out.
Fuck that!
This rifle's the only reason why we're still alive.
So what's the plan?
Are you gonna force us to stay here all night?
You can leave whenever you want to.
Personally, I'm staying right here for the police.
The police can't help us now.
What did I say about your negativity?
I need my pills.
Untie me.
Can I at least go out and get her pills?
You can try.
I wouldn't risk it.
Bill, she's right.
There's somebody out there.
Let me go.
Ellen, just wait here.
I'll be back with your pills, and we'll be leaving shortly.
It's your funeral.
Bill, don't go!
We'll go together!
Just hang tight, honey.
This nightmare is almost over.
Either very brave or very stupid.
Take your pick.
He just doesn't understand.
Nobody understands.
Hello?
Somebody out there?
Well, well, well.
You really fucked this one up good, didn't you?
So I made one or two little mistakes!
- I'm sorry!
- Little mistakes?
It looks like the only person you didn't kill is my wife.
She's a lot tougher than I thought.
Everything was going perfectly.
The car ran out of gas exactly where it was supposed to.
I made sure she stayed in the car and her cell phone battery was dead so she couldn't call for any help.
All that you had to do was show up and fucking kill her like we discussed.
Things got a little complicated.
I was playing with her, you know?
A little foreplay before the main event, and she locked me in the fucking trunk!
And you didn't mention anything about any houses nearby in the woods.
Nearby?
It took me 50 minutes to find this place.
Your wife found a shortcut.
And whose fault is that?
All right, yes!
I fucked up, I admit it.
I'm sorry.
I'm fixing it.
Kill one, kill five, it doesn't make a difference to me.
But everyone isn't dead.
There is a girl in there with a rifle.
Yeah.
She's been a pain.
I'll handle her.
You better do it soon.
They said the police are on their way.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Okay, look, since you're here, can you help out?
You know, go in, distract them, grab the gun.
- I'll do the rest.
- This is your mess.
I'm waiting right here until the job is done.
I told them I was looking for her pills.
She dropped them in the woods.
Thanks.
But I'm gonna still keep looking for them until you finish your job.
Fine!
Get the fuck out of here.
Hey!
I'm not paying for any extra bodies.
Moron.
It's too late!
Oh, my God!
Dear God!
It's coming!
Stop it.
Calm down.
You're making too much...
It's too late!
Here it comes!
What the fuck is up with her?
Is this a private party?
Or can anybody join?
No monsters allowed.
Come on.
Come on, what's taking him so long?
Bill.
Christ, Ellen.
What happened?
Bill... come and lie next to me.
I'm chilly.
How did you...
I mean, that mess...
Don't talk about that.
Come and make love to me.
Come on, Billy.
Let's make a baby.
What?
Look, honey, you've been through a lot tonight.
You're not yourself.
Mm-hmm, that's very true, but don't let that stop you.
There are four dead people out there.
The police are on their way, honey.
You're hurt.
We're covered in blood.
Hey, I found your pills.
So sweet!
But it looks like you're the one that needs a pill.
Did you just come from your little whore's place, hmm?
Spending more of my money on her?
I should suck you dry!
Is that what the problem with Mr. Limpy is?
What are you babbling about?
Is that why you hired that not-so-nice man to play with me tonight?
You're right, sweetie.
You're not making any sense.
You can't lie to me.
I can see into your soul.
Let me go!
Listen, whatever it was, it's a lie.
So all the affairs?
The private business trips for two?
The secret bank accounts?
All lies?
How do you know about all that?
Because your wife isn't crazy, William.
Never was.
The pills were working.
But tonight, thanks to you,
I was able to come out and play.
Now...
Give us one last kiss.
Leaving?
But I'm not finished.
Shit!
Fuck.
This can't be happening.
You know, I can be a puppet master, too!
You're almost too pathetic to kill.
But then again, it is fun to squash a bug.
Found your heart.
Feels so small.
Perhaps it's broken.
Yep.
Broken.
Now we're even.
One left.
How is this possible?
How is this possible?
Mia...
Where are you going, Mia?
No stars.
The darkness is closing in, isn't it?
What do you want from me?
Leave me alone!
There's something that I need.
This?
This is it?
Is this what you want?
Huh?
This?
Is this what you want?
Then take it!
Then take it!
Take it!
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
Or found the medication sooner.
Yeah, right!
Oh, baby, yeah!
Put it on!
Put it on.
You bitch!
It takes one to know one.
Die, motherfucker!
Die!
Rest in peace.
Let me in.
- I need a new home.
- No!
There's always another way.
No!
Where's the Captain?
He's around back, searching the place.
Captain!
Captain McCormac!
I found one survivor!
What, are you waiting for a medal?
- No, sir.
- Then lead the way.
- Who is he?
- She.
Did she say anything?
Not yet.
Whoa.
And I don't think she's ever going to.
I take it she's not the one.
I don't get it.
She was right here.
Yeah, well, "was" seems to be the operative word here.
Okay, listen to me.
I want you to go back to the house, get the others.
We're gonna comb the entire area, and I want some answers, okay?
This kind of thing does not happen on my watch!
Jesus!
Stay where you are!
Kill me.
Please kill me.
You don't understand.
He killed them.
Now it's inside me.
It's inside me.
Right.
It's inside you.
Got it.
But what is... it?
Evil.
Say that again?
Inside me.
And how are we today?
Fine.
Where are my pills?
You seem to be improving, Mia.
Fine.
Great.
Where are my pills?
And how is that evil inside you doing?
It's under control as long as I have my pills!
Well, we've got some good news for you.
Wonder...
Oh, wonderful.
We decided to take you off your meds for a while.
You can't do that!
They're the only thing that's keeping us safe.
I need my pills!
You don't know what will happen if I don't have my pills!
We're just gonna have to wait and find out, now, aren't we?
No.
Yes, we will.

Burbank, CA
- It arrived!
- What?
The package I ordered from Rome!
They imported it from Africa!
It's a hand-carved mask.
It's supposed to represent the god of fertility.
I thought we could use all the help we can get.
What are you yelling for?
And I suppose the horn represents...
Take it away!
It's horrible!
Perfect.
And how much did this little ugly impulse cost us?
They must have sent me the wrong one.
I'll call the shipping house tomorrow.
What?
Yeah, like this thing will help me get it up.
Bill, what happened to the lights?
Bill?
I think we blew a fuse or something.
Bill!
Have you gone to check the breakers?
Bill?
Bill, is that you?
Bill!
I think there's someone in the house!
Who is that?
Who's there?
Bill, where are you?
Bill?
Are you up there?
Yes.
All ten fuses blew out.
I thought I saw someone in the bedroom and outside.
It's not funny, you bastard!
Take that horrible thing off.
Take it off.
- Now you belong to me.
- Get off me!
No!
Oh, God.
It's okay, honey.
We're almost there.
It'll be about another 50 miles.
Why didn't you wake me?
I'm late for my pills.
You were sleeping so peacefully.
I thought you could use the rest.
Same dream?
It's not a dream, I told you.
As long as you keep believing it, the longer your stay will be.
Committing me to this hospital won't do any good.
But at this point, all the doctors seem to differ.
That's because they can't help me.
No one can.
But as long as I keep taking my medication--
Come on, Ellen.
The Zyprexa isn't helping.
You're getting worse.
- You have to come to terms with the fact--
- What, that I'm insane?
- Nobody has ever said that to you.
- You know what?
One day, the day the Nightmare Man guts me, you'll know I was telling the truth.
No chance at all that it just might have created this man as an excuse to justify your-- okay, our-- our intimacy issues?
If they can prove that I'm just crazy, it'd be a big relief off my mind.
Oh, shit.
What?
What?
You didn't fill it up before we left?
I had other concerns on my mind, okay?
Please, don't start, Ellen.
Not now.
Call AAA.
I'll bet the reception is shitty out there.
Yeah.
No reception.
Well...
Flag down a passing car or something!
Do you see many cars on this road?
I don't think I've seen one for the last 80 miles.
Yeah, but I did see a gas station sign back there.
It's probably another ten miles from here.
But it's getting dark.
So the sooner I go, the better.
I don't-
- I don't think it's a good idea.
I don't intend on spending the rest of my life in this car, do you?
Why don't I go with you?
Just what I need.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, Ellen.
Ten miles of "l told you so?"
No, thank you very much.
At least if you feel lonely, there is some company back in the trunk.
What company?
Nothing.
- I should be back in a few hours.
- What-
- What company?
Christ, Ellen, forget about it!
What's in the trunk, Bill?
Nothing!
Christ, Ellen!
I'm sorry I said anything, all right?
Just forget about it.
- What's in the trunk, Bill?
- Nothing.
And you won't show me nothing because...
How could you?
Listen to me!
- Listen to me, honey!
- Oh, God!
It wasn't my idea.
Dr. Evans thought it could help, you know, later on as part of your therapy.
He told me to bring it along.
Bastard.
You fucking bastard!
Great.
And what good is that going to do?
I don't want it around!
Or you!
Fine!
It's gone!
I'm gone.
Now, please, get back in the car and lock the doors.
I should be back in a few hours.
Let's go.
Listen, Ellen, this-- this whole ordeal will be over before you know it.
Hey.
Try to get some sleep, okay?
Good-bye, Bill.
Lock the doors.
Oh, God.
Christ, Bill, where are you?
Great.
Probably never even saw me.
Keys.
Trunk.
Hello?
Oh, no!
No.
No.
Oh, my God.
Low battery.
Goddamnit!
No.
Leave me alone!
Oh, goddamnit!
No, no.
Stop it.
Get control of yourself.
Remember what the doctor said.
There's nothing out there.
Pull yourself together, Ellen.
I just forgot to close the trunk, that's all.
I blew on the horn and jarred it loose.
That's what happened.
Now get out of the car.
And close the goddamn trunk!
Oh, God!
No!
No!
Stop!
Stop it!
Get away from me!
Oh, God.
No!
Help!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Jesus!
Oh, God, no!
Get away from me!
Oh, God!
No!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where the hell are you?
Fantastic meal, Trinity.
She's done better.
Fuck you.
Don't tempt me.
Jack, you sure I can't help?
No, no, it's all right.
We have an arrangement:
she cooks and I clean.
Wow, you have him trained already, and the wedding's what, three whole months away?
Just one of Jack's many tricks.
Can he roll over and beg, too?
Because, you know, Ed here is really good at that.
Yeah, but I bet the begging usually comes first, am I right?
And the begging is constant.
Yeah, begging me to stop.
He can barely keep up with me.
I guess nothing's changed since college.
You know it.
A little young, no?
Old enough.
A little old, no?
Just right.
- You know, this is an amazing place.
- Told you.
When your best friend's about to tie the knot with Mr. Just Right, it's cause to celebrate.
So let's get this party started.
- Game time.
- Hide and seek?
Erotic Truth or Dare.
No!
No!
Please!
No!
What do you want from me?
What do you want?
All right, Ed.
Start us off.
I don't know what to ask.
- You need help, baby?
- Yeah.
Okay.
We're playing teams?
Jack...truth or dare?
Truth.
Bigger turn on: guy and girl--
- Girls, okay?
Girls.
- No, no, no.
That wasn't the question.
No premature exclamation, please.
Go.
Guy and girl... or two girls together?
- Two girls.
- Yes!
- What?
- We have an honest one.
This is gonna be a good game.
My turn.
Mia, truth or dare?
Why, dare, of course.
Okay.
Show us how you make Ed beg.
My pleasure.
Oops.
Okay.
That's enough.
All right.
Trinity's turn.
Truth or dare?
Dare.
- Orgasm.
- Excuse me?
Men don't believe we fake it, so show them the truth if you dare.
Oh, God.
No!
Oh, God.
Yes.
Oh, baby.
Oh, God!
Yes!
Oh, God!
Jack!
Jack!
Help me!
I need another drink.
No!
You okay, honey?
Honey?
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
I am...great.
But it's my turn, okay?
Truth or dare?
Truth.
No!
- What is your favorite sexual--
- Wait.
Did you guys hear that?
Could have sworn I heard something.
Well, it's the woods.
Probably all sorts of animals out there.
Yeah, you're right.
Probably nothing.
Well, let's find out.
Hello?
Anyone there?
See anything?
No.
- What are you doing?
- It's called protection.
I meant before.
Ed's "two girls" question?
It's an inside joke.
Don't worry.
Nobody caught on.
- Unless you told him.
- Never.
Got it?
Never.
That's what you said in college.
Well, this time, I really mean it.
Jesus!
What?
There's bears out here.
- Pays to be cautious.
- Right.
Yeah, well...
let's go back inside.
I'm not in the killing mood tonight.
Oh, God!
Help me!
Help me!
What the fuck?
Who is that?
Oh, my God.
Quick, get her in the house!
- He's trying to kill me.
- What?
Who?
- He's trying to kill me.
- Who?
Jack!
What are you doing?
Come on!
Get back inside!
What happened?
Get the door!
Door!
Oh, my gosh!
- Trin, take her!
- Put her on the couch!
- He's real!
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.
I knew he was real!
Calm down.
It's gonna be all right.
She's bleeding bad.
- We need some towels here, come on!
- All right!
- Calm down.
- No!
He's still out there!
- He's trying to kill me!
- Wait a minute.
Who's trying to kill you?
He's the devil.
He's the devil, I tell you!
With a knife!
Shit!
I dropped my crossbow outside.
- You what?
- Put the fire out.
- What are you doing?
- There's a madman outside.
Do we really want to give him a clear shot?
We're lit up in here like the Fourth of July.
Good point.
I'm so cold!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I'm so cold.
You could use another shirt.
What happened?
Oh, my God!
He attacked me!
Then I ran and saw your house!
He's the one!
The Nightmare Man!
Oh, God.
The Nightmare Man?
Is that what she said?
- I'm not crazy!
- We should just call the police, okay?
I'm not-
- I'm not...
I'm not crazy.
William!
We have to warn my husband!
He's still out there!
- Where?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
- We ran out of gas.
- Sure.
And then-- then he went to go find some and then he never came back!
Oh, my God!
He may be dead!
He may be dead!
Trinity, will you please go get one of my sweaters from my bag?
Okay.
It's okay.
- What's your husband's cell phone number?
- What's the number?
I think he's still out there.
I didn't see anyone out there.
Is that supposed to make us feel better or worse?
I'm just saying.
Nice job with the fire, brainiac.
- Yeah, you didn't tell me it was gas.
- Moron.
Come on.
Come on.
Is he there?
He's dead.
I know he's dead.
- Hello?
- Hello!
Hello.
My name is Jack.
Look, I'm here with your wife.
- Let me talk to him, please!
- Yeah.
- Bill!
- Ellen!
Thank God.
I was worried sick when I got back to the car and you were gone.
Where are you?
He tried to kill me!
The Nightmare Man!
He's real!
I barely escaped.
Are you all right?
Are you safe?
Yeah, I think so.
Some nice people brought me in.
But he's still out there, in the flesh.
He-
- He got free somehow.
Honey, you've got to calm down.
I'll be right over.
Now let me talk to the guy who called me.
Okay.
I love you.
Get here soon.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Here.
- Hello.
Jack was it?
- Hello.
Look, I think she's gonna be okay, but we should call the police.
- Jack, can I talk to you for a moment?
- Sure.
Can you go into another room, away from my wife?
I don't think we should split up.
If this guy's still out there--
There's nobody out there, Jack.
My wife has some problems, issues.
We were on our way to Devonshine Institute.
You know, the mental facility.
I'm committing her tonight.
Look, I'll be right back, okay?
Can I get you anything?
A glass of water?
Or something stronger?
We got some Brazilian tequila back there.
- Kicks some major ass.
- No, thank you.
I can use one.
But, man, you should see her.
She is bruised and she's cut up.
Oh, God.
She probably did it to herself.
That's why I have to commit her.
Now please, Jack.
You must watch her carefully at all times.
She could be dangerous to herself and-- and perhaps others.
- But...
- What's up?
She said he was chasing her, okay?
Did you see anybody chasing her?
No.
Believe me, Jack, I love my wife...very much.
Let me handle her.
We don't need to involve the police now, do we, Jack?
No.
No, I guess not.
Thank you very much.
Now just tell me where you are.
I'll be right over.
Yeah, hold on a minute.
I'll put Mia on.
It's her place.
She knows the area a lot better than me.
- Unbelievable.
- What's up?
- Well, he needs directions.
- Okay.
And I think it's best if our guest just sticks to water this evening, okay?
- Why?
- He'll explain.
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi.
- Where are you at now?
- Ten miles from the gas station.
Okay, no, you're gonna have to double back.
It's really tricky at night, so keep your eyes open.
Okay.
He's on his way.
Thank you.
Can I see you two downstairs for a moment?
It's important.
It's okay.
He's not inside me anymore.
I'm free.
Come on.
Yeah, it should take you about 40 minutes.
But be careful.
There's a madman out there with a knife according to your wife.
I think he's got my crossbow, too.
Well, that's-- that's just perfect.
Is the psycho out there in the woods or in here with us?
You can't really believe she did that to herself.
Well, in a delusional state, anything's possible.
Come on.
I mean, she's a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
You heard what she said up there.
"He's not inside me anymore?"
Yeah, yeah.
What's that about?
I've been thinking she's a little--
"Inside me?"
You geniuses ever hear of the term "rape?"
Whoa, hey, I'm just telling you what he told me, okay?
And I didn't see anybody else out there.
- Did either of you?
- No.
But what's that old expression?
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.
Yeah, yeah, I got another one for you.
- You can't judge a book by its cover.
- Enough, all right?
Look, arguing amongst ourselves isn't gonna do anybody any good, okay?
Look, we can all see she's been through something horrible tonight.
She's the victim, and I'm sorry, but I'm just not scared of her.
She's terrified and harmless.
Where are my pills?
Jesus Christ.
- What's going on?
- No fucking clue.
She just jumped up screaming.
My pills!
Where are my pills?
Hey, lady, mellow out!
- What are you looking for?
- My medication!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I dropped it in the woods.
Help me find my pills?
Whoa!
Hey, hey!
- Wait, wait.
- You can't go out there.
You don't understand!
Hey, your husband's on his way!
Relax!
And what about that guy out there trying to kill you?
None of you understands.
He got out somehow!
What do you mean "got out?" Out of prison?
An institution?
No, out of me, okay?
Maybe-
- Maybe the pills drove him out.
That's what I'm thinking.
That's why I have to keep taking them or he's gonna be able to get back in!
Look, don't worry, okay?
Nobody's getting in here.
This house is secure, all right?
Not inside the house!
Inside of me!
What?
That's what he wants.
He wants to take over my body, take me over from the inside.
Help me find my pills, or we're all gonna die.
Fine.
Fuckin' A!
About time someone clocked that crazy bitch.
Whoa.
What?
What choice did I have, okay?
She was about to hurt someone...or herself.
Well, good thing they're not married.
You can't call him a wife-beater.
Just help me get her on the couch.
Where do you think you're going?
For a breath of fresh air.
- Downstairs?
- Outside.
- Are you crazy?
- No, but she is.
You all heard her.
"The killer's inside of me."
She's a psycho escaped from a nuthouse.
She didn't escape; she was on her way to being committed.
Same difference!
Whatever, all right?
Right now, I'll feel a whole lot safer out there than in here.
See ya!
Bye!
- What?
- He's your boyfriend.
You deal with him.
Thanks a lot.
I can't believe you hit her.
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
What are we gonna do when she wakes up?
Apologize, I guess?
I wouldn't forgive you.
Yeah, but I wouldn't hit you.
Promise?
Trin, come on.
Baby, look, I love you, okay, with all of my heart.
Our marriage is never gonna be like this.
Even if I was possessed by a demon?
Yeah, spinning head and all.
Good cough.
Feels nice to me.
Jesus, Mia.
You made me drop my cigarette.
Oh, no.
You'll live longer.
Besides, I hate those things.
So does this mean you're on my side now?
There are no sides.
But being out alone in the middle of the woods, murderer or not, not usually the brightest idea.
Anyway, had to get something from the car.
- Why us, huh?
- Why what?
Why didn't you go to someone else's house?
Because we're the only ones up here.
Nobody comes up here before snowfall.
Everything's locked up for the summer.
And what a shame.
They miss all this fun.
It's been all right.
- Come on.
- Oh, jeez!
So, are escaped mental patients a normal occurrence around these parts?
No, my dad was a hunter.
You never when something might turn up that requires a bullet.
Or someone.
Dude, come on, she's sick.
She needs our help.
I actually feel sorry for her husband.
Don't you?
Could you imagine having to spend the rest of your life with someone like that?
I swear to God, if I ever got that way,
I'd rather someone just shoot me just to put me out of my fucking misery.
You could shoot yourself.
Right.
Suicide's a sin.
Don't wanna spend eternity in hell.
A religious tomboy.
Well, with an overactive sex drive.
Let's not forget about that.
Oh, never.
That's my favorite part.
Really?
Your favorite part.
You know, because I thought...
I thought this was your favorite part.
Well, it's been so long since I've seen it,
I-
- I can't remember.
Poor baby.
How about this?
Does this help?
Yeah, yeah.
It's, uh...
It's coming back to me now.
Well...what does a full moon do to you?
God, Mia.
You're killing me here.
Fuck!
Fuck!
God, there's someone out there.
Are you sure?
You don't believe me?
Go ask Ed.
Oh, wait, you can't.
He's dead.
What?
Stay away from the windows.
Is this a joke?
If it is, Ed is not laughing.
The arrow sticking through his mouth is making damn sure of that.
Oh, my God!
Where is he?
What did you see?
I don't know.
I didn't get a good look.
Dressed in black, wearing a mask, demonic devil-faced thing.
So she's not crazy.
I wouldn't say that.
But there's definitely a killer out there.
Who are you calling?
Who I should have called in the first place, the police.
The number's on the fridge.
The station's a good hour and a half away, though.
- Maybe there's a patrol car in the area.
- Yeah, we can always hope.
You can't always get through, though.
Great vacation, Mia.
There is no fucking way in hell I could have predicted this!
If it turns out you set this whole thing up to fuck up my marriage--
Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're the one that needs some psychiatric help because you still don't get it.
The whole fucking world does not revolve around you.
You're one to talk!
- Shut up.
- Fuck you.
- Hello?
- Yes.
Hello.
We have an emergency situation here.
There's a man, a killer, outside of our house.
He was chasing a woman.
He's already killed one of our friends.
- Where's this at?
- At a friend's house.
Mia, what's the address here?
453-
- You know what?
Here, just give me the phone.
Hold on a second.
I'll put the owner on the line.
Watch the windows.
Hey, it's okay, all right?
I'm here.
Hey, what's going on between you two?
- You argue like a couple--
- Nothing!
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
Yeah, it's 43511 Chandler Boulevard.
It's just this whole night-- a nightmare.
No, I don't know who she is.
She's this crazy bitch who showed up screaming.
The gun!
Use the gun!
Yeah, thanks.
Bye.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He might be up on the roof.
Yeah, or gone back down.
An hour?
They really said an hour?
I told you the station's not nearby and I think they had recent cutbacks.
Well, that's okay.
I mean, we have a gun.
He only has a crossbow, right?
And a knife for those at home playing along.
Unless you believe she made up that part, too.
Well, if he tries to get in, then we'll just...
You know?
Do you know how to use that thing?
I've seen films.
Okay?
I mean, come on.
How hard can it be?
You just point and shoot, right?
Give it back to Mia.
When she shoots, she usually connects.
It's true.
Fine.
- Jack?
- Yeah.
What were you gonna ask me before?
- What?
- During Truth or Dare.
My favorite sexual what?
I really don't think now's a good time to continue the game.
- Okay, honey?
- I know.
I'm just curious.
Yeah, me, too.
Position.
Favorite sexual position, okay?
- Bottom.
- Bottom.
Not me, I mean her--
Fucking shit.
- What happened?
- Oh, shit!
- What's going on?
- Stay down.
You were right.
We all saw him.
You saw him?
The nightmare Man?
Look, I'm sorry we didn't believe you, okay?
- Speak for yourself.
- You saw his face?
Yeah.
Devil horns, dark eyes, evil grin, everything you described.
He killed Ed!
What was that?
Sounded like a window breaking.
My guess: not the cat.
- Do you have a cat?
- No.
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.
Oh, shit.
- I'll go look for her.
Stay here.
- Jack, no.
- Jack.
- I'll be all right.
It's all my fault.
What are you doing with that knife?
He's here because of me.
I drove him out and I put all of you in danger.
There's only one thing to do.
Look, just put the knife down, okay?
Yeah, we have a gun.
It's better.
He's still connected to me, and I...
I have to sever the connection.
God, we need some more towels!
- More towels!
- Fuck!
Hurry!
We have to stop the bleeding!
Hey, guys, let's not forget about our other problem here!
- Out of towels!
- Not the problem I'm referring to!
Come on!
Trin, out of the way!
No!
Die, you bastard!
Die!
God!
No!
Trinity!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
I'll kill him for this.
I'll kill him if it's the last--
Jack, no!
Oh, God.
Why-
- Why am I tied up?
Because I think you've caused enough trouble this evening.
Did you find my pills?
So sorry.
Just been a little busy dealing with other things this evening.
Then you have to kill me.
It's the evil.
It's still inside.
I can feel it.
No, lady!
The evil's out there!
You're just one fucked up, unlucky individual.
I'm sorry about your friends.
You have any idea who this psychopath is?
I thought it was the demon, but it's not.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
No, I mean the evil entity, from the mask.
Now I know it never left me.
I can still feel it inside.
What the fuck did he do to you?
The same thing he's gonna do to you if you don't leave very soon.
No.
The police and your husband are on their way, and it's just safer to stay right here.
No, you're wrong.
Look, I'm actually getting a little sick and tired of all your negativity.
I am this close to losing it myself, so either shut the fuck up or talk about something positive, okay?
Positive?
Yeah, positive!
You know, make shit up!
Tell a story that starts with "Once upon a time,"
maybe ends with "happily ever after."
You know, uplifting bullshit from now on, okay?
Got it?
What's your name?
Mia.
What's yours?
Ellen.
Can't really say I'm pleased to meet you, Ellen.
You want a drink?
No, thanks.
Whatever.
More for me.
Shit.
Stay right there.
Is that a joke?
Yes.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck.
What's going on?
False alarm.
What is that?
- Car pulling up.
- The police?
I think it's your husband.
The killer's still out there.
- I know!
- Well, he doesn't.
We have to warn him.
He still thinks this is all in my mind.
If I go out there, we both die.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hello?
Ellen?
Anybody there?
Get your ass in here!
Welcome to our nightmare.
Oh, God!
- Bill!
- Ellen!
Hey, stay away from the windows!
I lost my pills in the woods.
What the hell is going on here?
Everything your wife said is true.
There's a killer outside and we've got the body count to prove it.
Why is my wife tied down?
She tried to kill herself.
What?
I haven't had my pills since we were in the car.
They're wearing off.
I won't be able to control it anymore.
It's okay, honey.
I'll get you some more pills soon.
- When?
- As soon as we get out of here.
I've got some more in the car.
Look, I think everyone needs to calm down.
Why don't you give me this gun?
Don't you think enough people have been hurt already tonight?
I didn't do this and neither did your wife!
Pay attention.
There's someone out there trying to kill us.
And overall, he's been pretty fucking successful!
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
So put down the gun so at least we can talk this thing out.
Fuck that!
This rifle's the only reason why we're still alive.
So what's the plan?
Are you gonna force us to stay here all night?
You can leave whenever you want to.
Personally, I'm staying right here for the police.
The police can't help us now.
What did I say about your negativity?
I need my pills.
Untie me.
Can I at least go out and get her pills?
You can try.
I wouldn't risk it.
Bill, she's right.
There's somebody out there.
Let me go.
Ellen, just wait here.
I'll be back with your pills, and we'll be leaving shortly.
It's your funeral.
Bill, don't go!
We'll go together!
Just hang tight, honey.
This nightmare is almost over.
Either very brave or very stupid.
Take your pick.
He just doesn't understand.
Nobody understands.
Hello?
Somebody out there?
Well, well, well.
You really fucked this one up good, didn't you?
So I made one or two little mistakes!
- I'm sorry!
- Little mistakes?
It looks like the only person you didn't kill is my wife.
She's a lot tougher than I thought.
Everything was going perfectly.
The car ran out of gas exactly where it was supposed to.
I made sure she stayed in the car and her cell phone battery was dead so she couldn't call for any help.
All that you had to do was show up and fucking kill her like we discussed.
Things got a little complicated.
I was playing with her, you know?
A little foreplay before the main event, and she locked me in the fucking trunk!
And you didn't mention anything about any houses nearby in the woods.
Nearby?
It took me 50 minutes to find this place.
Your wife found a shortcut.
And whose fault is that?
All right, yes!
I fucked up, I admit it.
I'm sorry.
I'm fixing it.
Kill one, kill five, it doesn't make a difference to me.
But everyone isn't dead.
There is a girl in there with a rifle.
Yeah.
She's been a pain.
I'll handle her.
You better do it soon.
They said the police are on their way.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Okay, look, since you're here, can you help out?
You know, go in, distract them, grab the gun.
- I'll do the rest.
- This is your mess.
I'm waiting right here until the job is done.
I told them I was looking for her pills.
She dropped them in the woods.
Thanks.
But I'm gonna still keep looking for them until you finish your job.
Fine!
Get the fuck out of here.
Hey!
I'm not paying for any extra bodies.
Moron.
It's too late!
Oh, my God!
Dear God!
It's coming!
Stop it.
Calm down.
You're making too much--
It's too late!
Here it comes!
What the fuck is up with her?
Is this a private party?
Or can anybody join?
No monsters allowed.
Come on.
Come on, what's taking him so long?
Bill.
Christ, Ellen.
What happened?
I'm chilly.
How did you-- I mean, that mess--
Don't talk about that.
Come and make love to me.
Come on, Billy.
Let's make a baby.
What?
Look, honey, you've been through a lot tonight.
You're not yourself.
Mm-hmm, that's very true, but don't let that stop you.
There are four dead people out there.
The police are on their way, honey.
You're hurt.
We're covered in blood.
Hey, I found your pills.
So sweet!
But it looks like you're the one that needs a pill.
Did you just come from your little whore's place, hmm?
Spending more of my money on her?
I should suck you dry!
Is that what the problem with Mr. Limpy is?
What are you babbling about?
Is that why you hired that not-so-nice man to play with me tonight?
You're right, sweetie.
You're not making any sense.
You can't lie to me.
I can see into your soul.
Let me go!
Listen, whatever it was, it's a lie.
So all the affairs?
The private business trips for two?
The secret bank accounts?
All lies?
How do you know about all that?
Because your wife isn't crazy, William.
Never was.
The pills were working.
But tonight, thanks to you,
I was able to come out and play.
Now...
Give us one last kiss.
Leaving?
But I'm not finished.
Shit!
Fuck.
This can't be happening.
You know, I can be a puppet master, too!
You're almost too pathetic to kill.
But then again, it is fun to squash a bug.
Found your heart.
Feels so small.
Perhaps it's broken.
Yep.
Broken.
Now we're even.
One left.
How is this possible?
How is this possible?
Mia...
Where are you going, Mia?
No stars.
The darkness is closing in, isn't it?
What do you want from me?
Leave me alone!
There's something that I need.
This?
This is it?
Is this what you want?
Huh?
This?
Is this what you want?
Then take it!
Then take it!
Take it!
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
Or found the medication sooner.
Yeah, right!
Oh, baby, yeah!
Put it on!
Put it on.
You bitch!
It takes one to know one.
Die, motherfucker!
Die!
Rest in peace.
Let me in.
- I need a new home.
- No!
There's always another way.
No!
Where's the Captain?
He's around back, searching the place.
Captain!
Captain McCormac!
I found one survivor!
What, are you waiting for a medal?
- No, sir.
- Then lead the way.
- Who is he?
- She.
Did she say anything?
Not yet.
Whoa.
And I don't think she's ever going to.
I take it she's not the one.
I don't get it.
She was right here.
Yeah, well, "was" seems to be the operative word here.
Okay, listen to me.
I want you to go back to the house, get the others.
We're gonna comb the entire area, and I want some answers, okay?
This kind of thing does not happen on my watch!
Jesus!
Stay where you are!
Kill me.
Please kill me.
You don't understand.
He killed them.
Now it's inside me.
It's inside me.
Right.
It's inside you.
Got it.
But what is...it?
Evil.
Say that again?
Inside me.
And how are we today?
Fine.
Where are my pills?
You seem to be improving, Mia.
Fine.
Great.
Where are my pills?
And how is that evil inside you doing?
It's under control as long as I have my pills!
Well, we've got some good news for you.
Wonder-- Oh, wonderful.
We decided to take you off your meds for a while.
You can't do that!
They're the only thing that's keeping us safe.
I need my pills!
You don't know what will happen if I don't have my pills!
We're just gonna have to wait and find out, now, aren't we?
No.
Yes, we will.

- It arrived!
- What?
The package I ordered from Rome!
They imported it from Africa!
It's a hand-carved mask.
It's supposed to represent the god of fertility.
I thought we could use all the help we can get.
What are you yelling for?
And I suppose the horn represents...
Take it away!
It's horrible!
Perfect.
And how much did this little ugly impulse cost us?
They must have sent me the wrong one.
I'll call the shipping house tomorrow.
What?
Yeah, like this thing will help me get it up.
Bill, what happened to the lights?
Bill?
I think we blew a fuse or something.
Bill!
Have you gone to check the breakers?
Bill?
Bill, is that you?
Bill!
I think there's someone in the house!
Who is that?
Who's there?
Bill, where are you?
Bill?
Are you up there?
Yes.
All ten fuses blew out.
I thought I saw someone in the bedroom and outside.
It's not funny, you bastard!
Take that horrible thing off.
Take it off.
- Now you belong to me.
- Get off me!
No!
Oh, God.
It's okay, honey.
We're almost there.
It'll be about another 50 miles.
Why didn't you wake me?
I'm late for my pills.
You were sleeping so peacefully.
I thought you could use the rest.
Same dream?
It's not a dream, I told you.
As long as you keep believing it, the longer your stay will be.
Committing me to this hospital won't do any good.
But at this point, all the doctors seem to differ.
That's because they can't help me.
No one can.
But as long as I keep taking my medication--
Come on, Ellen.
The Zyprexa isn't helping.
You're getting worse.
- You have to come to terms with the fact--
- What, that I'm insane?
- Nobody has ever said that to you.
- You know what?
One day, the day the Nightmare Man guts me, you'll know I was telling the truth.
No chance at all that it just might have created this man as an excuse to justify your-- okay, our-- our intimacy issues?
If they can prove that I'm just crazy, it'd be a big relief off my mind.
Oh, shit.
What?
What?
You didn't fill it up before we left?
I had other concerns on my mind, okay?
Please, don't start, Ellen.
Not now.
Call AAA.
I'll bet the reception is shitty out there.
Yeah.
No reception.
Well...
Flag down a passing car or something!
Do you see many cars on this road?
I don't think I've seen one for the last 80 miles.
Yeah, but I did see a gas station sign back there.
It's probably another ten miles from here.
But it's getting dark.
So the sooner I go, the better.
I don't-
- I don't think it's a good idea.
I don't intend on spending the rest of my life in this car, do you?
Why don't I go with you?
Just what I need.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, Ellen.
Ten miles of "l told you so?"
No, thank you very much.
At least if you feel lonely, there is some company back in the trunk.
What company?
Nothing.
- I should be back in a few hours.
- What-
- What company?
Christ, Ellen, forget about it!
What's in the trunk, Bill?
Nothing!
Christ, Ellen!
I'm sorry I said anything, all right?
Just forget about it.
- What's in the trunk, Bill?
- Nothing.
And you won't show me nothing because...
How could you?
Listen to me!
- Listen to me, honey!
- Oh, God!
It wasn't my idea.
Dr. Evans thought it could help, you know, later on as part of your therapy.
He told me to bring it along.
Bastard.
You fucking bastard!
Great.
And what good is that going to do?
I don't want it around!
Or you!
Fine!
It's gone!
I'm gone.
Now, please, get back in the car and lock the doors.
I should be back in a few hours.
Let's go.
Listen, Ellen, this-- this whole ordeal will be over before you know it.
Hey.
Try to get some sleep, okay?
Good-bye, Bill.
Lock the doors.
Oh, God.
Christ, Bill, where are you?
Great.
Probably never even saw me.
Keys.
Trunk.
Hello?
Oh, no!
No.
No.
Oh, my God.
Low battery.
Goddamnit!
No.
Leave me alone!
Oh, goddamnit!
No, no.
Stop it.
Get control of yourself.
Remember what the doctor said.
There's nothing out there.
Pull yourself together, Ellen.
I just forgot to close the trunk, that's all.
I blew on the horn and jarred it loose.
That's what happened.
Now get out of the car.
And close the goddamn trunk!
Oh, God!
No!
No!
Stop!
Stop it!
Get away from me!
Oh, God.
No!
Help!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Jesus!
Oh, God, no!
Get away from me!
Oh, God!
No!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where the hell are you?
Fantastic meal, Trinity.
She's done better.
Fuck you.
Don't tempt me.
Jack, you sure I can't help?
No, no, it's all right.
We have an arrangement:
she cooks and I clean.
Wow, you have him trained already, and the wedding's what, three whole months away?
Just one of Jack's many tricks.
Can he roll over and beg, too?
Because, you know, Ed here is really good at that.
Yeah, but I bet the begging usually comes first, am I right?
And the begging is constant.
Yeah, begging me to stop.
He can barely keep up with me.
I guess nothing's changed since college.
You know it.
A little young, no?
Old enough.
A little old, no?
Just right.
- You know, this is an amazing place.
- Told you.
When your best friend's about to tie the knot with Mr. Just Right, it's cause to celebrate.
So let's get this party started.
- Game time.
- Hide and seek?
Erotic Truth or Dare.
No!
No!
Please!
No!
What do you want from me?
What do you want?
All right, Ed.
Start us off.
I don't know what to ask.
- You need help, baby?
- Yeah.
Okay.
We're playing teams?
Jack...truth or dare?
Truth.
Bigger turn on: guy and girl--
- Girls, okay?
Girls.
- No, no, no.
That wasn't the question.
No premature exclamation, please.
Go.
Guy and girl... or two girls together?
- Two girls.
- Yes!
- What?
- We have an honest one.
This is gonna be a good game.
My turn.
Mia, truth or dare?
Why, dare, of course.
Okay.
Show us how you make Ed beg.
My pleasure.
Oops.
Okay.
That's enough.
All right.
Trinity's turn.
Truth or dare?
Dare.
- Orgasm.
- Excuse me?
Men don't believe we fake it, so show them the truth if you dare.
Oh, God.
No!
Oh, God.
Yes.
Oh, baby.
Oh, God!
Yes!
Oh, God!
Jack!
Jack!
Help me!
I need another drink.
No!
You okay, honey?
Honey?
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
I am...great.
But it's my turn, okay?
Truth or dare?
Truth.
No!
- What is your favorite sexual--
- Wait.
Did you guys hear that?
Could have sworn I heard something.
Well, it's the woods.
Probably all sorts of animals out there.
Yeah, you're right.
Probably nothing.
Well, let's find out.
Hello?
Anyone there?
See anything?
No.
- What are you doing?
- It's called protection.
I meant before.
Ed's "two girls" question?
It's an inside joke.
Don't worry.
Nobody caught on.
- Unless you told him.
- Never.
Got it?
Never.
That's what you said in college.
Well, this time, I really mean it.
Jesus!
What?
There's bears out here.
- Pays to be cautious.
- Right.
Yeah, well...
let's go back inside.
I'm not in the killing mood tonight.
Oh, God!
Help me!
Help me!
What the fuck?
Who is that?
Oh, my God.
Quick, get her in the house!
- He's trying to kill me.
- What?
Who?
- He's trying to kill me.
- Who?
Jack!
What are you doing?
Come on!
Get back inside!
What happened?
Get the door!
Door!
Oh, my gosh!
- Trin, take her!
- Put her on the couch!
- He's real!
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.
I knew he was real!
Calm down.
It's gonna be all right.
She's bleeding bad.
- We need some towels here, come on!
- All right!
- Calm down.
- No!
He's still out there!
- He's trying to kill me!
- Wait a minute.
Who's trying to kill you?
He's the devil.
He's the devil, I tell you!
With a knife!
Shit!
I dropped my crossbow outside.
- You what?
- Put the fire out.
- What are you doing?
- There's a madman outside.
Do we really want to give him a clear shot?
We're lit up in here like the Fourth of July.
Good point.
I'm so cold!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I'm so cold.
You could use another shirt.
What happened?
Oh, my God!
He attacked me!
Then I ran and saw your house!
He's the one!
The Nightmare Man!
Oh, God.
The Nightmare Man?
Is that what she said?
- I'm not crazy!
- We should just call the police, okay?
I'm not-
- I'm not...
I'm not crazy.
William!
We have to warn my husband!
He's still out there!
- Where?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
- We ran out of gas.
- Sure.
And then-- then he went to go find some and then he never came back!
Oh, my God!
He may be dead!
He may be dead!
Trinity, will you please go get one of my sweaters from my bag?
Okay.
It's okay.
- What's your husband's cell phone number?
- What's the number?
I think he's still out there.
I didn't see anyone out there.
Is that supposed to make us feel better or worse?
I'm just saying.
Nice job with the fire, brainiac.
- Yeah, you didn't tell me it was gas.
- Moron.
Come on.
Come on.
Is he there?
He's dead.
I know he's dead.
- Hello?
- Hello!
Hello.
My name is Jack.
Look, I'm here with your wife.
- Let me talk to him, please!
- Yeah.
- Bill!
- Ellen!
Thank God.
I was worried sick when I got back to the car and you were gone.
Where are you?
He tried to kill me!
The Nightmare Man!
He's real!
I barely escaped.
Are you all right?
Are you safe?
Yeah, I think so.
Some nice people brought me in.
But he's still out there, in the flesh.
He-
- He got free somehow.
Honey, you've got to calm down.
I'll be right over.
Now let me talk to the guy who called me.
Okay.
I love you.
Get here soon.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Here.
- Hello.
Jack was it?
- Hello.
Look, I think she's gonna be okay, but we should call the police.
- Jack, can I talk to you for a moment?
- Sure.
Can you go into another room, away from my wife?
I don't think we should split up.
If this guy's still out there--
There's nobody out there, Jack.
My wife has some problems, issues.
We were on our way to Devonshine Institute.
You know, the mental facility.
I'm committing her tonight.
Look, I'll be right back, okay?
Can I get you anything?
A glass of water?
Or something stronger?
We got some Brazilian tequila back there.
- Kicks some major ass.
- No, thank you.
I can use one.
But, man, you should see her.
She is bruised and she's cut up.
Oh, God.
She probably did it to herself.
That's why I have to commit her.
Now please, Jack.
You must watch her carefully at all times.
She could be dangerous to herself and-- and perhaps others.
- But...
- What's up?
She said he was chasing her, okay?
Did you see anybody chasing her?
No.
Believe me, Jack, I love my wife...very much.
Let me handle her.
We don't need to involve the police now, do we, Jack?
No.
No, I guess not.
Thank you very much.
Now just tell me where you are.
I'll be right over.
Yeah, hold on a minute.
I'll put Mia on.
It's her place.
She knows the area a lot better than me.
- Unbelievable.
- What's up?
- Well, he needs directions.
- Okay.
And I think it's best if our guest just sticks to water this evening, okay?
- Why?
- He'll explain.
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi.
- Where are you at now?
- Ten miles from the gas station.
Okay, no, you're gonna have to double back.
It's really tricky at night, so keep your eyes open.
Okay.
He's on his way.
Thank you.
Can I see you two downstairs for a moment?
It's important.
It's okay.
He's not inside me anymore.
I'm free.
Come on.
Yeah, it should take you about 40 minutes.
But be careful.
There's a madman out there with a knife according to your wife.
I think he's got my crossbow, too.
Well, that's-- that's just perfect.
Is the psycho out there in the woods or in here with us?
You can't really believe she did that to herself.
Well, in a delusional state, anything's possible.
Come on.
I mean, she's a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
You heard what she said up there.
"He's not inside me anymore?"
Yeah, yeah.
What's that about?
I've been thinking she's a little--
"Inside me?"
You geniuses ever hear of the term "rape?"
Whoa, hey, I'm just telling you what he told me, okay?
And I didn't see anybody else out there.
- Did either of you?
- No.
But what's that old expression?
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.
Yeah, yeah, I got another one for you.
- You can't judge a book by its cover.
- Enough, all right?
Look, arguing amongst ourselves isn't gonna do anybody any good, okay?
Look, we can all see she's been through something horrible tonight.
She's the victim, and I'm sorry, but I'm just not scared of her.
She's terrified and harmless.
Where are my pills?
Jesus Christ.
- What's going on?
- No fucking clue.
She just jumped up screaming.
My pills!
Where are my pills?
Hey, lady, mellow out!
- What are you looking for?
- My medication!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I dropped it in the woods.
Help me find my pills?
Whoa!
Hey, hey!
- Wait, wait.
- You can't go out there.
You don't understand!
Hey, your husband's on his way!
Relax!
And what about that guy out there trying to kill you?
None of you understands.
He got out somehow!
What do you mean "got out?" Out of prison?
An institution?
No, out of me, okay?
Maybe-
- Maybe the pills drove him out.
That's what I'm thinking.
That's why I have to keep taking them or he's gonna be able to get back in!
Look, don't worry, okay?
Nobody's getting in here.
This house is secure, all right?
Not inside the house!
Inside of me!
What?
That's what he wants.
He wants to take over my body, take me over from the inside.
Help me find my pills, or we're all gonna die.
Fine.
Fuckin' A!
About time someone clocked that crazy bitch.
Whoa.
What?
What choice did I have, okay?
She was about to hurt someone...or herself.
Well, good thing they're not married.
You can't call him a wife-beater.
Just help me get her on the couch.
Where do you think you're going?
For a breath of fresh air.
- Downstairs?
- Outside.
- Are you crazy?
- No, but she is.
You all heard her.
"The killer's inside of me."
She's a psycho escaped from a nuthouse.
She didn't escape; she was on her way to being committed.
Same difference!
Whatever, all right?
Right now, I'll feel a whole lot safer out there than in here.
See ya!
Bye!
- What?
- He's your boyfriend.
You deal with him.
Thanks a lot.
I can't believe you hit her.
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
What are we gonna do when she wakes up?
Apologize, I guess?
I wouldn't forgive you.
Yeah, but I wouldn't hit you.
Promise?
Trin, come on.
Baby, look, I love you, okay, with all of my heart.
Our marriage is never gonna be like this.
Even if I was possessed by a demon?
Yeah, spinning head and all.
Good cough.
Feels nice to me.
Jesus, Mia.
You made me drop my cigarette.
Oh, no.
You'll live longer.
Besides, I hate those things.
So does this mean you're on my side now?
There are no sides.
But being out alone in the middle of the woods, murderer or not, not usually the brightest idea.
Anyway, had to get something from the car.
- Why us, huh?
- Why what?
Why didn't you go to someone else's house?
Because we're the only ones up here.
Nobody comes up here before snowfall.
Everything's locked up for the summer.
And what a shame.
They miss all this fun.
It's been all right.
- Come on.
- Oh, jeez!
So, are escaped mental patients a normal occurrence around these parts?
No, my dad was a hunter.
You never when something might turn up that requires a bullet.
Or someone.
Dude, come on, she's sick.
She needs our help.
I actually feel sorry for her husband.
Don't you?
Could you imagine having to spend the rest of your life with someone like that?
I swear to God, if I ever got that way,
I'd rather someone just shoot me just to put me out of my fucking misery.
You could shoot yourself.
Right.
Suicide's a sin.
Don't wanna spend eternity in hell.
A religious tomboy.
Well, with an overactive sex drive.
Let's not forget about that.
Oh, never.
That's my favorite part.
Really?
Your favorite part.
You know, because I thought...
I thought this was your favorite part.
Well, it's been so long since I've seen it,
I-
- I can't remember.
Poor baby.
How about this?
Does this help?
Yeah, yeah.
It's, uh...
It's coming back to me now.
Well...what does a full moon do to you?
God, Mia.
You're killing me here.
Fuck!
Fuck!
God, there's someone out there.
Are you sure?
You don't believe me?
Go ask Ed.
Oh, wait, you can't.
He's dead.
What?
Stay away from the windows.
Is this a joke?
If it is, Ed is not laughing.
The arrow sticking through his mouth is making damn sure of that.
Oh, my God!
Where is he?
What did you see?
I don't know.
I didn't get a good look.
Dressed in black, wearing a mask, demonic devil-faced thing.
So she's not crazy.
I wouldn't say that.
But there's definitely a killer out there.
Who are you calling?
Who I should have called in the first place, the police.
The number's on the fridge.
The station's a good hour and a half away, though.
- Maybe there's a patrol car in the area.
- Yeah, we can always hope.
You can't always get through, though.
Great vacation, Mia.
There is no fucking way in hell I could have predicted this!
If it turns out you set this whole thing up to fuck up my marriage--
Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're the one that needs some psychiatric help because you still don't get it.
The whole fucking world does not revolve around you.
You're one to talk!
- Shut up.
- Fuck you.
- Hello?
- Yes.
Hello.
We have an emergency situation here.
There's a man, a killer, outside of our house.
He was chasing a woman.
He's already killed one of our friends.
- Where's this at?
- At a friend's house.
Mia, what's the address here?
453-
- You know what?
Here, just give me the phone.
Hold on a second.
I'll put the owner on the line.
Watch the windows.
Hey, it's okay, all right?
I'm here.
Hey, what's going on between you two?
- You argue like a couple--
- Nothing!
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
Yeah, it's 43511 Chandler Boulevard.
It's just this whole night-- a nightmare.
No, I don't know who she is.
She's this crazy bitch who showed up screaming.
The gun!
Use the gun!
Yeah, thanks.
Bye.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He might be up on the roof.
Yeah, or gone back down.
An hour?
They really said an hour?
I told you the station's not nearby and I think they had recent cutbacks.
Well, that's okay.
I mean, we have a gun.
He only has a crossbow, right?
And a knife for those at home playing along.
Unless you believe she made up that part, too.
Well, if he tries to get in, then we'll just...
You know?
Do you know how to use that thing?
I've seen films.
Okay?
I mean, come on.
How hard can it be?
You just point and shoot, right?
Give it back to Mia.
When she shoots, she usually connects.
It's true.
Fine.
- Jack?
- Yeah.
What were you gonna ask me before?
- What?
- During Truth or Dare.
My favorite sexual what?
I really don't think now's a good time to continue the game.
- Okay, honey?
- I know.
I'm just curious.
Yeah, me, too.
Position.
Favorite sexual position, okay?
- Bottom.
- Bottom.
Not me, I mean her--
Fucking shit.
- What happened?
- Oh, shit!
- What's going on?
- Stay down.
You were right.
We all saw him.
You saw him?
The nightmare Man?
Look, I'm sorry we didn't believe you, okay?
- Speak for yourself.
- You saw his face?
Yeah.
Devil horns, dark eyes, evil grin, everything you described.
He killed Ed!
What was that?
Sounded like a window breaking.
My guess: not the cat.
- Do you have a cat?
- No.
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.
Oh, shit.
- I'll go look for her.
Stay here.
- Jack, no.
- Jack.
- I'll be all right.
It's all my fault.
What are you doing with that knife?
He's here because of me.
I drove him out and I put all of you in danger.
There's only one thing to do.
Look, just put the knife down, okay?
Yeah, we have a gun.
It's better.
He's still connected to me, and I...
I have to sever the connection.
God, we need some more towels!
- More towels!
- Fuck!
Hurry!
We have to stop the bleeding!
Hey, guys, let's not forget about our other problem here!
- Out of towels!
- Not the problem I'm referring to!
Come on!
Trin, out of the way!
No!
Die, you bastard!
Die!
God!
No!
Trinity!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
I'll kill him for this.
I'll kill him if it's the last--
Jack, no!
Oh, God.
Why-
- Why am I tied up?
Because I think you've caused enough trouble this evening.
Did you find my pills?
So sorry.
Just been a little busy dealing with other things this evening.
Then you have to kill me.
It's the evil.
It's still inside.
I can feel it.
No, lady!
The evil's out there!
You're just one fucked up, unlucky individual.
I'm sorry about your friends.
You have any idea who this psychopath is?
I thought it was the demon, but it's not.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
No, I mean the evil entity, from the mask.
Now I know it never left me.
I can still feel it inside.
What the fuck did he do to you?
The same thing he's gonna do to you if you don't leave very soon.
No.
The police and your husband are on their way, and it's just safer to stay right here.
No, you're wrong.
Look, I'm actually getting a little sick and tired of all your negativity.
I am this close to losing it myself, so either shut the fuck up or talk about something positive, okay?
Positive?
Yeah, positive!
You know, make shit up!
Tell a story that starts with "Once upon a time,"
maybe ends with "happily ever after."
You know, uplifting bullshit from now on, okay?
Got it?
What's your name?
Mia.
What's yours?
Ellen.
Can't really say I'm pleased to meet you, Ellen.
You want a drink?
No, thanks.
Whatever.
More for me.
Shit.
Stay right there.
Is that a joke?
Yes.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck.
What's going on?
False alarm.
What is that?
- Car pulling up.
- The police?
I think it's your husband.
The killer's still out there.
- I know!
- Well, he doesn't.
We have to warn him.
He still thinks this is all in my mind.
If I go out there, we both die.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hello?
Ellen?
Anybody there?
Get your ass in here!
Welcome to our nightmare.
Oh, God!
- Bill!
- Ellen!
Hey, stay away from the windows!
I lost my pills in the woods.
What the hell is going on here?
Everything your wife said is true.
There's a killer outside and we've got the body count to prove it.
Why is my wife tied down?
She tried to kill herself.
What?
I haven't had my pills since we were in the car.
They're wearing off.
I won't be able to control it anymore.
It's okay, honey.
I'll get you some more pills soon.
- When?
- As soon as we get out of here.
I've got some more in the car.
Look, I think everyone needs to calm down.
Why don't you give me this gun?
Don't you think enough people have been hurt already tonight?
I didn't do this and neither did your wife!
Pay attention.
There's someone out there trying to kill us.
And overall, he's been pretty fucking successful!
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
So put down the gun so at least we can talk this thing out.
Fuck that!
This rifle's the only reason why we're still alive.
So what's the plan?
Are you gonna force us to stay here all night?
You can leave whenever you want to.
Personally, I'm staying right here for the police.
The police can't help us now.
What did I say about your negativity?
I need my pills.
Untie me.
Can I at least go out and get her pills?
You can try.
I wouldn't risk it.
Bill, she's right.
There's somebody out there.
Let me go.
Ellen, just wait here.
I'll be back with your pills, and we'll be leaving shortly.
It's your funeral.
Bill, don't go!
We'll go together!
Just hang tight, honey.
This nightmare is almost over.
Either very brave or very stupid.
Take your pick.
He just doesn't understand.
Nobody understands.
Hello?
Somebody out there?
Well, well, well.
You really fucked this one up good, didn't you?
So I made one or two little mistakes!
- I'm sorry!
- Little mistakes?
It looks like the only person you didn't kill is my wife.
She's a lot tougher than I thought.
Everything was going perfectly.
The car ran out of gas exactly where it was supposed to.
I made sure she stayed in the car and her cell phone battery was dead so she couldn't call for any help.
All that you had to do was show up and fucking kill her like we discussed.
Things got a little complicated.
I was playing with her, you know?
A little foreplay before the main event, and she locked me in the fucking trunk!
And you didn't mention anything about any houses nearby in the woods.
Nearby?
It took me 50 minutes to find this place.
Your wife found a shortcut.
And whose fault is that?
All right, yes!
I fucked up, I admit it.
I'm sorry.
I'm fixing it.
Kill one, kill five, it doesn't make a difference to me.
But everyone isn't dead.
There is a girl in there with a rifle.
Yeah.
She's been a pain.
I'll handle her.
You better do it soon.
They said the police are on their way.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Okay, look, since you're here, can you help out?
You know, go in, distract them, grab the gun.
- I'll do the rest.
- This is your mess.
I'm waiting right here until the job is done.
I told them I was looking for her pills.
She dropped them in the woods.
Thanks.
But I'm gonna still keep looking for them until you finish your job.
Fine!
Get the fuck out of here.
Hey!
I'm not paying for any extra bodies.
Moron.
It's too late!
Oh, my God!
Dear God!
It's coming!
Stop it.
Calm down.
You're making too much--
It's too late!
Here it comes!
What the fuck is up with her?
Is this a private party?
Or can anybody join?
No monsters allowed.
Come on.
Come on, what's taking him so long?
Bill.
Christ, Ellen.
What happened?
I'm chilly.
How did you-- I mean, that mess--
Don't talk about that.
Come and make love to me.
Come on, Billy.
Let's make a baby.
What?
Look, honey, you've been through a lot tonight.
You're not yourself.
Mm-hmm, that's very true, but don't let that stop you.
There are four dead people out there.
The police are on their way, honey.
You're hurt.
We're covered in blood.
Hey, I found your pills.
So sweet!
But it looks like you're the one that needs a pill.
Did you just come from your little whore's place, hmm?
Spending more of my money on her?
I should suck you dry!
Is that what the problem with Mr. Limpy is?
What are you babbling about?
Is that why you hired that not-so-nice man to play with me tonight?
You're right, sweetie.
You're not making any sense.
You can't lie to me.
I can see into your soul.
Let me go!
Listen, whatever it was, it's a lie.
So all the affairs?
The private business trips for two?
The secret bank accounts?
All lies?
How do you know about all that?
Because your wife isn't crazy, William.
Never was.
The pills were working.
But tonight, thanks to you,
I was able to come out and play.
Now...
Give us one last kiss.
Leaving?
But I'm not finished.
Shit!
Fuck.
This can't be happening.
You know, I can be a puppet master, too!
You're almost too pathetic to kill.
But then again, it is fun to squash a bug.
Found your heart.
Feels so small.
Perhaps it's broken.
Yep.
Broken.
Now we're even.
One left.
How is this possible?
How is this possible?
Mia...
Where are you going, Mia?
No stars.
The darkness is closing in, isn't it?
What do you want from me?
Leave me alone!
There's something that I need.
This?
This is it?
Is this what you want?
Huh?
This?
Is this what you want?
Then take it!
Then take it!
Take it!
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
Or found the medication sooner.
Yeah, right!
Oh, baby, yeah!
Put it on!
Put it on.
You bitch!
It takes one to know one.
Die, motherfucker!
Die!
Rest in peace.
Let me in.
- I need a new home.
- No!
There's always another way.
No!
Where's the Captain?
He's around back, searching the place.
Captain!
Captain McCormac!
I found one survivor!
What, are you waiting for a medal?
- No, sir.
- Then lead the way.
- Who is he?
- She.
Did she say anything?
Not yet.
Whoa.
And I don't think she's ever going to.
I take it she's not the one.
I don't get it.
She was right here.
Yeah, well, "was" seems to be the operative word here.
Okay, listen to me.
I want you to go back to the house, get the others.
We're gonna comb the entire area, and I want some answers, okay?
This kind of thing does not happen on my watch!
Jesus!
Stay where you are!
Kill me.
Please kill me.
You don't understand.
He killed them.
Now it's inside me.
It's inside me.
Right.
It's inside you.
Got it.
But what is...it?
Evil.
Say that again?
Inside me.
And how are we today?
Fine.
Where are my pills?
You seem to be improving, Mia.
Fine.
Great.
Where are my pills?
And how is that evil inside you doing?
It's under control as long as I have my pills!
Well, we've got some good news for you.
Wonder-- Oh, wonderful.
We decided to take you off your meds for a while.
You can't do that!
They're the only thing that's keeping us safe.
I need my pills!
You don't know what will happen if I don't have my pills!
We're just gonna have to wait and find out, now, aren't we?
No.
Yes, we will.
Hi.
Reminding myself to sign Ritchie's permission slip, bake cupcakes for Parents' Night, new mascara...
Shave things.
Okay, yeah, that's it.
Um, thank you very much.
Oh!
Juice boxes.
God!
Hello?
Hey, Christine, it's me, Richard.
What?
Richard Campbell.
We were married ten years, now divorced.
We have a son, Ritchie.
No, I just, I didn't hear the phone ring.
That surprised me;
I was on the other line.
With yourself?
You don't know that for sure.
Has the cold medicine kicked in?
Like I'm still doing that.
What are you doing?
I'm having anxiety attacks about that damn Parents' Night at Ritchie's school tomorrow night.
Ritchie's room mom asked me to bring cupcakes.
When do I have time to make cupcakes?
So just buy some.
What, are you nuts?
If I show up with store-bought cupcakes, the other moms will call Child Protective Services.
You care too much what those other moms think.
Well, Richard, you have to care what other people think...
I mean, until you're old.
Then you can be like your mother.
Wow.
I didn't see that coming around to my mother.
Nicely done.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
So...
I was thinking, maybe it's time for Ritchie to meet Christine.
Not you, of course.
He's met you, came out of you.
Uh...
I mean, you know, my new Christine girlfriend.
Are you there?
Press the "9" key if you're still awake.
Yeah, I'm here, Richard.
So, what do you think?
I think good!
I think great.
I mean, it's about time.
Haven't those two met yet?
I got to go.
What happened?
You were right.
I'm still on that cold medicine, and it just kicked in.
I'm really fading fast.
So good night.
Damn it!
Damn it!
I'm still here.
Well, uh... have a good night.
Matthew.
Are you up?
Matthew?
!
It's me, it's me.
Hi.
This better not be about American Idol.
I got a real emergency.
Listen...
Richard wants to introduce Ritchie to... his... you know...
You might as well just say it.
New Christine.
Damn it.
Wow, a new, young girlfriend, with the same name as you.
That kind of blows.
Yeah, it so blows.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
No, no.
You know, I-I just took some cold medicine, um, 'cause I have a little... uh, cough.
Boy, that cough's really hanging on.
What is it, like, six years now?
Leave me alone.
I don't make fun of your glaucoma medicine.
Listen, Matthew, Ritchie is not ready to meet his dad's girlfriend.
Listen, I know what you're afraid of.
He's not going to like her better than you.
I mean, I never liked anyone more than our mom, and she made me buy her tampons and cigarettes.
Till about 15 years ago, then she just wanted the cigarettes.
And air-conditioning.
You know, I just don't know how Ritchie's going to react.
So stall.
I-I was dating this girl once and I got the feeling she was going to break up with me, so I just never answered the phone when she called.
For how long?
I think we're still together.
You should go back to bed.
You're going to make your cold worse.
What?
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, I should go take something.
"Three and half cups flour... sifted."
Oh, I have... okay.
Okay, one... two...
Yeah, just a minute!
- Two...
- Christine!
Yeah, come on in.
Come on in.
Four.
Wait.
What?
I hope you preheated that trashcan to 375.
Did you come over here to make fun of my cooking?
Christine's waiting outside.
What?
Why?
She's here to meet Ritchie.
What do you mean, now?
Yeah.
Last night on the phone you said it was okay.
No, no.
I said it was okay at some point, okay?
You know, at some point far, far down the line, you know?
After books have been read and professionals have been consulted.
Okay ?
I didn't know you were talking about this morning, okay?
We can't do it now.
I'm not ready.
You're not ready?
No, I said he's not ready.
You said you.
No, I said "I" as in "him," as in I gave birth to him.
You see, Richard, you know what?
You don't listen.
No.
Christine, it's okay.
Christine loves kids, and I've talked to Ritchie about the fact that I'm dating.
He's okay with it.
Okay, you're right.
I'll be fine.
I'll call him.
Ritchie.
Ritchie.
Ah, you know what?
He's not home.
- Hey, Dad!
- Ah, he came back.
Hi.
Hey, Richard, you shouldn't leave your girlfriend out on the front porch.
Someone took my bike from there last week.
Hi, Christine.
Dad, who's that?
Ritchie, I want you to meet someone.
This is my friend I've told you about.
Hi, Ritchie.
I'm Christine.
Hi, Christine.
Hey, Mom, she has your same name.
We're going to have to work on that.
We'll let Mom keep her name, though.
She's had it longer.
So, we thought we'd go out for pancakes.
Oh, uh, Ritchie doesn't like pancakes.
- We could get eggs.
- I love eggs.
Problem solved.
- So let's go get some eggs.
- Okay.
- Thank you for this.
- Yes, thank you so much.
Okay.
Bye, darling.
Give Mommy a little huggy.
Ooh.
You're such a big boy.
Good-bye, good-bye.
I love you.
Good-bye, darling.
I adore you.
Am I ever coming back?
Yes, of course, you are.
Christine, you're freaking him out.
Okay, sorry, sorry.
Off you go.
Good-bye, darling.
Bye-bye.
Have fun.
I'll just be here making your cupcakes.
One... two...
All right, keep an eye out for Ritchie.
He and Richard are meeting us here tonight.
Oh, did you get any information on how it went with the girlfriend?
Oh, no, I didn't ask.
'Cause you know what I'm not doing?
Blinking?
No, I'm not freaking out, 'cause I've decided to be mature.
They were going to meet sometime, that sometime was today.
They met, it's over.
I have nothing to worry about because I'm his mom.
Well, you really are mature.
Here come those meanie moms I was telling you about.
Let's freeze 'em out.
Freeze 'em out.
Freeze 'em.
Oh, Christine, you made it.
How wonderful.
Oh, yeah, of course I made it.
I wouldn't miss it.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, there.
I'm Marly.
My daughter Ashley's in the same class with Christine's son from her first marriage.
No...
That's, that's my only marriage.
Oh, good.
Lindsay.
Kelsey third, Sammy fourth, Jackson pre-K.
This is my brother.
This is Matthew.
- Oh, brother.
Okay.
- Okay, yeah.
So what do you do, Matthew?
- I'm a producer.
- No, you're not.
- I'm a product tester.
- What?
Stop it.
No, he's my nanny.
He takes care of Ritchie when I'm at the gym.
Oh, good for you.
Work and the gym.
Lots of "me" time.
Yeah.
Yeah, no wonder you can't make it to school events.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I own the gym.
And I'm here at a school event.
And I even made these cupcakes here.
I baked them from scratch.
Baked?
Oh, my goodness.
Yeah.
And well, baking probably helps keep your mind off...
Well, bless your heart.
It's nice meeting you, Matthew.
Hi, Mom!
Hey, Ritchie!
Oh, hi, honey.
I'm so glad to see you.
Gosh, did you have fun?
I had a lot of fun.
Christine's so nice.
We went out for breakfast.
And I had an extra large soda.
Holy moly.
And then we went to the mall and I got to have ice cream for lunch.
- Whoa!
- It was really fun.
Yeah, you said that.
Oh, that's great.
I really, really, really think that's great.
Blink.
And she came with us.
And she what?
Oh, hi.
Oh, Christine, he's such a great kid.
We had so much fun.
Well, has anyone ever had as much fun as you had today?
We brought donuts and they're hot.
Ooh, that sounds good.
Not as good as one of your trashcan cupcakes, though...
Mom, can I have a hot donut?
No, honey.
No donuts.
Sounds like you've been eating sugar all day.
And that can give you a headache.
That's what fun does.
It gives you a headache.
Richard, can I talk to you just for a second?
Yeah.
Why is she here?
And please don't use the word "fun," or I swear to God I'll push you down.
Christine, there was nothing I could do.
We ran out of time.
Are you upset that she's here?
Am I upset that she's here?
You know, I think there might actually be something wrong with you, Richard.
Okay?
It's Parents' Night.
It's for parents.
Chippy Night is later in the month.
Why are you making such a big deal?
Are you still worried about what those moms will think?
No, I'm worried about our son.
This is a new school, and we come in here, me, the working mother, you, the ex-husband, the new girlfriend, the producer brother.
I mean, put a couple of bolts on your neck and we're the freakin' Munsters.
That's ridiculous.
No one's even going to notice that she's here.
You must be Ritchie's mom.
Boy, you look just like him.
Um, hi.
We haven't been introduced.
I'm actually Ritchie's mom.
I'm Christine Campbell.
I'm sorry, I just assumed...
No, no, no, that's such an easy mistake to make.
I mean, it's Parents' Night.
And generally, you don't think of Parents' Night as being open to the community at large.
But since we're all here, I've made these name tags, just to avoid any uncomfortable situations.
I'm going to get a donut.
Oh, okay.
Well, you know what?
These cupcakes are homemade, in case you're interested in that, but you're not.
That's fine.
Mom, is it okay if I show New Christine my artwork?
I'd love to see your artwork, Ritchie.
You know, once, they put my art up in a mall.
- Cool.
- Yeah!
So... bringing the new girlfriend to Parents' Night.
How'd you get pants on over walnuts that big?
What?
I don't see why it's such a big deal.
You don't?
I think there might actually be something wrong with you.
Is that lizard eating one of my cupcakes?
Oh, no.
We tried, but he wouldn't go near it.
Christine, Ritchie is such a great artist.
Yeah, I know that.
- Mom?
- Yeah?
Can I have a donut now?
No.
No more sweets.
I told you we shouldn't have asked her.
Attention, parents!
Can I get you all to gather around here for a few moments?
I want to bring you up to speed about our planned curriculum for the remainder of the year and answer any questions you might have.
The donuts are almost gone.
Please, can I have one?
Ritchie, the answer is no.
All right, come on, let's go and see what Mrs. Belt has to say.
I want to stay here with Christine.
Ritchie, I think you should go with your mom.
I don't want to.
I'd rather stay here with you.
No, no, that's fine.
That's totally okay.
But when somebody asks you "What's the planned curriculum gonna be?"
you're not gonna know.
And I'm not gonna tell you.
Look at this.
The kids are gonna have pen pals in third world countries.
What a sweet idea.
Oh, shut up.
Well, thank you, everyone.
Now please, take a look around our classroom, enjoy some of our yummy desserts.
I think I saw hot donuts over there.
Mrs. Campbell?
A-Are you all right?
Oh, yeah, I'm-I'm fine.
I'm fine, Mrs. Belt.
Well, actually, I'm just a little bit worried about Ritchie.
He just met his dad's girlfriend for the first time, and he might be having a rough time with it.
Are you having a rough time with it, Mrs. Campbell?
Yeah, Mrs. Belt.
I...
I certainly am.
Hey, are you sure you're okay?
Oh, yeah, Matthew, I'm fine.
I mean, Mrs. Belt just seemed like she needed a hug, so...
At least Ritchie seems to like her.
Well, yeah.
Of course he likes her.
She's all... 28 and well rested.
- Yeah, she is cute.
- Am I cute?
Don't do that.
God, it was bad enough when she was New Christine.
Now she's Fun Christine?
I mean, I can't even imagine what that makes me.
Listen, of course he wants to be with her tonight.
She's all sunshine and smiles, and you're all tension and teeth.
Well, what am I supposed to do, I mean, just break all the rules, let him eat sugar all the time, you know, just so he'll like me?
That's what you do with me, and I like you.
All right, all right.
- Hey, Ritchie.
- What?
If you're still interested, you can have a cupcake!
Can I have a donut?
Well, but the cupcakes are homemade-- really-- with love and organic eggs, while the donuts are made with lard by strangers in hairnets.
But if you want a donut, you can have one.
- Have two.
- Really?
Sure.
It'd be fun.
Can I have another one?
Yeah, what the hell?
A little sugar never hurt anyone.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your tummy.
You think you can make it to the bathroom now?
What happened, pal?
Are you okay?
Mom made me eat four donuts.
Christine!
Come on, pal.
Let's go splash some water on your face.
Oh, Christine, hi.
Uh... yeah, I was just...
Do I smell like cigarettes?
It's 'cause... yeah, there was this group of guys smoking out there, and I just walked through, like, a big cloud of it.
And now I feel like I smell...
Okay, I smoke.
Oh, that's okay.
I take cold medicine to go to sleep.
I take sleeping pills and cold medicine.
Uh, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, divorce sucks and I'm a terrible mother, but I'm fine.
You know, it could be worse.
My husband doesn't even show up to these things.
Your kid's got his dad and his uncle, his dad's girlfriend and you.
That's a lot of people showing an interest.
My kid would kill for that.
Are you being nice to me?
You know, mothers have to stick together.
- What are you doing?
- Christine was smoking.
I was looking for you.
Well, you found me.
I don't like that.
Oh, is he okay?
Is he still barfing?
Well, he stopped, and then he started again.
And then he stopped, and then he started again.
And then he stopped, and then he really started.
And I'm not very...
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
Christine.
I know I shouldn't have come tonight.
I just really wanted to spend some time with Ritchie.
I mean, he's such a big part of Richard's life, and you're such a big part of Richard's life.
And... well, sometimes I get a little bit jealous of you.
You're jealous of me?
Yeah.
I think that's why I'm so mean to you.
Well... as long as we're being honest, I should say I accept your apology.
Mommy, I feel sick.
Oh, honey, I'm coming, sweetheart.
I'm coming.
I have to go.
My kid needs his mommy.
But you've been very nice to my son, and Ritchie seems to like you very much.
So that's the important thing.
So I guess I should say...
I accept your apology.
Yeah, I was trying to be fun, but being fun isn't really my job.
My job is to take care of you.
So from now on, I'm gonna stick to that.
I mean, that doesn't mean that we can't have fun sometimes.
We can, just not all the time.
- 'Cause there's a time for fun, and...
- Could you stop talking, please?
Yeah.
Yeah.

Hey, Christine.
It's me, Richard.

- Richard Campbell.
We were married 10 years, now divorced.
We have a son, Ritchie.

L...
I...
I think, good.
I think, great.
I mean, it's about time.
Haven't those two met yet?
[LAUGHS]
- I gotta go.
- What happened?
You were right.
I'm still on that cold medicine and it just kicked in.
I'm really fading fast, so good night.
Damn it.
Damn it.
RICHARD:
I'm still here.
- Oh.
Well, uh, ahem, have a good night.
[WHISPERING] Matthew?
Are you up?
Matthew.
It's me.
It's me.
- Hi.
- This better not be about American Idol.
I got a real emergency.
Listen.
Richard wants to introduce Ritchie to his, you know...
Yeah, you might as well just say it.
New Christine.
Damn it.
Wow.
A new young girlfriend with the same name as you.
That kind of blows.
Yeah, it so blows.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
No, no, you know, I just took some cold medicine, um because I have a little...
[COUGHING] ...uh, cough.
Boy, that cough's really hanging on.
What is it, like six years now?
Hey, leave me alone.
I don't make fun of your glaucoma medicine.
Listen, Matthew, Ritchie is not ready to meet his dad's girlfriend.
I know what you're afraid of and he's not gonna like her better than you.
I never liked anyone more than our mom and she made me buy her tampons and cigarettes.

Go back to bed.
You're gonna make your cold worse.
What?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I should go take something.
"Three and a half cups flour.
Sifted." Sif...
Oh, I have...
Okay.
Set that thing.
Okay.
One.
Two.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Yeah, just a minute.
- Two.
RICHARD:
Christine?
Yeah, come on in, come on in.
Four.
Wait, what?
[GRO ANS]
I hope you preheated that trash can to 375.
Did you come over here to make fun of my cooking?
Christine's waiting outside.
What?
Why?
She's here to meet Ritchie.
- What do you mean?
Now?
- Yeah.
Last night on the phone, you said it was okay.
No, no, no, I said it was okay at some point, okay?
You know, at some point far, far down the line, you know?
After books have been read and professionals have been consulted.
I didn't know you were talking about this morning.
We can't do it now.
I'm not ready.
You're not ready?
No, I said he's not ready.
You said you.
No.
I said I as in him.
As in I gave birth to him.
You see, Richard, you know what?
You don't listen.
No.
Christine, it's okay.
Christine loves kids and I've talked to Ritchie about the fact that I'm dating.
He's okay with it.
[SIGHS]
Okay, you're right.
It'll be fine.
I'll call him.
[SOFTLY] Ritchie?
Ritchie?
Ah.
You know what?
He's not home.
- Hey, Dad.
- Ah.
He came back.
Hi.
You shouldn't leave your girlfriend out on the porch.
Someone took my bike from there last week.
- Hi, Christine.
- Dad, who's that?
Ritchie, I want you to meet someone.
This is my friend I've told you about.
- Hi, Ritchie.
I'm Christine.
- Hi, Christine.
Hey, Mom, she has your same name.
We're gonna have to work on that.
We'll let Mom keep her name though.
She's had it longer.
So we thought we'd go out for pancakes.
Oh, uh, Ritchie doesn't like pancakes.
- We could get eggs.
- I love eggs.
Problem solved.
- So let's go get some eggs.
- Okay.
- Thank you for this.
- Yes.
Thank you so much.
Okay.
Bye, darling.
Give Mommy a little huggy.
Oh.
Oh, such a big boy.
Goodbye, goodbye.
I love you.
Goodbye, darling.
I adore you.
Am I ever coming back?
Yes, of course you are.
- Christine, you're freaking him out.
- Okay.
Sorry, sorry.
Off you go.
Goodbye, darling.
Bye-bye.
Have fun.
I'll just be here, making your cupcakes.
[CHUCKLES]
One.
Two.
Keep an eye out for Ritchie.
He and Richard are meeting us here.
You get any information on how it went with the girlfriend?
Oh, no, I didn't ask.
- Because you know what I'm not doing?
- Blinking?
No.
I'm not freaking out, because I've decided to be mature.
They were gonna meet sometime.
That sometime was today.
They met.
It's over.
I have nothing to worry about, because I'm his mom.
Wow, you really are mature.
Here come those moms I was telling you about.
Freeze them out, freeze them out.
Oh, Christine, you made it.
How wonderful.
Oh, yeah, of course I made it.
I wouldn't miss it.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi there.
- Hey.
- I'm Marly.
My daughter Ashley's in the class with Christine's son from her first marriage.
Oh, no.
- That's...
That's my only marriage.
- Oh, good.
Lindsay, Kelsey third, Sammy fourth, Jackson Pre-K.
This is my brother.
This is Matthew.
- Oh.
Brother.
Okay.
- Okay.
Yeah.
So, what do you do, Matthew?
- Oh, I'm a producer.
- No, you're not.
- I'm a product tester.
- What?
Stop it.
No, he's my nanny.
He takes care of Ritchie when I'm at the gym.
Oh, good for you.
Work and the gym.
Lots of me time.
Yeah.
Yeah, no wonder you can't make it to school events.
Oh, no, no, no.
I own the gym.
And I'm here at a school event.
And I even made these cupcakes here.
I baked them from scratch.
- Baked?
- You made them?
Yeah.
And, well, baking probably helps keep your mind off...
Well, bless your heart.
It's nice meeting you, Matthew.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Ritchie.
Ooh.
Hi, honey.
I'm so glad to see you.
- Gosh, did you have fun?
- I had a lot of fun.
Christine's so nice.
- We went out for breakfast.
- Oh.
- And I had an extra-large soda.
- Holy moly.
And then we went to the mall, and I got to have ice cream for lunch.
- Oh.
- It was really fun.
Yeah, you said that.
Oh, that's great.
I really, really, really think that's great.
[WHISPERS] Blink.
- And she came with us.
- And she what?
Oh, hi.
Oh, Christine, he is such a great kid.
We had so much fun.
Well, has anyone ever had as much fun as you had today?
We brought doughnuts.
- And they're hot.
- Ooh.
That sounds good.
Not as good as one of your trash-can cupcakes.
- Mom, can I have a hot doughnut?
- No, honey.
No doughnuts.
It sounds like you've been eating sugar all day.
And that can give you a headache.
That's what fun does.
It gives you a headache.
- Richard, can I talk to you just for a second?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Why is she here?
And please don't use the word fun, or I swear to God, I'll push you down.
Christine, there was nothing I could do.
We ran out of time.
- Are you upset that she's here?
- Am I upset that she's here?
You know, I think there might actually be something wrong with you, Richard.
Okay?
It's Parents' Night.
It's for parents.
Chippie Night is later in the month.
Why are you making such a big deal?
Are you still worried about those moms?
No.
I'm worried about our son.
This is a new school, and we come in here me, the working mother, you, the ex-husband the new girlfriend, the producer brother.
I mean, put a couple of bolts on your neck and we're the freaking Munsters.
That's ridiculous.
No one's even gonna notice that she's here.
You must be Ritchie's mom.
Boy, you look just like him.
- Just a little bit.
- Um, hi, we haven't been introduced.
I'm actually Ritchie's mom.
- I'm Christine Campbell.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I just assumed.
No, no, no, that's such an easy mistake to make.
I mean, it's Parents' Night.
Generally, you don't think of Parents' Night as being open to the community at large.
But since we're all here, I've made these nametags just to avoid any uncomfortable situations.
I'm going to get a doughnut.
Oh.
Okay, well, you know what?
These cupcakes are homemade in case you're interested in that, but you're not.
That's fine.
Mom, is it okay if I show New Christine my artwork?
I'd love to see your artwork, Ritchie.
Once they put my art up in a mall.
RITCHIE:
Cool.
NEW CHRISTINE:
Yeah.
So bringing the new girlfriend to Parents' Night.
How'd you get pants on over walnuts that big?
What?
I don't see why it's such a big deal.
You know, I think there might actually be something wrong with you.
Oh.
Is that lizard eating one of my cupcakes?
Oh, no.
We tried, but he wouldn't go near it.
Christine, Ritchie is such a great artist.
- Yeah, I know that.
- Mom?
- Yeah?
- Can I have a doughnut now?
No.
No more sweets.
I told you we shouldn't have asked her.
Attention, parents, can I get you all around here for a few moments?
I wanna bring you up to speed about our planned curriculum for the remainder of the year, and answer any questions you might have.
The doughnuts are almost gone.
Please, can I have one?
Ritchie, the answer is no.
All right, come on.
Let's go and see what Mrs. Belt has to say.
I wanna stay here with Christine.
Ritchie, I think you should go with your mom.
I don't want to.
I'd rather stay here with you.
No, no.
That's fine.
That's totally okay.
But when somebody asks you what's the planned curriculum gonna be you're not gonna know, and I'm not gonna tell you.
Look at this.
The kids are gonna have pen pals in Third World countries.
- What a sweet idea.
- Oh, shut up.
Well, thank you, everyone.
Now, please, take a look around our classroom enjoy some of our yummy desserts.
I think I saw hot doughnuts over there.
Mrs. Campbell?
- Are...?
Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine, Mrs. Belt, thank...
Well, actually, I'm just a little bit worried about Ritchie.
He just met his dad's girlfriend for the first time and he might be having a rough time with it.
Are you having a rough time with it, Mrs. Campbell?
Yeah, Mrs. Belt, I...
I certainly am.
Hey, are you sure you're okay?
Oh, yeah, Matthew, I'm fine.
I mean, Mrs. Belt just seemed like she needed a hug so...
- At least Ritchie seems to like her.
- Well, yeah, of course he likes her.
She's all 28 and well-rested.
- Yeah, she is cute.
- Am I cute?
Don't do that.
God, it was bad enough when she was New Christine.
Now she's Fun Christine?
I mean, I can't even imagine what that makes me.
Of course he wants to be with her tonight.
She's all sunshine and smiles and you're all tension and teeth.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I mean, just break all the rules let him eat sugar all the time, you know, just so he'll like me?
That's what you do with me and I like you.
All right.
- Hey, Ritchie.
- What?
If you're still interested, you can have a cupcake.
Heh.
Can I have a doughnut?
Well, but the cupcakes are homemade, really, with love and organic eggs while the doughnuts are made with lard by strangers in hairnets.
[SNIFFS, CHUCKLES]
But if you want a doughnut, you can have one.
- Have two.
- Really?
Sure.
It'll be fun.
- Can I have another one?
- Yeah.
What the hell, a little sugar never hurt anyone.
[RITCHIE COUGHING]
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your tummy.
You think you can make it to the bathroom now?
What happened, pal?
Are you okay?
- Mom made me eat four doughnuts.
- Christine.
Come on, pal.
Let's go splash some water on your face.
Oh.
Christine.
Hi.
Uh, yeah, I was just...
Do I smell like cigarettes?
It's because...
There was this group of guys smoking out there and I just walked through, like, a big cloud of it.
And now I feel like I smell...
Okay, I smoke.
Oh, uh, that's okay.
I take cold medicine to go to sleep.
I take sleeping pills and cold medicine.
Uh, are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, divorce sucks and I'm a terrible mother, but I'm fine.
[CHUCKLES]
You know, it could be worse.
My husband doesn't even show up to these things.
Your kid's got his dad and his uncle, his dad's girlfriend and you.
That's a lot of people showing an interest.
My kid would kill for that.
- Are you being nice to me?
- You know, mothers have to stick together.
- What are you doing?
- Christine was smoking.
- I was looking for you.
- Well, you found me.
I don't like that.
Oh.
Is he okay?
Is he still barfing?
Well, he stopped, and then he started again.
And then he stopped, and then he started again.
Then he stopped, then he really started.
- I'm not very good...
- I got it.
I got it.
Christine?
I know I shouldn't have come tonight.
I just really wanted to spend some time with Ritchie.
He's such a big part of Richard's life and you're such a big part of Richard's life.
Well, sometimes I get a little bit jealous of you.
- You're jealous of me?
- Yeah.
I think that's why I'm so mean to you.
Well...
As long as we're being honest, I should say I accept your apology.
Mommy, I feel sick.
Oh, honey, I'm coming, sweetheart.
I'm coming.
I have to go.
My kid needs his mommy.
But you've been very nice to my son and Ritchie seems to like you very much, so that's the important thing.
So I guess I should say I accept your apology.
Yeah, and I was trying to be fun, but being fun isn't really my job.
My job is to take care of you.
So from now on, I'm gonna stick to that.
That doesn't mean that we can't have fun.
We can, just not all the time, because there's a time for fun...
Could you stop talking, please?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Yeah.

100 DAYS IN FORUM
Frank...
Don't move.
- My bum hurts.
- You're not the only one.
Be quiet.
Sit down!
It feels like I caught a draught.
It's gone into my...
We'll have to swap stools.
What have you got, Mads?
- Take this one, then.
- Will you sit down, please?
- Which stool have you got?
- Sit down now!
- Why am I getting the bad stool?
- Give me that.
Hurry up!
- You're such a jerk sometimes!
- Bloody hell...
- Frank, sit down.
- My bum hurts.
- Hi, Sis.
Good to see you.
- It's been far too long.
- You're all wet.
- Yeah, and cold.
- I made you some breakfast.
- It looks yummy.
- I'm chilled to the bone.
- You were unlucky with the weather.
- Have you talked to Mum?
- Yes.
It's a shame about the dinner.
- But you could come anyway.
- I'd love to.
- Frank.
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?
- I'm just taking some sausage.
You're sniffing the food.
- What's wrong with that?
- You're spreading germs!
I'm getting my gastronomic bearings.
It's an old gourmet trick.
I hope you don't have a buffet at work.
You'd be sniffing everything.
- Did you have a bad trip?
- Frank's bum hurt, so we went home.
Oh.
Well, those hunting stools can't be very comfortable.
Mads has bought these discount stools.
My bum is still sore.
I don't know what's wrong.
I'm going in to work.
- Don't sniff the butter.
- That's enough!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Listen to this line.
"Masturbation is like archery.
You pull back hard and then shoot off!"
Kenny says, "You can't help thinking of Robin Hood and his merry men. "
I say: "So you think of Robin Hood when you do it? " "No, lady Marian!"
That should be in there.
I'm collecting all the gems and putting some notes on.
When we have lots of good ones we'll look for a plot or...
A musical is a bit more loose, you know.
Funny lines and a song...
- Do you know where Claire is?
- I gave her the week off.
She's having an abortion in two days, so I thought...
She can't be shagging now.
We need a secretary!
- I agree.
- We could sack her for that.
We're setting up a musical, so we need a secretary.
She knows that, and yet she's shagging away!
Claire is off for a while, and then she'll be back.
- Is there something I don't know?
- Put two and two together.
Do you want to hang me out?
Yeah, I knocked her up.
Happy now?
- When did you shag her?
- A while ago.
- What's the matter?
- We need a secretary.
I'll hand le it, don't worry.
I can do it.
- You don't want to get it?
- No.
Let the new secretary do it.
Casper and Frank's place.
It's Casper.
Hi, Jon.
What's up?
Really?
Cool, cool.
- Riskær will put up the money.
- Klaus Riskær?
Talk to you later.
Bye.
Alright!
That's the money sorted.
Riskær is going to be the sole investor.
He's going to fund the whole thing.
We'll put it on in Forum.
Let me hug the secretary!
Kenny Nickelmann, the king of sports.
Frank.
Frank...
Ready!
- Are you going to wear that?
- That's what I had in mind, Mia.
I'm going to charm Klaus Riskær, that nice, young man.
- Isn't it a bit over the top?
- He'll see me in character.
It's "Far Away From Las Vegas".
The people want Kenny Nickelmann.
- It'll be super, Frank.
- I can't wait.
You think the clothes are too much?
Okay, I'll change.
Is it here?
There we are.
I'm getting old.
Just getting out of the car is hard these days.
- Hi, Jon.
- Hi.
Thanks for seeing us.
Hi, Casper.
Hello, Frank.
We haven't met before, I think.
Welcome.
Let's go inside and get started.
Hey...
What the hell happened with the leaves?
- They were in a neat pile before.
- That's me.
I'm sorry.
Do me a favour and sweep them up again.
See you, Frank.
- What do you want me to do?
- Sweep them into a pile.
I paid a guy to do it, and now it looks like shit.
- Right there...
- And the horns in the background.
- I'm back.
- Hi, Frank.
Nice of you.
- Are the leaves under control?
- Yes, they are.
- Thanks for seeing us.
- I've been looking forward to it.
- Can I have one?
- Of course.
Help yourself.
I've been looking at your brief, Jon.
It looks excellent.
- "Far Away From Las Vegas" in Forum.
- A show, you know.
We're mixing stand-up and musical.
It's popular and yet new.
You're talking 100 shows in Forum.
The tickets don't sell themselves.
Everyone knows the TV series.
All the actors have said yes already.
My job as investor is to look at the weak spots.
Of course.
After I'd read the material I thought to myself, -
"Can I imagine Frank on stage as a song and dance man in front of thousands of people? "
I went to see The Brown Stop at the Bellevue Theatre.
- This guy Martin Bechmann...
- Brygmann.
He can really sing.
So can The Three Tenors.
You can't compare me to all the great singers.
No, but no chain is stronger than the weakest link, Frank.
I'll have to ask you to pull out.
We'll contact Martin Brygmann.
So you want Brygmann to play Frank's character, Kenny Nickelmann?
Yes.
It's only Frank we're taking out of the show.
You'll earn lots of money from royalties, but you can't go on stage.
There's too much money at stake to have you screeching on stage.
We need some trained people.
See you.
- Martin Brygmann?
- He'll be playing Kenny Nickelmann.
- He'll be what?
- That's what Klaus Riskær wants.
- But it's your character.
- Apparently not.
- They can't do that!
- Otherwise he won't fund the show.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Is it only you who is left out?
- Yes.
All the others are in.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What a stupid day, eh?
My bum is so sore, honey.
I can hardly sit.
I think it's got worse.
- Are you constipated?
- No.
My bum is just hurting.
- Could you have a look at it?
- I'd rather not.
Just a quick look.
To see if something's wrong.
Please...
- Is it right in the hole?
- Yeah, and around it.
- I can't really see anything.
- What do you mean?
I can't see up...
You'll have to spread your buttocks, then.
Alright, well...
- What is it?
- There's something strange there.
- What can you see?
- It just looks strange.
And red.
- You'll have to go to the doctor.
- Yeah, I guess so.
Just go straight through.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi, Susanne.
- Good to see you.
- Yes.
How weird.
It's been a long time.
You look really surprised.
I'm standing in for Teis.
He's on holiday until Monday.
- I hope it's OK with you?
- Yes, yes.
Of course.
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thanks.
What about you?
- I got married two years ago.
- Well, well, well...
You finally found someone who was tidy, eh?
- What about you?
- I have a girlfriend.
Well, let's get back to you.
Why are you here today?
Is something wrong?
- How did it go at the doctor's?
- Fine, except I didn't get examined.
Teis is on holiday, so he had someone stand in for him.
It turned out to be a girl I had a fling with many years ago.
A girl called Susanne.
Mad, isn't it?
- Why didn't you get examined, then?
- I couldn't subject her to that.
- You couldn't?
- No.
She's a nice girl.
I didn't want to stick my sick arse in her face.
So you don't mind doing it to me, but an ex-girlfriend...
It's completely different.
You're my girlfriend.
- There's a huge difference.
- Let's hope it's not cancer, then.
Why do you say that?
- Could I have some more bread?
- Yes.
- How is the bacon coming on?
- It's done.
I talked to Mum the other day, Mads.
She can't understand why she hasn't heard from you.
- Have you been busy or..?
- Yes.
They're pushing me hard.
Right.
Here's the liver paté.
- Help yourself, Mads.
- It looks delicious.
- There's something on there.
- Can I see?
Did you put extra pepper on the liver paté?
- Did you?
- Just to stop him sniffing.
- Did you?
- Just to stop him sniffing.
What's going on?
What were you thinking, putting all that pepper on?
- Come on, Mads.
- It was a joke.
Are you sick?
We'll take you to the hospital.
Excuse me.
Do you have a minute?
Could you look at something for me, please?
I've got a really sore bum, and it's getting worse and worse.
I'm afraid it might be cancer.
I don't know if you can tell...
- How long have you had it for?
- Four days.
Just relax.
What you've got there is a perfectly normal hemorrhoid.
- Hi.
- Hi, Frank.
Hi there.
Hi, Iben.
Hi, Hjortshøj and Jon.
- Have you been here long?
- No.
We've just been chatting.
I brought some papers.
- It's the script, right?
- It's a draft for some scenes.
Excuse me.
- Have you all heard about my part?
- You're too busy, right?
It's complicated.
Let's put it that way.
- Hi.
- Hi, Martin!
- Good to see you.
- You look great.
No comments.
You'll have to call my press officer.
- Hi, Katja and Klaus.
- Nice to see you.
Martin, we were talking about the songs last time.
Could you give us..?
I remember your show at the Bellevue.
Could you give us a little taster?
It's such a scoop to have you here.
I'll just put my glasses on.
Then I look more like Kenny.
That's great!
That's so good.
- It doesn't take much.
- Alright.
"Why have you got a picture of an elephant on your table? "
"It's not just an elephant.
It's Jumbo, the zoo's old male elephant."
"We've got many things in common.
He's proud and pensive..."
"And elephants only mate every second year as well!"
"Yes.
Neither of us has got a girlfriend right now. "
"If I had a trunk I could eat pork scratchings while on my PlayStation".
I'm not talking about physical similarities
Jumbo and I are soul mates
I remember when we first met
So many years ago...
- It's really catchy, Martin.
- Cool!
On a day like today you can't help feeling happy!
- Well, let's look at the...
- I brought the production schedule.
The show opens in February and runs until June.
That's it.
Have you cleared the dates with my secretary?
Are we playing in March?
I'll be in New York the whole month.
I'm doing a road movie with Ole Bornedal.
I'm gone all of March.
Who made this plan?
Jon, didn't you check if people were available?
Casper's secretary was supposed to call Martin.
- Yes, but she's sick.
- Your secretary is sick?
- Casper is secretary this week.
- Casper is secretary?
- So you haven't been told?
- No.
I've heard nothing.
- No one asked if you were free?
- I'm pretty sure I called.
I'd like to apologise, Klaus.
But I'm pretty sure I called.
No one has called me.
I haven't talked to anybody.
It's true!
- Bloody amateurs...
- You haven't even got a secretary!
- It's freezing cold.
- Yeah.
It looks good.
- How about some sausage as well?
- Good idea.
- We'd like some good cheese.
- You've come to the right place.
Why, hello!
How are the hemorrhoids?
- Do you know each other?
- We met at the hospital.
- What were you doing up there?
- I was delivering some cheese.
- I have to see the doctor.
Now!
- Are you feeling bad?
This whole area is infected and oozing pus.
I'll have to cut it off.
- Should I spread his buttocks?
- Yes.
It's a really big boil.
Previously, on Prison Break...
Mr.Kim.
- I'm on it.
Is pursuing her the best use of your time?
It is.
I'll let the president know.
I contact the president directly.
I'll contact her.
No family with patoshik?
Nothing?
Yeah.
Until about four years ago when he killed them all.
Fernando sucre-- he was in las vegas around 2:00.
Out west,just-just like bagwell and franklin.
You know D.B. Cooper?
The money's in utah,and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them fox river boys.
Come on.You got the map?
No.
Somee else does.
Fore i destroyed it,I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information,you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth westmoreland's buried booty.
Get in.-Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.
we have to open up in 15 minutes.
So,it doesn't matter.I dare you.
Boy:
I said...
I said no.
I dare you.Please?
tooele,utah
The ranch is gone,michael.
Well,the five million might not be.
T-bag:
And you gonna find it how?
What,you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't want to hear anything out of your mouth other than what your photographic memory spits out regarding that map.
You watch your tone with me,boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself,boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was,you're worthless to us.
Tweener:
Yo,let me out!
Shut up!
The map!
T-bag:
Uh,uh,okay.
Okay,okay,all right,all right,all right... the ranch... the ranch was in the center of a box-- sheep road on one side,kokosing road perpendicular.
In the center of the property was the ranch house.
And the ranch house was surrounded by trees.
Every tree here is a year old at most.
Except those.
Where is the silo?
In...side the trees.
I want to say on the left,but that m have been a barn.
I remembered the best I could,gents,but I didn't know this place would now be smothered in tract homes, so,you know,I'm sorry that I-I'm not rainman over here.

Lyle sands.
We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire salt lake city field office are at your disposal.
Thank you.
Do you have those files my office requested on the D.B. Cooper case?
We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.If I can get those files immediately,I'd appreciate it.
Hey,sorry,but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the fox river eight?
I am,and they're here in utah to get D.B.Cooper's money, so how abouthose files,lyle?
T-bag:
Silo.
Silo,silo,silo,silo.
This is stupid.
We're going to get made out here.
Ah,shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet,I'd lay it all on the silo being on the left of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time,but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
Something was in their way.
The silo.
Our money should be right there under that garage.
You better be right,boy.
This isn't a high-end subdivision.
They slapped this place up overnight.
The silo's foundation might still be there.
To save money,they probably just laid the concrete for the garage floor right on top of it.
We'll dig straight down.If we hit the foundation,we stay.
But if not,we go.
Let's do it.
Oh,man.
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.
people die all the time,boys.
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.
Let me out!
Well,we got to do something and it's not going to involve hurting anyone.
I got an idea.
First,we're going to need some supplies.
110% do not agree with this.
Everybody's got to pitch in to make this happen.
But back in the big house,the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.
Which is why we're doing it here.
If he gets caught in town,he ain't got a clue where the house is.
Besides,you're the one we can't turn our backs on.
You know,I could have died in there,man.
Well,guess what?
We need you to do something.
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.
Well,we'll talk once you prove we can trust you.
What do I got to do?
I want you to go back to that garden center and get everything on this list.
Then gas up the car.
And we'll meet you right back here in an hour.
All right.
And david... don't screw this up.
This ain't fox river no more,man.
You're looking at the real deal now.
But I want my cut.
I'll be back in an hour.
Let's go.
Mistake.
Big mistake.
northern utah highway 36
no,come on,man
am I glad to see you.
Did you walk here?
Well,no... it'S... it's-it's just a long story,man.
Thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met A...
I met a few roadblocks.
You?
Yeah.
Let me guess... you're going to tooele.
Yep.
Well,it looks like we're going in the same direction.
Hopefully we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey...
I'll make it worth your while.
chicago,illinois fbi field office
Wheeler:
Got some good news,sir.
Got our first tip on patoshik.
Spotted at a burger joint in cedar grove,wisconsin.
Just hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is utah and D.B. Cooper.
Got it.
Lyle.
Therers a guy here listed as having the only D.B. Cooper bill ever found in circulation,harold jenkins.
Yeah,D.B. Bought gas from jenkins with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.
We checked the serial numbers and they matched.
You worked the case?
Fresh out of the academy.
And nobody's cracked it yet.
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.
This jenkins from the gas station,he still alive?
Should be.He was only 18 at the time.
Let's go say hi to him.
chicago,illinois
we're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again.
I'm assuming you're here because you have updates on sara tancredi?
Yes,um,scofield sent her a message through the mail that phone number that was disconnecte you know,to be honest,uh,I was expecting to brief the president.
yeah,about that,uh,right now,as you can imagine,caroline's quite busy.
She's always been busy.
I've been working side-by-side with her for 15 years.
Paul,she's the president of the united states now.
Yes,bill,and I helped put her there.
Well,if you'd like for her to remain in office, you'll take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding lincoln burrows.
I want to talk to her.
You report to me now,and only me.
You're not to try and contact caroline again without my approval,and you don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given; get burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through sara tancredi,by all means,pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away, we'll go about transitioning you back into caroline's life.
Now do you have anything else on sara?
The president has unwavering faith in you.
Wants to make sure you go through the senate approval process with your eyes wide open.
So what are we up against?
Key allies in the house and senate are meyerhoff,barnwell and summerville.
We're counting on them to sway the middle.
But who's the opposition?
Senators blake and killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as vp.
Any indications to why?
Political payback for the president's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
Uh,lance,this is,uh,my father frank.
Pleasure to meet you,sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly,the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor,are you with me?
Absolutely.
no,just chill,dawg.
Listen,once we ro out,we bounce out of town,we'll drop a dime and they will find you.
Just be quiet.Just chill,man.
I'm gonna kill you!
woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
I need sheriff williams.
Yeah,I'll hold.
woody?
when'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Sell 'em on the docks,make a few bucks.
When you were at school,of course.
I was just looking,pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
"I can look at the menu.Doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.
" We get in,we get the money,we get out.
That's it.
No,absolutely.
We're good.
Now it's just up to the kid.
Did you get everything?
Yeah.
Yeah,I got it.
What?
Nothing.It's cool.I handled it.
What?
!
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady.
He got a bad vibe,so he picked up his celly phone,he started to make a call,so I popped him.
You did what?
!
I hit him with a shovel,man!
I didn't know what else to do!
So I just,I tied him up and in put him in the back room with that other country hick.
Here we go.
Here we go.
I came throughyou gimp!
Who was he calling?
The sheriff.
Man,man,I-I don't know,dude.
It just,it set off... did the call go through?
!
Maybe,man... what do you mean,maybe?
Did the call go through?
!
--Yes.No,I don't know!
I don't know,man.
Yo,but I got the gear.
We got to move on this now.
yes?
Sorry to bother you,ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a harold jenkins.
Right here.
Alexander mahone,fbi.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
What are you here for?
D.B.Cooper.
People still want to know about that guy?
Unbelievable.
You worked the gas station in american fork where he filled up.
Yeah.
Normal-looking guy.
Barely said a word.
There were some discrepancies in the statement you filed 30 years ago.
In the report,it's noted that you said he filled up at 7:00 A.M.
But on another occasion,you said it was 7:00 P.M.
Which was it?
Both.
He gassed up twice?
Yeah.
Full tanks both times?
Yeah.
Why?
Woman:
A systems what?
It's a systems diagnostics test.
Footage from our gopher cam picked up exactly where your line was corrupted.
And who corrupted it,you guys?
Maybe.
All I know is my supervisor called and said he wants me and my crew to get over here and fix that problem double-quick,double-time.
So... you're not with the electric company?
No,ma'am.
Now feel free to call your company, but I should tell you,all they'll do is send over some tech,maybe tomorrow if you're lucky.
And he'll spend a whole day trying to find the problem and another day trying to fix it.
But we're here right now and we're ready to turn your juice back on.
My juice?
That's right.
And,uh... and that's your... crew?
Yes,ma'am.
Yeah,D.B.Cooper was driving a 1965 chevy nova.
There's no record on file that cooper even had a car.
But charles westmoreland did,and the car registered to him at the time was a 1965 chevy nova with a 16-gallon gas tank.
Back then,a chevy that size probably got what,eight miles to the gallon?
Now,D.B. Stopped at the station in american fork,gassed up once early that day and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.
Now,why would a guy headed to mexico,which is a straight shot south,drive off the main road for an all-day detour?
The money.-Exactly.
Cooper/westmoreland jumped out of a plane with $5 million.
But westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that magic marker.
From american fork,he couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns, and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them,I want to know about it.
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well,who's gonna pay for this and what about the cleanup and the repair?
Well,the company will cover all costs.
We'll just dig a small trench,once we're finished,we'll re-lay the cement.
It'll look as good as new.
How long is it going to take?
One way or another,we'll be out of here today.
We really need to get started,ma'am.
We wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight,now do we?
Now that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
fine,that's okay,y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette,the noise might be substantial.
You might want take in that tennis game after all.
Oh,no it'S... it's too hot for that now.
Plus,I'm gonna keep an eye on y'all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
How are you?
Good.
All right,where's tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.
We're going to have to cut up the cement.
Yo,we gots company.
What'sp,snowflake?
your timing is flawless.
I don't follow.
Well,let me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh,oh,okay,so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre,I know you trust me.
And you know I'll cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute.Hold on,man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know,I say I want in,you say no.
Then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
Then you decide to play nice and then we're one big,happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time,all right?
Thank you.
Damn,man,you still alive?
And kicking',home boy.
How'd you find us?
Man,if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for uncle sam all over the world... how are you guys doing?
Who are you?
Who are they?
I,uh,I had to call my supervisor.
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority we want to get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Well,jeanette,like I said, there's a lot of work to do, and it's going to be noisy.
Oh,drinks.
I forgot to ask.
We're good.
Thanks.
Yo,man,this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig,
I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you,sister mary francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'll be watching.
CEDAR GROVE.WISCONSIN
billy?
Is that you?
Billy?
Is that you?
Yep.
thank you kindly.
Well now,how did you get out of working?
Union rules.
Uh,one crew member always has to supervise.
I'll check on them in a bit.
- Lemonade?
- Mm.
more ice.
Yeah.
And I like mine with a little...
oops.
But since you'ren the clock,I guess you can'T... join me?
Just two fingers.
been a while.
Yeah?
Whiskey always makes me feel... irascible.
I don't know what that means.
but I do like the sound of it.
Are you wearing angel perfume?
I am.
that reminds you of an ex,I take it.
Yeah.
now,was that good memories... or bad memories?
Both.
Did you talk to maricruz?
I don't want to talk about it.
I got to get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre... down the road,if you're in trouble, europeangoldfinch.Net.
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
What's it called?
Europeangoldfinch.Net.
That's a bird,right?
I got something.
It's the silo's foundation.
Hells,yeah.
Thank you,charles.
We just need to find the edge and dig underneath it.
We'll get the money... hit the back roads.
- Uh,well...
- what's wrong?
We gots to stop in tooele first and gas up the ride.
I thought you already did that.
Man,when the garden center thing happened I just forgot,all right?
I want you to go back into town--
I want you to gas up that car.
Because I'm not driving around with millions of dollars in the trunk,do you understand?
Man,why do I gots to do it...?
Okay.
Okay.
Better check in on our friend.
all the time.
Miss tinsel toes.
billy?
Billy?
Yeah.
I made you a sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
Just like you like.
I'm so glad you came back.
I don't want to say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.
Where is that?
Where's what,sweetheart?
That painting.
Oh,it's holland.
Where I grew up.
You know that.
It's beautiful.
Oh,there's no place better.
It's so peaceful,so... so protected from this crazy world.
- operator
- Hello,operator?
There's an intruder in my house... hello,ma'am?
Ma'am?
Are you there?
Hello,ma'am?
Is anyone there?
Heard you had some activity in tooele today.
A bit.
Don't see how it warrants a visit from the fbi.
A stolen car was dumped just outside of town, belonging to a woman who went to school in st.Louis,am I getting that right?
Yes,sir.
And then here,the owner's girlfriend reports him missing, and then his buddy comes by to check it out and he... goes missing,too.
Yeah,but woody and chet have been known to drop everything and go boar hunting when the opportunity presents itself, and they don't tell their old ladies.
Mr. Mahone,I'll bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.
But woody's dad'll be showing up soon with the keys and... you can look for yourself.
Whoa,whoa.
What are you doing?
!
Mr. Mahone.
Shh.
they're here.
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.
who's there?
It's the police,ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
Can you tell me what happened?
There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter sandwich.
I thought he was billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long...
bath.
And afterwards,I'd just sit there and watch her... do her routine,see.
Rub her lotion on,comb her hair.
Dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh,you're killing me.
she had this spot on her neck right... here.
Gave her goosebumps every time.
and that perfume... my ex.
He was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
He was ram,damn,thank you,sam.
Well,shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went out separate ways.
Do you know... what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
amen to that.
Speaking of.
Could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreter.
You know that,that big guy the strong guy that,that doesn'T... speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would like to have a drink with me after he punches out?
Please.
You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?
Please?
CHICAGO,ILLINOIS
- hey,dad.
- Sarah.I've been trying to reach you.
Uh,yeah.I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
Um...
you in washington?
Yeah,but I'm coming back on the next flight.
I thought you were going to be there for a while.
No,no.
Plans changed,okay?
Sarah,do you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
I want you to stay away from him.
Who,lance?
From my,my group?
Yeah,yeah,that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
And I found out some other things,too.
- What are you talking about?
- You were right.
- Karen?
- I gotta go.
yet,that's right.
yo.
Uh,just one second,sir.
Thank you.
How can I help you?
Just put $40 on three.
I'm sorry.Uh...
what pump was that?
- Three.
- Oh,that one's been sticking.
Okay,well,then,I'll move the car.
Ah,no.Don't-- don't trouble yourself.
I'll have the,uh,mechanic come out and pump it for you.
Hey,we got a customer waiting on three!
All right,I'll be right there.
Yo,look,man,I'm in a hurry,all right?
Oh,he'll be right out.
Just one second.
put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
Drop!
Where are they?
Where...
are... they?
All right,man.
One hand or not,I think hillbilly needs to be up ahead digging.What you think?
Good man.
What the hell are you doing up here?
Uh,I'm sorry,jeannette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
I apologize for barging in.
She's got the hots for the big,strong one.
I'm sorry,jeannette.We're gonna...
we're gonna get back to work now.
No,I think y'all are done, and I think y'all need to leave now.
- We're almost finished.
- No,I think you are finished,okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
sucre,check it out.
Cop.
thank god.
Where are you going?
- ***** - oh,god.
She's our only way out of this,pretty.
Don't say a word,you old whore, or I'll cut your throat out.
Previously on Prison Break.
Mr. Kim.
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.
Is pursuing her the best use of your time?
- It is.
- I'll let the President know.
- I contact the President directly.
- I'll contact her.
No family with Patoshik?
Nothing?
Yeah.
Until about four years ago when he killed them all.
Fernando Sucre-- he was in Las Vegas around 2:00.
Out west, just like Bagwell and Franklin.
You know D.B. Cooper?
The money's in Utah, and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them Fox River boys.
- Come on.
You got the map?
- No.
Someone else does.
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.
- Get in.
- Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.
We have to open up in 15 minutes.
So, it doesn't matter.
I dare you.
- I said no.
- I dare you.
Please?
The ranch is gone, Michael.
Well, the five million might not be.
And you gonna find it how?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't want to hear anything out of your mouth other than that your photographic memory spits out regarding that map.
You watch your tone with me, boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was, you're worthless to us.
- Yo, let me out!
- Shut up!
- The map!
- Uh, uh, okay.
Okay, okay, all right, all right, all right...
The ranch...
The ranch was in the center of a box--
Sheep Road on one side, Kokosing Road perpendicular.
In the center of the property was the ranch house.
And the ranch house was surrounded by trees.
Every tree here is a year old at most.
Except those.
Where is the silo?
In... side the trees.
I want to say on the left, but that may have been a barn.
I remembered the best I could, gents, but I didn't know this place would now be smothered in tract homes, so, you know, I'm sorry that I'm not Rainman over here.
- Mahone.
- Lyle Sands.
We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire Salt Lake City field office are at your disposal.
Thank you.
Do you have those files my office
- requested on the D.B. Cooper case?
- We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.
If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.
Hey, sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River Eight?
I am, and they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money, so how about those files, Lyle?
Silo.
Silo, silo, silo, silo.
This is stupid.
We're going to get made out here.
Ah, shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the left of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time, but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
- Something was in their way.
- The silo.
Our money should be right there under that garage.
You better be right, boy.
This isn't a high-end subdivision.
They slapped this place up overnight.
The silo's foundation might still be there.
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete for the garage floor right on top of it.
We'll dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.
- But if not, we go.
- Let's do it.
- Oh, man.
- Uh-uh.
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.
People die all the time, boys.
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.
Let me out!
Well, we got to do something.
And it's not going to involve hurting anyone.
I got an idea.
First, we're going to need some supplies.
110% do not agree with this.
Everybody's got to pitch in to make this happen.
But back in the big house, the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.
Which is why we're doing it here.
If he gets caught in town, he ain't got a clue where the house is.
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.
Oh.
You know, I could have died in there, man.
Well, guess what?
We need you to do something.
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.
Well, we'll talk once you prove we can trust you.
What do I got to do?
I want you to go back to that Garden Center and get everything on this list.
Then gas up the car.
And we'll meet you right back here in an hour.
- All right.
- And David...
Don't screw this up.
This ain't Fox River no more, man.
You're looking at the real deal now.
But I want my cut.
I'll be back in an hour.
Let's go.
Mistake.
Big mistake.
Come on, man.
Am I glad to see you.
Did you walk here?
Well, no... it's...
it's just a long story, man.
Thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met a...
I met a few roadblocks.
You?
Yeah.
Let me guess...
you're going to Tooele.
Yep.
Well, it looks like we're going in the same direction.
Hopefully we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey...
I'll make it worth your while.
Got some good news, sir.
Got our first tip on Patoshik.
Spotted at a burger joint in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.
Just hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is Utah and D.B. Cooper.
Got it.
Lyle.
There's a guy here listed as having the only
D.B. Cooper bill ever found in circulation, Harold Jenkins.
Yeah, D.B. bought gas from Jenkins with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.
We checked the serial numbers and they matched.
- You worked the case?
- Fresh out of the academy.
And nobody's cracked it yet.
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.
This Jenkins from the gas station, he still alive?
Should be.
He was only 18 at the time.
Let's go say hi to him.
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again.
I'm assuming you're here because you have updates on Sara Tancredi?
Yes, um, Scofield sent her a message through the mail, that phone number that was disconnected.
You know, to be honest, uh,
I was expecting to brief the President.
Yeah, about that, uh, right now, as you can imagine,
- Caroline's quite busy.
- She's always been busy.
I've been working side-by-side with her for 15 years.
Paul, she's the President of the United States now.
Yes, Bill, and I helped put her there.
Well, if you'd like for her to remain in office, you'll take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.
I want to talk to her.
You report to me now, and only me.
You're not to try and contact Caroline again without my approval, and you don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given;
get Burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through Sara Tancredi, by all means, pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away, we'll go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.
Now do you have anything else on Sara?
The President has unwavering faith in you.
Wants to make sure you go through the
Senate approval process with your eyes wide open.
So what are we up against?
Key allies in the House and Senate are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Summerville.
We're counting on them to sway the middle.
But who's the opposition?
Senators Blake and Killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.
Any indications to why?
Political payback for the President's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
- Lance, this is, uh, my father Frank.
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor, are you with me?
Absolutely.
No, just chill, dawg.
Listen, once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'll drop a dime and they will find you.
Just be quiet.
Just chill, man.
Woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
I need Sheriff Williams.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Woody?
When'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Sell 'em on the docks, make a few bucks.
When you were at school, of course.
I was just looking, Pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
"I can look at the menu.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna eat."
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
That's it.
No, absolutely.
We're good.
Now it's just up to the kid.
Did you get everything?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
What?
Nothing.
It's cool.
I handled it.
- Whoa!
- What?
!
Whoa.
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady.
He got a bad vibe, so he picked up his celly phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.
You did what?
!
I hit him with a shovel, man!
I didn't know what else to do!
So I just, I tied him up and in put him in the back room with that other country hick.
- Here we go.
Here we go.
- I came through, you gimp!
- Who was he calling?
- The sheriff.
Man, man, I don't know, dude.
It just, it set off...
- Did the call go through?
!
- Maybe, man...
What do you mean, maybe?
Did the call go through?
!
Yes.
No, I don't know!
I don't know, man.
Yo, but I got the gear.
We got to move on this now.
Yes?
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.
- Right here.
- Alexander Mahone, FBI.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
- What are you here for?
- D.B. Cooper.
People still want to know about that guy?
Unbelievable.
You worked the gas station in American Fork where he filled up.
Yeah.
Normal-looking guy.
Barely said a word.
There were some discrepancies in the statement you filed 30 years ago.
In the report, it's noted that you said he filled up at 7:00 a.m., but on another occasion, you said it was 7:00 p.m.
- Which was it?
- Both.
- He gassed up twice?
- Yeah.
- Full tanks both times?
- Yeah.
Why?
A systems what?
It's a systems diagnostics test.
Footage from our gopher cam picked up exactly where your line was corrupted.
- And who corrupted it, you guys?
- Maybe.
All I know is my supervisor called and said he wants me and my crew to get over here and fix that problem double-quick, double-time.
So... you're not with the electric company?
No, ma'am.
Now feel free to call your company, but I should tell you, all they'll do is send over some tech, maybe tomorrow if you're lucky.
And he'll spend a whole day trying to find the problem and another day trying to fix it.
But we're here right now and we're ready to turn your juice back on.
- My juice?
- That's right.
And, uh... and that's your... crew?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving a 1965 Chevy Nova.
There's no record on file that Cooper even had a car.
But Charles Westmoreland did, and the car registered to him at the time was a 1965 Chevy Nova with a 16-gallon gas tank.
Back then, a Chevy that size probably got what, eight miles to the gallon?
Now, D.B. stopped at the station in American Fork, gassed up once early that day and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico, which is a straight shot south, drive off the main road for an all-day detour?
The money.
Exactly.
Cooper/Westmoreland jumped out of a plane with $5 million.
But Westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that Magic Marker.
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns, and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them, I want to know about it.
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well, who's gonna pay for this and what about the cleanup and the repair?
Well, the company will cover all costs.
We'll just dig a small trench, once we're finished, we'll re-lay the cement.
It'll look as good as new.
How long is it going to take?
One way or another, we'll be out of here today.
We really need to get started, ma'am.
We wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight, now do we?
Now that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
Fine, that's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.
You might want take in that tennis game after all.
Oh, no it's...
it's too hot for that now.
Plus, I'm gonna keep an eye on y'all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
- How are you?
- Good.
All right, where's Tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.
We're going to have to cut up the cement.
Yo, we gots company.
What's up, snowflake?
As always, your timing is flawless.
I don't follow.
Well, let me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh, oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre, I know you trust me.
And you know I'll cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute.
Hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in, you say no.
Then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
Then you decide to play nice and then we're one big, happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
- And kicking', home boy.
- How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for Uncle Sam all over the world...
How are you guys doing?
Who are you?
Who are they?
I, uh, I had to call my supervisor.
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.
We want to get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Well, Jeanette, like I said, there's a lot of work to do, and it's going to be noisy.
- Oh, drinks.
I forgot to ask.
- We're good.
Thanks.
Yo, man, this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig, I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'll be watching.
Billy?
Is that you?
Billy?
Is that you?
Yep.
Oh.
Thank you kindly.
Well now, how did you get out of working?
Union rules.
Uh, one crew member always has to supervise.
I'll check on them in a bit.
- Lemonade?
- Mm.
Hmm...
More ice.
Yeah.
And I like mine with a little...
Oops.
But since you're on the clock, I guess you can't... join me?
Just two fingers.
Been a while.
Yeah?
Whiskey always makes me feel... irascible.
I don't know what that means.
But I do like the sound of it.
Are you wearing Angel perfume?
I am.
Oh, hmm...
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.
Yeah.
Now, was that good memories... or bad memories?
Both.
- Did you talk to Maricruz?
- I don't want to talk about it.
I got to get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre... down the road, if you're in trouble, europeangoldfinch.net.
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
- What's it called?
- Europeangoldfinch.net.
That's a bird, right?
I got something.
It's the silo's foundation.
Hells, yeah.
Thank you, Charles.
We just need to find the edge and dig underneath it.
We'll get the money... hit the back roads.
- Uh, well...
- What's wrong?
We gots to stop in Tooele first and gas up the ride.
I thought you already did that.
Man, when the garden center thing happened I just forgot, all right?
I want you to go back into town--
I want you to gas up that car.
Because I'm not driving around with millions of dollars in the trunk, do you understand?
Man, why do I gots to do it...?
Okay.
Okay.
Better check in on our friend.
Miss Tinsel Toes.
Billy?
Billy?
Yeah.
I made you a sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
Just like you like.
I'm so glad you came back.
I don't want to say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.
Where is that?
Where's what, sweetheart?
That painting.
Oh, it's Holland.
Where I grew up.
You know that.
It's beautiful.
Oh, there's no place better.
It's so peaceful, so...
so protected from this crazy world.
Hello, Operator?
There's an intruder in my house...
Hello, ma'am?
Ma'am?
Are you there?
Is anyone there?
Heard you had some activity in Tooele today.
A bit.
Don't see how it warrants a visit from the FBI.
A stolen car was dumped just outside of town, belonging to a woman who went to school in St. Louis, am I getting that right?
Yes, sir.
And then here, the owner's girlfriend reports him missing, and then his buddy comes by to check it out and he... goes missing, too.
Yeah, but Woody and Chet have been known to drop everything and go boar hunting when the opportunity presents itself, and they don't tell their old ladies.
Mr. Mahone, I'll bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.
But Woody's dad'll be showing up soon with the keys and... you can look for yourself.
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
!
Mr. Mahone.
Shh.
They're here.
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.
Who's there?
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
Can you tell me what happened?
There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long... bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her... do her routine, see.
Rub her lotion on, comb her hair.
Dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh, you're killing me.
She had this spot on her neck right... here.
Gave her goosebumps every time.
And that perfume...
My ex.
He was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
He was ram, damn, thank you, Sam.
Well, shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went out separate ways.
Do you know... what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
Amen to that.
Speaking of.
Could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreter.
You know that, that big guy the strong guy that, that doesn't... speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would like to have a drink with me after he punches out?
Please.
You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?
Please?
Hey, Dad.
Sarah.
I've been trying to reach you.
Uh, yeah.
I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
Um...
You in Washington?
Yeah, but I'm coming back on the next flight.
I thought you were going to be there for a while.
No, no.
Plans changed, okay?
Sarah, do you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
- I want you to stay away from him.
- Who, Lance?
From my, my group?
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
And I found out some other things, too.
- What are you talking about?
- You were right.
- Sarah?
- I gotta go.
Yo.
Uh, just one second, sir.
Thank you.
How can I help you?
Just put $40 on three.
I'm sorry.
Uh...
What pump was that?
Three.
Oh, that one's been sticking.
Okay, well, then, I'll move the car.
Ah, no.
Don't-- Don't trouble yourself.
I'll have the, uh, mechanic come out and pump it for you.
Hey, we got a customer waiting on three!
Yo, look, man, I'm in a hurry, all right?
Oh, he'll be right out.
Just one second.
Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
Drop!
Where are they?
Where... are... they?
All right, man.
One hand or not, I think Hillbilly needs to be up ahead digging.
What you think?
Good man.
Oh.
What the hell are you doing up here?
Uh, I'm sorry, Jeannette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
Don't bother.
She's got the hots for the big, strong one.
I'm sorry, Jeannette.
We're gonna... we're gonna get back to work now.
No, I think y'all are done, and I think y'all need to leave now.
We're almost finished.
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
Sucre, check it out.
Cop.
Thank God.
Oh, let her go, T-Bag.
She's our only way out of this, pretty.
Don't say a word, you old whore, or I'll cut your throat out.
Previously on Prison Break:
Mr. Kim.
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.
-Pursuing her the best use of your time?
-It is.
-I'll let the president know.
-I contact the president.
I'll contact her.
No family with Patoshik?
-Nothing?
-Yeah.
Until about four years ago when he killed them.
Fernando Sucre.
He was in Las Vegas around 2.
Out west.
Just like Bagwell and Franklin.
You know D.B. Cooper?
The money's in Utah and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them Fox River boys.
-Come on, you got the map?
-No.
Someone else does.
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.
-Get in.
-Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.
We have to open up in 15 minutes.
-So?
That doesn't matter.
I dare you.
-I said no.
I dare you, please.
The ranch is gone, Michael.
Well, the five million might not be.
And you're gonna find it how?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't wanna hear anything from you other than what your photographic memory spits out regarding that map!
You watch your tone with me, boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was you're worthless to us.
-Yo, fools, let me out.
-Shut up.
-The map!
-Okay, okay.
All right, all right, all right.
Let me out, boss.
The ranch was in the center of a box.
Sheep Road on one side, Kokosing Road perpendicular.
In the center of the property was the ranch house and the ranch house was surrounded by trees.
Let me out.
Every tree here is a year old at most except those.
Where's the silo?
Inside the trees, I wanna say on the left but that may have been a barn.
I remembered the best I could, gents, but I didn't know this place would now be smothered in tract homes.
So, you know, I'm sorry that I'm not Rain Man over here.
-Alex Mahone.
How are you?
-Lyle Sands.
We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire Salt Lake City Field Office are at your disposal.
Thank you.
Do you have the files my office requested on D.B. Cooper?
We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.
If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.
Sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River 8?
I am.
And they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money.
So how about those files, Lyle?
-Silo.
Silo, silo.
-This is stupid.
-We're gonna get made out here.
-All right, shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the left of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
Something was in their way.
The silo.
Our money should be right there, under that garage.
You better be right, boy.
This isn't a high-end subdivision.
They slapped this place up overnight.
The silo's foundations might still be there.
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete for the garage floor right on top of it.
We'll dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.
If not, we go.
Let's do it.
Oh, man.
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.
People die all the time, boys.
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.
-Let me out of here, man.
Come on, guys.
-Well, we gotta do something.
And it's not gonna involve hurting anyone.
I got an idea.
First, we're gonna need some supplies.
A hundred and 10 percent, I do not agree with this.
Everybody's gotta pitch in to make this happen.
But back in the big house, the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.
Which is why we're doing it here.
If he gets caught in town, he ain't got a clue where the house is.
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.
I could have died in there, man.
Well, guess what.
I need you to do something.
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.
Well, we'll talk once you prove we can trust you.
What do I gotta do?
I want you to go back to that garden center and get everything on this list.
And gas up the car.
And we'll meet you right back here in an hour.
-All right.
-And, David don't screw this up.
This ain't Fox River no more, man.
You're looking at the real deal now.
But I want my cut.
Be back in an hour.
Let's go.
Mistake.
Big mistake.
Oh, come on, now.
Am I glad to see you.
You walk here?
No, it's just a long story, man.
I thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met a few roadblocks.
And you?
Yeah.
Well, let me guess.
You're going to Tooele.
Yeah.
Well, looks like we're going the same direction.
Hopefully, we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey, look I'll make it worth your while.
We've got some good news, sir.
We got our first tip on Patoshik.
Spotted at a burger joint in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.
Hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is Utah and D.B. Cooper.
Got it.
Lyle.
There's a guy listed as having the only D.B. Cooper bill ever found.
-Harold Jenkins.
-Yeah.
D.B. bought gas from Jenkins with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.
We checked the serial numbers and they matched.
You worked the case?
Fresh out of the academy and nobody's cracked it yet.
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.
Jenkins from the gas station, he still alive?
Should be.
He was only 18 at the time.
Well, let's go say hi to him.
We're sorry, that call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again.
Do you have updates on Sara Tancredi?
I assume that's why you're here.
Yes.
Scofield sent her a message through the mail.
A phone number that was disconnected.
You know, to be honest I was expecting to brief the president.
Yeah, about that.
Right now, as you can imagine, Caroline's quite busy.
She's always been busy.
I've been working with her for 15 years.
Paul she's the president of the Unites States now.
Yes, Bill and I helped to put her there.
Well, if you'd like for her to remain in office you'll take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.
I wanna talk to her.
You report to me now, and only me.
Don't try and contact Caroline again without my approval and don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given.
Get Burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through Sara Tancredi, by all means pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away we'll go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.
Now, do you have anything else on Sara?
The president has unwavering faith in you.
She wants you to go through Senate approval with your eyes wide open.
-So what are we up against?
-Key allies in the House and Senate are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Sommerville.
-Counting on them to sway the middle.
-Who's the opposition?
Senators Blake and Killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.
Any indication as to why?
Political payback for the president's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
-Dad.
Lance, this is my father, Frank.
-Pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor, are you with me?
Absolutely.
Yo, just chill, dog.
Listen once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'll drop a dime and they'll find you.
Just be quiet.
Just chill, man.
Woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
I need Sheriff Williams.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Woody?
Where'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Then I'd sell them on the docks, make a few bucks.
You were in school, of course.
I was just looking, pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
I can look at the menu, doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
-That's it.
-No, absolutely.
We're good.
Now, it's just up to the kid.
-Did you get everything?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
-What?
-Nothing.
It's cool.
I handled it.
-What?
-Whoa.
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady, he got a bad vibe so he picked up his cellie phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.
-What?
!
-I hit him with the shovel, man.
I didn't know what else to do.
I tied him up and I put him in the back room with that other country hick.
-Here we go.
Here we go.
-I came through, you gimp.
-Who was he calling?
-The sheriff.
Man, I don't know, dude.
It just set off so quick.
-Did the call go through?
-Maybe, man.
I don't know.
Maybe?
Did the call go through?
Yes, l-
- No, I don't know.
I don't know, man.
Yo, but I got the gear.
We gotta move on this now.
Yes?
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.
Right here.
Alexander Mahone, FBI.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
-What are you here for?
-D.B. Cooper.

Wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight, now, would we?
Well, that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touché.
Fine.
It's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.
You might wanna take in that tennis game after all.
Oh, no, it's too hot for that now.
Plus, I gotta keep an eye on you all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
-How are you?
-Good.
All right, where's Tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.
-We're gonna have to cut up the cement.
-Yo, we gots company.
What's up, snowflake?
Well, as always, your timing is flawless.
-I don't follow.
-Well, let me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre, I know you trust me and you know I'll cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute, hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in, you say no then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
And then you decide to play nice and then we're one big happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
And kicking, homeboy.
How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for Uncle Sam all over the world--
How are you guys doing?
Who are you?
Who are they?
I had to call my supervisor.
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.
They want to get this done as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
Well, Jeanette, like I said, there's a lot of work to do and it's gonna be noisy.
Oh, drinks.
I forgot to ask.
We're good.
Thanks.
Yo, man, this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig, I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'll be watching.
Billy?
Is that you?
Billy, is that you?
Yeah.
Thank you kindly.
Well, now, how did you get out of working?
Union rules.
One crew member always has to supervise.
I'll check on them in a bit.
Lemonade?
Little more ice?
Yeah.
And I like mine with a little oomph.
But since you're on the clock I guess you can't join me?
Just two fingers.
All right.
It's been a while.
Yeah?
Whiskey always makes me feel irascible.
I don't know what that means.
But I do like the sound of it.
Are you wearing Angel perfume?
I am.
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.
Yeah.
Now, is that good memories or bad memories?
Both.
Did you talk to Maricruz?
I don't wanna talk about her.
I gotta get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre down the road, if you're in trouble, Europeangoldfinch.net.
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
-What's it called?
-Europeangoldfinch.net.
That's a bird, right?
I got something.
-It's the silo's foundation.
-Hells, yeah.
Thank you, Charles.
We just need to find the edge and dig underneath it.
We'll get the money, hit the back roads.
What's wrong?
We got to stop in Tooele first and gas up our ride.
I thought you already did that.
Man, when the garden center thing happened, I just forgot, all right?
I want you to go back into town.
I want you to gas up that car because I'm not driving around with millions of dollars in the trunk.
-Do you understand?
-Man, why do I got to do it?
Okay.
Okay.
I better check in on our friend.
You got it all the time.
Miss Tinsel toes.
Billy?
Billy?
Yeah?
I made you a sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
Just like you like.
I'm so glad you came back.
I don't wanna say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.
Where is that?
Where's what, sweetheart?
That painting.
It's Holland, where I grew up.
You know that.
-It's beautiful.
-Oh, there's no place better.
It's so peaceful so protected from this crazy world.
-Operator.
-Hello, operator.
There's an intruder in my house.
Hello, ma'am?
Ma'am, are you there?
Is anyone there?
Heard you had some activity in Tooele today.
A bit.
Don't see how it warrants a visit from the FBI.
A stolen car was dumped outside of town belonging to a woman from St. Louis.
-Am I getting that right?
-Yes, sir.
And then here, the owner's girlfriend reports him missing and then his buddy comes by to check it out and he goes missing too.
Woody and Chet have been known to drop everything and go boar hunting when the opportunity arises.
And they don't tell their old ladies.
Mr. Mahone, I'll bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.
His dad will be showing up soon with the keys and you can look for yourself.
Whoa, what are you doing?
Mr. Mahone.
They're here.
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.
Who's there?
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
-Can you tell me what happened?
-There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her do her routine.
She'd rub her lotion on, comb her hair dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh, you're killing me.
She had this spot on her neck right here.
Gave her goose bumps every time.
And that perfume....
My ex, he was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
It was wham, bam, thank you, Sam.
Well, shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went our separate ways.
Do you know what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
Amen to that.
Speaking of could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only, you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreeter.
You know that big guy?
The strong guy that doesn't speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would like to have a drink with me after he punches out?
Please.
You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?
Please.
-Hey, Dad.
-Sara, I've been trying to reach you.
Uh, yeah, I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
-You in Washington?
-Yeah, I'm coming back on the next flight.
-I thought you're gonna be there for a while.
-No, plan's changed.
Sara, you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
I want you to stay away from him.
Who, Lance from my group?
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
I found out some other things too.
-What are you talking about?
-You were right.
-Sara?
-I gotta go.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
-Yo.
-Just one second, sir.
Thank you.
-Can I help you?
-Just put 40 on three.
I'm sorry, what pump was that?
-Three.
-That one's been sticking.
-Okay.
Then, I'll move the car.
-No.
No, don't trouble yourself.
I'll have the mechanic come out and pump it for you.
I've got a customer waiting on three.
-All right, I'll be right there.
-I'm in a hurry, all right?
Oh, he'll be right out.
Just one second.
Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
-Oh, God.
-Drop!
Where are they?
What?
What?
Where are they?
Hey, man, one hand or not, I think hillbilly needs to be up in here digging.
What you think?
Good man.
What the hell are you doing up here?
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
-I apologize for barging in.
-Don't bother.
She's got the hots for the big strong one.
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
We're gonna get back to work now.
No, I think y'all are done.
And I think y'all need to leave now.
We're almost finished.
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
Sucre, check it out.
Cop.
Oh, thank God.
-Where you going?
-T-Bag, let her go!
Oh, God.
She's our only way out of this, pretty.
Don't say a word, you old whore, or I'm gonna cut your throat out.
Previously on Prison Break:
Mr. Kim.
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.
-Pursuing her the best use of your time?
-It is.
-I'II let the president know.
-I contact the president.
I'II contact her.
No family with Patoshik?
-Nothing?
- Yeah.
Until about four years ago when he killed them.
Fernando Sucre.
He was in Las Vegas around 2.
Out west.
Just like Bagwell and Franklin.
You know D.B. Cooper?
The money's in Utah and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them Fox River boys.
-Come on, you got the map?
-No.
Someone else does.
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.
-Get in.
-Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.
We have to open up in 1 5 minutes.
-So?
That doesn't matter.
I dare you.
-I said no.
I dare you, please.
The ranch is gone, Michael.
Well, the five million might not be.
And you're gonna find it how?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't wanna hear anything from you other than what your photographic memory spits out regarding that map!
You watch your tone with me, boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was you're worthless to us.
-Yo, fools, Iet me out.
-Shut up.
-The map!
-Okay, okay.
AII right, all right, all right.
Let me out, boss.
The ranch was in the center of a box.
Sheep Road on one side, Kokosing Road perpendicular.
In the center of the property was the ranch house and the ranch house was surrounded by trees.
Let me out.
Every tree here is a year old at most except those.
Where's the silo?
Inside the trees, I wanna say on the Ieft but that may have been a barn.
I remembered the best I could, gents, but I didn't know this place would now be smothered in tract homes.
So, you know, I'm sorry that I'm not Rain Man over here.
-alex Mahone.
How are you?
-Lyle Sands.
We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire Salt Lake City Field Office are at your disposal.
Thank you.
Do you have the files my office requested on D.B. Cooper?
We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.
If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.
Sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River 8?
I am.
And they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money.
So how about those files, Lyle?
-Silo.
Silo, silo.
-This is stupid.
-We're gonna get made out here.
-AII right, shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the Ieft of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
Something was in their way.
The silo.
Our money should be right there, under that garage.
You better be right, boy.
This isn't a high-end subdivision.
They slapped this place up overnight.
The silo's foundations might still be there.
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete for the garage floor right on top of it.
We'II dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.
If not, we go.
Let's do it.
Oh, man.
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.
Season 2 Episode 6 Subdivision
People die all the time, boys.
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.
-Let me out of here, man.
Come on, guys.
-Well, we gotta do something.
And it's not gonna involve hurting anyone.
I got an idea.
First, we're gonna need some supplies.
A hundred and 1 0 percent, I do not agree with this.
Everybody's gotta pitch in to make this happen.
But back in the big house, the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.
Which is why we're doing it here.
If he gets caught in town, he ain't got a clue where the house is.
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.
I could have died in there, man.
Well, guess what.
I need you to do something.
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.
Well, we'II talk once you prove we can trust you.
What do I gotta do?
I want you to go back to that garden center and get everything on this list.
And gas up the car.
And we'II meet you right back here in an hour.
-AII right.
-And, David don't screw this up.
This ain't Fox River no more, man.
You're looking at the real deal now.
But I want my cut.
Be back in an hour.
Let's go.
Mistake.
Big mistake.
Oh, come on, now.
Am I glad to see you.
You walk here?
No, it's just a Iong story, man.
I thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met a few roadblocks.
And you?
Yeah.
Well, Iet me guess.
You're going to Tooele.
Yeah.
Well, looks like we're going the same direction.
Hopefully, we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey, look I'II make it worth your while.
We've got some good news, sir.
We got our first tip on Patoshik.
Spotted at a burger joint in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.
Hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is Utah and D.B. Cooper.
Got it.
Lyle.
There's a guy listed as having the only D.B. Cooper bill ever found.
-Harold Jenkins.
-Yeah.
D.B. bought gas from Jenkins with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.
We checked the serial numbers and they matched.
You worked the case?
Fresh out of the academy and nobody's cracked it yet.
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.
Jenkins from the gas station, he still alive?
Should be.
He was only 1 8 at the time.
Well, Iet's go say hi to him.
We're sorry, that call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again.
Do you have updates on Sara Tancredi?
I assume that's why you're here.
Yes.
Scofield sent her a message through the mail.
A phone number that was disconnected.
You know, to be honest I was expecting to brief the president.
Yeah, about that.
Right now, as you can imagine, Caroline's quite busy.
She's always been busy.
I've been working with her for 1 5 years.
Paul she's the president of the Unites States now.
Yes, Bill and I helped to put her there.
Well, if you'd Iike for her to remain in office you'II take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.
I wanna talk to her.
You report to me now, and only me.
Don't try and contact Caroline again without my approval and don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given.
Get Burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through Sara Tancredi, by all means pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away we'II go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.
Now, do you have anything else on Sara?
The president has unwavering faith in you.
She wants you to go through Senate approval with your eyes wide open.
-So what are we up against?
-Key allies in the House and Senate are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Sommerville.
-Counting on them to sway the middle.
-Who's the opposition?
Senators blake and Killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.
Any indication as to why?
Political payback for the president's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
-Dad.
Lance, this is my father, Frank.
-pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor, are you with me?
Absolutely.
Yo, just chill, dog.
Listen once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'II drop a dime and they'II find you.
Just be quiet.
Just chill, man.
Woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
I need Sheriff Williams.
Yeah, I'II hold.
Woody?
Where'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Then I'd sell them on the docks, make a few bucks.
You were in school, of course.
I was just looking, pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
I can look at the menu, doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
-That's it.
-No, absolutely.
We're good.
Now, it's just up to the kid.
-Did you get everything?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
-What?
-Nothing.
It's cool.
I handled it.
-What?
-Whoa.
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady, he got a bad vibe so he picked up his cellie phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.
-What?
!
-I hit him with the shovel, man.
I didn't know what else to do.
I tied him up and I put him in the back room with that other country hick.
-Here we go.
Here we go.
-I came through, you gimp.
-Who was he calling?
-The sheriff.
Man, I don't know, dude.
It just set off so quick.
-Did the call go through?
-Maybe, man.
I don't know.
Maybe?
Did the call go through?
Yes, I-
- No, I don't know.
I don't know, man.
Yo, but I got the gear.
We gotta move on this now.
Yes?
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.
Right here.
alexander Mahone, FBI.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
-What are you here for?
-D.B. Cooper.
People still wanna know about that guy?
Unbelievable.
You worked the gas station in American Fork where he filled up.
Yeah.
Normal-Iooking guy.
Barely said a word.
There were some discrepancies in the statement you filed 30 years ago.
In the report, it's noted that you said he filled up at 7 a.m but on another occasion, you said it was 7 p.m.
-Which was it?
-Both.
He gassed up twice?
Yeah.
Full tanks both times?
Yeah.
Why?
A systems what?
It's a systems diagnostics test.
Footage from our gopher cam picked up exactly where your line was corrupted.
And who corrupted it?
-You guys?
-Maybe.
AII I know is my supervisor called and said he wants me and my crew to get over here and fix that problem double quick, double time.
-So you're not with the electric company?
-No, ma'am.
Now, feel free to call your company.
But I tell you, all they'II do is send over some tech.
Maybe tomorrow, if you're lucky.
And he'II spend a whole day trying to find the problem and another day trying to fix it.
But we're here right now.
And we're ready to turn your juice back on.
My juice?
That's right.
And that's your crew?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving a 1 965 Chevy Nova.
There's no record on file that Cooper even had a car.
But Charles Westmoreland did and the car registered to him at the time was a 1 965 Chevy Nova with a 1 6-gallon gas tank.
Back then, a Chevy that size got approximately eight miles to the gallon.
D.B. stopped at the station in American Fork and gassed up once early that day and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico, which is a straight shot south drive off the main road for an all-day detour?
-The money.
-Exactly.
Cooper, Westmoreland, jumped out of a plane with $5 million.
But Westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that magic marker.
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them, I wanna know about it.
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well, who's gonna pay for this and what about the cleanup and the repair?
Well, the company will cover all costs.
We'II just dig a small trench.
Once we're finished, we'II re-Iay the cement.
It'II look as good as new.
How long is it gonna take?
One way or another, we'II be out of here today.
Really need to get started, ma'am.
Wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight, now, would we?
Well, that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
Fine.
It's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.
You might wanna take in that tennis game after all.
Oh, no, it's too hot for that now.
plus, I gotta keep an eye on you all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
-How are you?
-Good.
AII right, where's Tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.
-We're gonna have to cut up the cement.
-Yo, we gots company.
What's up, snowflake?
Well, as always, your timing is flawless.
-I don't follow.
-Well, Iet me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre, I know you trust me and you know I'II cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute, hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in, you say no then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
And then you decide to play nice and then we're one big happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
And kicking, homeboy.
How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for Uncle Sam all over the world--

We're good.
Thanks.
Yo, man, this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig, I'II volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'II be watching.
Billy?
Is that you?
Billy, is that you?
Yeah.

Well, now, how did you get out of working?

I made you a sandwich.

I'm so glad you came back.
I don't wanna say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.

It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
-Can you tell me what happened?
-There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her do her routine.
She'd rub her lotion on, comb her hair dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh, you're killing me.
She had this spot on her neck right here.
Gave her goose bumps every time.
And that perfume....
My ex, he was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
It was wham, bam, thank you, Sam.
Well, shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went our separate ways.
Do you know what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
Amen to that.
Speaking of could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only, you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreeter.
You know that big guy?
The strong guy that doesn't speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would Iike to have a drink with me after he punches out?
please.
You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?
please.
-Hey, Dad.
-Sara, I've been trying to reach you.
Uh, yeah, I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
-You in Washington?
-Yeah, I'm coming back on the next flight.
-I thought you're gonna be there for a while.
-No, plan's changed.
Sara, you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
I want you to stay away from him.
Who, Lance from my group?
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
I found out some other things too.
-What are you talking about?
-You were right.
-Sara?
-I gotta go.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
-Yo.
-Just one second, sir.
Thank you.
-Can I help you?
-Just put 40 on three.
I'm sorry, what pump was that?
-Three.
-That one's been sticking.
-Okay.
Then, I'II move the car.
-No.
No, don't trouble yourself.
I'II have the mechanic come out and pump it for you.
I've got a customer waiting on three.
-AII right, I'II be right there.
-I'm in a hurry, all right?
Oh, he'II be right out.
Just one second.
Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
-Oh, God.
-Drop!
Where are they?
What?
What?
Where are they?
Hey, man, one hand or not, I think hillbilly needs to be up in here digging.
What you think?
Good man.
What the hell are you doing up here?
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
-I apologize for barging in.
-Don't bother.
She's got the hots for the big strong one.
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
We're gonna get back to work now.
No, I think y'all are done.
And I think y'all need to leave now.
We're almost finished.
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
Sucre, check it out.
Cop.
Oh, thank God.
-Where you going?
-T-Bag, Iet her go!
Oh, God.
She's our only way out of this, pretty.
Don't say a word, you old whore, or I'm gonna cut your throat out.
Previously on Prison Break:
Mr. Kim.
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.
-Pursuing her the best use of your time?
-It is.
-I'II let the president know.
-I contact the president.
I'II contact her.
No family with Patoshik?
-Nothing?
- Yeah.
Until about four years ago when he killed them.
Fernando Sucre.
He was in Las Vegas around 2.
Out west.
Just like Bagwell and Franklin.
You know D.B. Cooper?
The money's in Utah and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them Fox River boys.
-Come on, you got the map?
-No.
Someone else does.
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.
-Get in.
-Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.
We have to open up in 1 5 minutes.
-So?
That doesn't matter.
I dare you.
-I said no.
I dare you, please.
The ranch is gone, Michael.
Well, the five million might not be.
And you're gonna find it how?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't wanna hear anything from you other than what your photographic memory spits out regarding that map!
You watch your tone with me, boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was you're worthless to us.
-Yo, fools, Iet me out.
-Shut up.
-The map!
-Okay, okay.
AII right, all right, all right.
Let me out, boss.
The ranch was in the center of a box.
Sheep Road on one side, Kokosing Road perpendicular.
In the center of the property was the ranch house and the ranch house was surrounded by trees.
Let me out.
Every tree here is a year old at most except those.
Where's the silo?
Inside the trees, I wanna say on the Ieft but that may have been a barn.
I remembered the best I could, gents, but I didn't know this place would now be smothered in tract homes.
So, you know, I'm sorry that I'm not Rain Man over here.
-alex Mahone.
How are you?
-Lyle Sands.
We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire Salt Lake City Field Office are at your disposal.
Thank you.
Do you have the files my office requested on D.B. Cooper?
We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.
If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.
Sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River 8?
I am.
And they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money.
So how about those files, Lyle?
-Silo.
Silo, silo.
-This is stupid.
-We're gonna get made out here.
-AII right, shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the Ieft of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
Something was in their way.
The silo.
Our money should be right there, under that garage.
You better be right, boy.
This isn't a high-end subdivision.
They slapped this place up overnight.
The silo's foundations might still be there.
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete for the garage floor right on top of it.
We'II dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.
If not, we go.
Let's do it.
Oh, man.
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.
Season 2 Episode 6 Subdivision
People die all the time, boys.
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.
-Let me out of here, man.
Come on, guys.
-Well, we gotta do something.
And it's not gonna involve hurting anyone.
I got an idea.
First, we're gonna need some supplies.
A hundred and 1 0 percent, I do not agree with this.
Everybody's gotta pitch in to make this happen.
But back in the big house, the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.
Which is why we're doing it here.
If he gets caught in town, he ain't got a clue where the house is.
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.
I could have died in there, man.
Well, guess what.
I need you to do something.
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.
Well, we'II talk once you prove we can trust you.
What do I gotta do?
I want you to go back to that garden center and get everything on this list.
And gas up the car.
And we'II meet you right back here in an hour.
-AII right.
-And, David don't screw this up.
This ain't Fox River no more, man.
You're looking at the real deal now.
But I want my cut.
Be back in an hour.
Let's go.
Mistake.
Big mistake.
Oh, come on, now.
Am I glad to see you.
You walk here?
No, it's just a Iong story, man.
I thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met a few roadblocks.
And you?
Yeah.
Well, Iet me guess.
You're going to Tooele.
Yeah.
Well, looks like we're going the same direction.
Hopefully, we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey, look I'II make it worth your while.
We've got some good news, sir.
We got our first tip on Patoshik.
Spotted at a burger joint in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.
Hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is Utah and D.B. Cooper.
Got it.
Lyle.
There's a guy listed as having the only D.B. Cooper bill ever found.
-Harold Jenkins.
-Yeah.
D.B. bought gas from Jenkins with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.
We checked the serial numbers and they matched.
You worked the case?
Fresh out of the academy and nobody's cracked it yet.
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.
Jenkins from the gas station, he still alive?
Should be.
He was only 1 8 at the time.
Well, Iet's go say hi to him.
We're sorry, that call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again.
Do you have updates on Sara Tancredi?
I assume that's why you're here.
Yes.
Scofield sent her a message through the mail.
A phone number that was disconnected.
You know, to be honest I was expecting to brief the president.
Yeah, about that.
Right now, as you can imagine, Caroline's quite busy.
She's always been busy.
I've been working with her for 1 5 years.
Paul she's the president of the Unites States now.
Yes, Bill and I helped to put her there.
Well, if you'd Iike for her to remain in office you'II take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.
I wanna talk to her.
You report to me now, and only me.
Don't try and contact Caroline again without my approval and don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given.
Get Burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through Sara Tancredi, by all means pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away we'II go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.
Now, do you have anything else on Sara?
The president has unwavering faith in you.
She wants you to go through Senate approval with your eyes wide open.
-So what are we up against?
-Key allies in the House and Senate are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Sommerville.
-Counting on them to sway the middle.
-Who's the opposition?
Senators blake and Killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.
Any indication as to why?
Political payback for the president's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
-Dad.
Lance, this is my father, Frank.
-pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor, are you with me?
Absolutely.
Yo, just chill, dog.
Listen once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'II drop a dime and they'II find you.
Just be quiet.
Just chill, man.
Woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
I need Sheriff Williams.
Yeah, I'II hold.
Woody?
Where'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Then I'd sell them on the docks, make a few bucks.
You were in school, of course.
I was just looking, pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
I can look at the menu, doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
-That's it.
-No, absolutely.
We're good.
Now, it's just up to the kid.
-Did you get everything?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
-What?
-Nothing.
It's cool.
I handled it.
-What?
-Whoa.
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady, he got a bad vibe so he picked up his cellie phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.
-What?
!
-I hit him with the shovel, man.
I didn't know what else to do.
I tied him up and I put him in the back room with that other country hick.
-Here we go.
Here we go.
-I came through, you gimp.
-Who was he calling?
-The sheriff.
Man, I don't know, dude.
It just set off so quick.
-Did the call go through?
-Maybe, man.
I don't know.
Maybe?
Did the call go through?
Yes, I-
- No, I don't know.
I don't know, man.
Yo, but I got the gear.
We gotta move on this now.
Yes?
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.
Right here.
alexander Mahone, FBI.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
-What are you here for?
-D.B. Cooper.
People still wanna know about that guy?
Unbelievable.
You worked the gas station in American Fork where he filled up.
Yeah.
Normal-Iooking guy.
Barely said a word.
There were some discrepancies in the statement you filed 30 years ago.
In the report, it's noted that you said he filled up at 7 a.m but on another occasion, you said it was 7 p.m.
-Which was it?
-Both.
He gassed up twice?
Yeah.
Full tanks both times?
Yeah.
Why?
A systems what?
It's a systems diagnostics test.
Footage from our gopher cam picked up exactly where your line was corrupted.
And who corrupted it?
-You guys?
-Maybe.
AII I know is my supervisor called and said he wants me and my crew to get over here and fix that problem double quick, double time.
-So you're not with the electric company?
-No, ma'am.
Now, feel free to call your company.
But I tell you, all they'II do is send over some tech.
Maybe tomorrow, if you're lucky.
And he'II spend a whole day trying to find the problem and another day trying to fix it.
But we're here right now.
And we're ready to turn your juice back on.
My juice?
That's right.
And that's your crew?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving a 1 965 Chevy Nova.
There's no record on file that Cooper even had a car.
But Charles Westmoreland did and the car registered to him at the time was a 1 965 Chevy Nova with a 1 6-gallon gas tank.
Back then, a Chevy that size got approximately eight miles to the gallon.
D.B. stopped at the station in American Fork and gassed up once early that day and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico, which is a straight shot south drive off the main road for an all-day detour?
-The money.
-Exactly.
Cooper, Westmoreland, jumped out of a plane with $5 million.
But Westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that magic marker.
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them, I wanna know about it.
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well, who's gonna pay for this and what about the cleanup and the repair?
Well, the company will cover all costs.
We'II just dig a small trench.
Once we're finished, we'II re-Iay the cement.
It'II look as good as new.
How long is it gonna take?
One way or another, we'II be out of here today.
Really need to get started, ma'am.
Wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight, now, would we?
Well, that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
Fine.
It's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.
You might wanna take in that tennis game after all.
Oh, no, it's too hot for that now.
plus, I gotta keep an eye on you all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
-How are you?
-Good.
AII right, where's Tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.
-We're gonna have to cut up the cement.
-Yo, we gots company.
What's up, snowflake?
Well, as always, your timing is flawless.
-I don't follow.
-Well, Iet me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre, I know you trust me and you know I'II cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute, hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in, you say no then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
And then you decide to play nice and then we're one big happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
And kicking, homeboy.
How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for Uncle Sam all over the world--
How are you guys doing?
Who are you?
Who are they?
I had to call my supervisor.
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.
They want to get this done as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
Well, Jeanette, Iike I said, there's a Iot of work to do and it's gonna be noisy.
Oh, drinks.
I forgot to ask.
We're good.
Thanks.
Yo, man, this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig, I'II volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'II be watching.
Billy?
Is that you?
Billy, is that you?
Yeah.
Thank you kindly.
Well, now, how did you get out of working?
Union rules.
One crew member always has to supervise.
I'II check on them in a bit.
Lemonade?
Little more ice?
Yeah.
And I Iike mine with a Iittle oomph.
But since you're on the clock I guess you can't join me?
Just two fingers.
AII right.
It's been a while.
Yeah?
Whiskey always makes me feel irascible.
I don't know what that means.
But I do like the sound of it.
Are you wearing Angel perfume?
I am.
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.
Yeah.
Now, is that good memories or bad memories?
Both.
Did you talk to Maricruz?
I don't wanna talk about her.
I gotta get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre down the road, if you're in trouble, Europeangoldfinch.net.
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
-What's it called?
-Europeangoldfinch.net.
That's a bird, right?
I got something.
-It's the silo's foundation.
-Hells, yeah.
Thank you, Charles.
We just need to find the edge and dig underneath it.
We'II get the money, hit the back roads.
What's wrong?
We got to stop in Tooele first and gas up our ride.
I thought you already did that.
Man, when the garden center thing happened, I just forgot, all right?
I want you to go back into town.
I want you to gas up that car because I'm not driving around with millions of dollars in the trunk.
-Do you understand?
-Man, why do I got to do it?
Okay.
Okay.
I better check in on our friend.
You got it all the time.
Miss Tinsel toes.
Billy?
Billy?
Yeah?
I made you a sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
Just like you Iike.
I'm so glad you came back.
I don't wanna say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.
Where is that?
Where's what, sweetheart?
That painting.
It's Holland, where I grew up.
You know that.
-It's beautiful.
-Oh, there's no place better.
It's so peaceful so protected from this crazy world.
-Operator.
-Hello, operator.
There's an intruder in my house.
Hello, ma 'am?
Ma 'am, are you there?
Is anyone there?
Heard you had some activity in Tooele today.
A bit.
Don't see how it warrants a visit from the FBI.
A stolen car was dumped outside of town belonging to a woman from St. Louis.
-Am I getting that right?
-Yes, sir.
And then here, the owner's girlfriend reports him missing and then his buddy comes by to check it out and he goes missing too.
Woody and Chet have been known to drop everything and go boar hunting when the opportunity arises.
And they don't tell their old ladies.
Mr. Mahone, I'II bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.
His dad will be showing up soon with the keys and you can look for yourself.
Whoa, what are you doing?
Mr. Mahone.
They're here.
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.
Who's there?
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
-Can you tell me what happened?
-There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her do her routine.
She'd rub her lotion on, comb her hair dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh, you're killing me.
She had this spot on her neck right here.
Gave her goose bumps every time.
And that perfume....
My ex, he was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
It was wham, bam, thank you, Sam.
Well, shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went our separate ways.
Do you know what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
Amen to that.
Speaking of could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only, you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreeter.
You know that big guy?
The strong guy that doesn't speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would Iike to have a drink with me after he punches out?
please.
You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?
please.
-Hey, Dad.
-Sara, I've been trying to reach you.
Uh, yeah, I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
-You in Washington?
-Yeah, I'm coming back on the next flight.
-I thought you're gonna be there for a while.
-No, plan's changed.
Sara, you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
I want you to stay away from him.
Who, Lance from my group?
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
I found out some other things too.
-What are you talking about?
-You were right.
-Sara?
-I gotta go.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
-Yo.
-Just one second, sir.
Thank you.
-Can I help you?
-Just put 40 on three.
I'm sorry, what pump was that?
-Three.
-That one's been sticking.
-Okay.
Then, I'II move the car.
-No.
No, don't trouble yourself.
I'II have the mechanic come out and pump it for you.
I've got a customer waiting on three.
-AII right, I'II be right there.
-I'm in a hurry, all right?
Oh, he'II be right out.
Just one second.
Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
-Oh, God.
-Drop!
Where are they?
What?
What?
Where are they?
Hey, man, one hand or not, I think hillbilly needs to be up in here digging.
What you think?
Good man.
What the hell are you doing up here?
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
-I apologize for barging in.
-Don't bother.
She's got the hots for the big strong one.
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
We're gonna get back to work now.
No, I think y'all are done.
And I think y'all need to leave now.
We're almost finished.
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
Sucre, check it out.
Cop.
Oh, thank God.
-Where you going?
-T-Bag, Iet her go!
Oh, God.
She's our only way out of this, pretty.
Don't say a word, you old whore, or I'm gonna cut your throat out.
Previously on Prison Break.
Mr. Kim.
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.
Is pursuing her the best use of your time?
- It is.
- I'll let the President know.
- I contact the President directly.
- I'll contact her.
No family with Patoshik?
Nothing?
Yeah.
Until about four years ago when he killed them all.
Fernando Sucre-- he was in Las Vegas around 2:00.
Out west, just like Bagwell and Franklin.

The money's in Utah, and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them Fox River boys.
- Come on.
You got the map?
- No.
Someone else does.
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.
- Get in.
- Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.
We have to open up in 15 minutes.
So, it doesn't matter.
I dare you.
- I said no.
- I dare you.
Please?
The ranch is gone, Michael.
Well, the five million might not be.
And you gonna find it how?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't want to hear anything out of your mouth other than that your photographic memory spits out regarding that map.
You watch your tone with me, boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was, you're worthless to us.
- Yo, let me out!
- Shut up!
- The map!
- Uh, uh, okay.
Okay, okay, all right, all right, all right...
The ranch...

We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire Salt Lake City field office are at your disposal.
Thank you.
Do you have those files my office
- requested on the D.B. Cooper case?
- We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.
If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.
Hey, sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River Eight?
I am, and they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money, so how about those files, Lyle?
Silo.
Silo, silo, silo, silo.
This is stupid.
We're going to get made out here.
Ah, shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the left of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time, but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
- Something was in their way.
- The silo.
Our money should be right there under that garage.
You better be right, boy.
This isn't a high-end subdivision.
They slapped this place up overnight.
The silo's foundation might still be there.
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete for the garage floor right on top of it.
We'll dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.
- But if not, we go.
- Let's do it.
- Oh, man.
- Uh-uh.
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.
People die all the time, boys.
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.
Let me out!
Well, we got to do something.
And it's not going to involve hurting anyone.
I got an idea.
First, we're going to need some supplies.
110% do not agree with this.
Everybody's got to pitch in to make this happen.
But back in the big house, the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.
Which is why we're doing it here.
If he gets caught in town, he ain't got a clue where the house is.
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.
O h.
You know, I could have died in there, man.
Well, guess what?
We need you to do something.
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.
Well, we'll talk once you prove we can trust you.
What do I got to do?
I want you to go back to that Garden Center and get everything on this list.
Then gas up the car.
And we'll meet you right back here in an hour.
- All right.
- And David...
Don't screw this up.
This ain't Fox River no more, man.
You're looking at the real deal now.
But I want my cut.
I'll be back in an hour.
Let's go.
Mistake.
Big mistake.
Come on, man.
Am I glad to see you.
Did you walk here?
Well, no... it's...
it's just a long story, man.
Thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met a...
I met a few roadblocks.
You?
Yeah.
Let me guess...
you're going to Tooele.
Yep.
Well, it looks like we're going in the same direction.
Hopefully we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey...
I'll make it worth your while.
Got some good news, sir.
Got our first tip on Patoshik.
Spotted at a burger joint in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.
Just hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is Utah and D.B. Cooper.
Got it.
Lyle.
There's a guy here listed as having the only
D.B. Cooper bill ever found in circulation, Harold Jenkins.
Yeah, D.B. bought gas from Jenkins with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.
We checked the serial numbers and they matched.
- You worked the case?
- Fresh out of the academy.
And nobody's cracked it yet.
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.
This Jenkins from the gas station, he still alive?
Should be.
He was only 18 at the time.
Let's go say hi to him.
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again.
I'm assuming you're here because you have updates on Sara Tancredi?
Yes, um, Scofield sent her a message through the mail, that phone number that was disconnected.
You know, to be honest, uh,
I was expecting to brief the President.
Yeah, about that, uh, right now, as you can imagine,
- Caroline's quite busy.
- She's always been busy.
I've been working side-by-side with her for 15 years.
Paul, she's the President of the United States now.
Yes, Bill, and I helped put her there.
Well, if you'd like for her to remain in office, you'll take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.
I want to talk to her.
You report to me now, and only me.
You're not to try and contact Caroline again without my approval, and you don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given;
get Burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through Sara Tancredi, by all means, pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away, we'll go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.
Now do you have anything else on Sara?
The President has unwavering faith in you.
Wants to make sure you go through the
Senate approval process with your eyes wide open.
So what are we up against?
Key allies in the House and Senate are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Summerville.
We're counting on them to sway the middle.
But who's the opposition?
Senators Blake and Killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.
Any indications to why?
Political payback for the President's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
- Lance, this is, uh, my father Frank.
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor, are you with me?
Absolutely.
No, just chill, dawg.
Listen, once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'll drop a dime and they will find you.
Just be quiet.
Just chill, man.
Woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
I need Sheriff Williams.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Woody?
When'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Sell 'em on the docks, make a few bucks.
When you were at school, of course.
I was just looking, Pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
"I can look at the menu.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna eat."
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
That's it.
No, absolutely.
We're good.
Now it's just up to the kid.
Did you get everything?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
What?
Nothing.
It's cool.
I handled it.
- Whoa!
- What?
!
Whoa.
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady.
He got a bad vibe, so he picked up his celly phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.
You did what?
!
I hit him with a shovel, man!
I didn't know what else to do!
So I just, I tied him up and in put him in the back room with that other country hick.
- Here we go.
Here we go.
- I came through, you gimp!
- Who was he calling?
- The sheriff.
Man, man, I don't know, dude.
It just, it set off...
- Did the call go through?
!
- Maybe, man...
What do you mean, maybe?
Did the call go through?
!
Yes.
No, I don't know!
I don't know, man.
Yo, but I got the gear.
We got to move on this now.
Yes?
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.
- Right here.
- Alexander Mahone, FBI.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
- What are you here for?
- D.B. Cooper.
People still want to know about that guy?
Unbelievable.
You worked the gas station in American Fork where he filled up.
Yeah.
Normal-looking guy.
Barely said a word.
There were some discrepancies in the statement you filed 30 years ago.
In the report, it's noted that you said he filled up at 7:00 a.m., but on another occasion, you said it was 7:00 p.m.
- Which was it?
- Both.
- He gassed up twice?
- Yeah.
- Full tanks both times?
- Yeah.
Why?
A systems what?
It's a systems diagnostics test.
Footage from our gopher cam picked up exactly where your line was corrupted.
- And who corrupted it, you guys?
- Maybe.
All I know is my supervisor called and said he wants me and my crew to get over here and fix that problem double-quick, double-time.
So... you're not with the electric company?
No, ma'am.
Now feel free to call your company, but I should tell you, all they'll do is send over some tech, maybe tomorrow if you're lucky.
And he'll spend a whole day trying to find the problem and another day trying to fix it.
But we're here right now and we're ready to turn your juice back on.
- My juice?
- That's right.
And, uh... and that's your... crew?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving a 1965 Chevy Nova.
There's no record on file that Cooper even had a car.
But Charles Westmoreland did, and the car registered to him at the time was a 1965 Chevy Nova with a 16-gallon gas tank.
Back then, a Chevy that size probably got what, eight miles to the gallon?
Now, D.B. stopped at the station in American Fork, gassed up once early that day and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico, which is a straight shot south, drive off the main road for an all-day detour?
The money.
Exactly.
Cooper/Westmoreland jumped out of a plane with $5 million.
But Westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that Magic Marker.
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns, and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them, I want to know about it.
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well, who's gonna pay for this and what about the cleanup and the repair?
Well, the company will cover all costs.
We'll just dig a small trench, once we're finished, we'll re-lay the cement.
It'll look as good as new.
How long is it going to take?
One way or another, we'll be out of here today.
We really need to get started, ma'am.
We wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight, now do we?
Now that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
Fine, that's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.
You might want take in that tennis game after all.
Oh, no it's...
it's too hot for that now.
Plus, I'm gonna keep an eye on y'all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
- How are you?
- Good.
All right, where's Tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.
We're going to have to cut up the cement.
Yo, we gots company.
What's up, snowflake?
As always, your timing is flawless.
I don't follow.
Well, let me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh, oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre, I know you trust me.
And you know I'll cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute.
Hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in, you say no.
Then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
Then you decide to play nice and then we're one big, happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
- And kicking', home boy.
- How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for Uncle Sam all over the world...
How are you guys doing?
Who are you?
Who are they?
I, uh, I had to call my supervisor.
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.
We want to get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Well, Jeanette, like I said, there's a lot of work to do, and it's going to be noisy.
- Oh, drinks.
I forgot to ask.
- We're good.
Thanks.
Yo, man, this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig, I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'll be watching.
Billy?
Is that you?
Billy?
Is that you?
Yep.
Oh.
Thank you kindly.
Well now, how did you get out of working?
Union rules.
Uh, one crew member always has to supervise.
I'll check on them in a bit.
- Lemonade?
- Mm.
Hmm...
More ice.
Yeah.
And I like mine with a little...
Oops.
But since you're on the clock, I guess you can't... join me?
Just two fingers.
Been a while.
Yeah?
Whiskey always makes me feel... irascible.
I don't know what that means.
But I do like the sound of it.
Are you wearing Angel perfume?
I am.
Oh, hmm...
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.
Yeah.
Now, was that good memories... or bad memories?
Both.
- Did you talk to Maricruz?
- I don't want to talk about it.
I got to get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre... down the road, if you're in trouble, europeangoldfinch.net.
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
- What's it called?
- Europeangoldfinch.net.
That's a bird, right?
I got something.
It's the silo's foundation.
Hells, yeah.
Thank you, Charles.
We just need to find the edge and dig underneath it.
We'll get the money... hit the back roads.
- Uh, well...
- What's wrong?
We gots to stop in Tooele first and gas up the ride.
I thought you already did that.
Man, when the garden center thing happened I just forgot, all right?
I want you to go back into town--
I want you to gas up that car.
Because I'm not driving around with millions of dollars in the trunk, do you understand?
Man, why do I gots to do it...?
Okay.
Okay.
Better check in on our friend.
Miss Tinsel Toes.
Billy?
Billy?
Yeah.
I made you a sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
Just like you like.
I'm so glad you came back.
I don't want to say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.
Where is that?
Where's what, sweetheart?
That painting.
Oh, it's Holland.
Where I grew up.
You know that.
It's beautiful.
Oh, there's no place better.
It's so peaceful, so...
so protected from this crazy world.
Hello, Operator?
There's an intruder in my house...
Hello, ma'am?
Ma'am?
Are you there?
Is anyone there?
Heard you had some activity in Tooele today.
A bit.
Don't see how it warrants a visit from the FBI.
A stolen car was dumped just outside of town, belonging to a woman who went to school in St. Louis, am I getting that right?
Yes, sir.
And then here, the owner's girlfriend reports him missing, and then his buddy comes by to check it out and he... goes missing, too.
Yeah, but Woody and Chet have been known to drop everything and go boar hunting when the opportunity presents itself, and they don't tell their old ladies.
Mr. Mahone, I'll bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.
But Woody's dad'll be showing up soon with the keys and... you can look for yourself.
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
!
Mr. Mahone.
Shh.
They're here.
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.
Who's there?
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
Can you tell me what happened?
There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long... bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her... do her routine, see.
Rub her lotion on, comb her hair.
Dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh, you're killing me.
She had this spot on her neck right... here.
Gave her goosebumps every time.
And that perfume...
My ex.
He was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
He was ram, damn, thank you, Sam.
Well, shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went out separate ways.
Do you know... what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
Amen to that.
Speaking of.
Could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreter.
You know that, that big guy the strong guy that, that doesn't... speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would like to have a drink with me after he punches out?
Please.
You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?
Please?
Hey, Dad.
Sarah.
I've been trying to reach you.
Uh, yeah.
I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
Um...
You in Washington?
Yeah, but I'm coming back on the next flight.
I thought you were going to be there for a while.
No, no.
Plans changed, okay?
Sarah, do you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
- I want you to stay away from him.
- Who, Lance?
From my, my group?
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
And I found out some other things, too.
- What are you talking about?
- You were right.
- Sarah?
- I gotta go.
Yo.
Uh, just one second, sir.
Thank you.
How can I help you?
Just put $40 on three.
I'm sorry.
Uh...
What pump was that?
Three.
Oh, that one's been sticking.
Okay, well, then, I'll move the car.
Ah, no.
Don't-- Don't trouble yourself.
I'll have the, uh, mechanic come out and pump it for you.
Hey, we got a customer waiting on three!
Yo, look, man, I'm in a hurry, all right?
Oh, he'll be right out.
Just one second.
Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
Drop!
Where are they?
Where... are... they?
All right, man.
One hand or not, I think Hillbilly needs to be up ahead digging.
What you think?
Good man.
Oh.
What the hell are you doing up here?
Uh, I'm sorry, Jeannette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
Don't bother.
She's got the hots for the big, strong one.
I'm sorry, Jeannette.
We're gonna... we're gonna get back to work now.
No, I think y'all are done, and I think y'all need to leave now.
We're almost finished.
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
Sucre, check it out.
Cop.
Thank God.
Oh, let her go, T-Bag.
She's our only way out of this, pretty.
Don't say a word, you old whore, or I'll cut your throat out.
Previously on Prison Break:
Mr. Kim.
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.
Is pursuing her the best use of your time?
It is.
I'll let the President know.
I contact the President directly.
I'll contact her.
No family with Patoshik?
Nothing?
Yeah.
Until about four years ago when he killed them all.
Fernando Sucre-- he was in Las Vegas around 2:00.
Out west, just-just like Bagwell and Franklin.
You know D.B. Cooper?
The money's in Utah, and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them Fox River boys.
(grunting)
Oh.
Come on.
You got the map?
No.
Someone else does.
Before I destroyed it,
I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth
Westmoreland's buried booty.
Get in.
Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.

We have to open up in 15 minutes.
So, it doesn't matter.
I dare you.
BOY:
I said...
I said no.
(scoffs):
I dare you.
Please?
(screaming)
LINCOLN:
The ranch is gone, Michael.
Well, the five million might not be.
T-BAG:
And you gonna find it how?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't want to hear anything out of your mouth other than what your photographic memory spits out regarding that map.
You watch your tone with me, boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was, you're worthless to us.
TWEENER:
Yo, let me out!
Shut up!
The map!
T-BAG:
Uh, uh, okay.
Okay, okay, all right, all right, all right...
The ranch...
The ranch was in the center of a box-- Sheep Road on one side,
Kokosing Road perpendicular.
In the center of the property was the ranch house.
And the ranch house was surrounded by trees.
Every tree here is a year old at most.
Except those.
Where is the silo?
In... side the trees.
I want to say on the left, but that may have been a barn.
I remembered the best I could, gents, but I didn't know this place would now be smothered in tract homes, so, you know, I'm sorry that I-I'm not Rainman over here.
?
...how are you
Lyle Sands.
We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire Salt Lake City field office are at your disposal.

Do you have those files my office requested on the D.B. Cooper case?
We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.
If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.
Hey, sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River Eight?
I am, and they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money, so how about those files, Lyle?
T-BAG:
Silo.
Silo, silo, silo, silo.
This is stupid.
We're going to get made out here.
Ah, shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the left of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time, but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
Something was in their way.

Mistake.
Big mistake.

Am I glad to see you.
Did you walk here?
Well, no... it's... it's-it's just a long story, man.
Thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met a...
I met a few roadblocks.
You?
Yeah.
Let me guess... you're going to Tooele.
Yep.
Well, it looks like we're going in the same direction.
Hopefully we're not too late.

You report to me now, and only me.
You're not to try and contact Caroline again without my approval, and you don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given;
get Burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through
Sara Tancredi, by all means, pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away,
we'll go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.
Now do you have anything else on Sara?
The President has unwavering faith in you.
Wants to make sure you go through the Senate approval process with your eyes wide open.
So what are we up against?
Key allies in the House and Senate are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Summerville.
We're counting on them to sway the middle.
But who's the opposition?
Senators Blake and Killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.
Any indications to why?
Political payback for the President's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
£¿£¿£¿Dad
Uh, Lance, this is, uh, my father Frank.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor, are you with me?
Absolutely.
(man grunting)
No, just chill, dawg.
Listen, once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'll drop a dime and they will find you.
Just be quiet.
Just chill, man.
(grunting gets louder)
(muffled):
I'm gonna kill you!
Woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
(dialing tones)
I need Sheriff Williams.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Woody?
When'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Sell 'em on the docks, make a few bucks.
When you were at school, of course.
I was just looking, Pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
"I can look at the menu.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna eat."
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
That's it.
No, absolutely.
We're good.
Now it's just up to the kid.
Did you get everything?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
What?
Nothing.
It's cool.
I handled it.
What?
!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady.
He got a bad vibe, so he picked up his celly phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.
You did what?
!
I hit him with a shovel, man!
I didn't know what else to do!
So I just, I tied him up and in put him in the back room with that other country hick.
Here we go.
Here we go.
I came through, you gimp!
Who was he calling?
The sheriff.
Man, man, I-I don't know, dude.
It just, it set off...
Did the call go through?
!
Maybe, man...
What do you mean, maybe?
Did the call go through?
!
Yes.
No, I don't know!
I don't know, man.
Yo, but I got the gear.
We got to move on this now.
(doorbell rings)
Yes?
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.
Right here.
Alexander Mahone, FBI.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
What are you here for?
D.B. Cooper.
People still want to know about that guy?
Unbelievable.
You worked the gas station in American Fork where he filled up.
Yeah.
Normal-looking guy.
Barely said a word.
There were some discrepancies in the statement you filed 30 years ago.
In the report, it's noted that you said he filled up at 7:00 a.m., but on another occasion, you said it was 7:00 p.m.
Which was it?
Both.
He gassed up twice?
Yeah.
Full tanks both times?
Yeah.
Why?
WOMAN:
A systems what?
It's a systems diagnostics test.
Footage from our gopher cam picked up exactly where your line was corrupted.
And who corrupted it, you guys?
Maybe.
All I know is my supervisor called and said he wants me and my crew to get over here and fix that problem double-quick, double-time.
So... you're not with the electric company?
No, ma'am.
Now feel free to call your company, but I should tell you, all they'll do is send over some tech, maybe tomorrow if you're lucky.
And he'll spend a whole day trying to find the problem and another day trying to fix it.
But we're here right now and we're ready to turn your juice back on.
My juice?
That's right.
And, uh... and that's your... crew?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving a 1965 Chevy Nova.
There's no record on file that Cooper even had a car.
But Charles Westmoreland did, and the car registered to him at the time was a 1965 Chevy Nova with a 16-gallon gas tank.
Back then, a Chevy that size probably got what, eight miles to the gallon?
Now, D.B. stopped at the station in American Fork, gassed up once early that day and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico, which is a straight shot south, drive off the main road for an all-day detour?
The money.
Exactly.
Cooper/Westmoreland jumped out of a plane with $5 million.
But Westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that Magic Marker.
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns, and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them,
I want to know about it.
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well, who's gonna pay for this and what about the cleanup and the repair?
Well, the company will cover all costs.
We'll just dig a small trench, once we're finished, we'll re-lay the cement.
It'll look as good as new.
How long is it going to take?
One way or another, we'll be out of here today.
We really need to get started, ma'am.
We wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight, now do we?
Now that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
Fine, that's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.
You might want take in that tennis game after all.
Oh, no it's... it's too hot for that now.
Plus, I'm gonna keep an eye on y'all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
How are you?
Good.
All right, where's Tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.
We're going to have to cut up the cement.
Yo, we gots company.
What's up, snowflake?
your timing is flawless.
I don't follow.
Well, let me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh, oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre, I know you trust me.
And you know I'll cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
C-NOTE:
Wait a minute.
Hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in, you say no.
Then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
Then you decide to play nice and then we're one big, happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
And kicking', home boy.
How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for Uncle Sam all over the world...
How are you guys doing?
Who are you?
Who are they?
I, uh, I had to call my supervisor.
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.
We want to get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Well, Jeanette, like I said, there's a lot of work to do, and it's going to be noisy.
Oh, drinks.
I forgot to ask.
We're good.
Thanks.
Yo, man, this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig,
I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'll be watching.
Billy?
Is that you?
Billy?
Is that you?
Yep.
Oh.
Thank you kindly.
Mm-hmm.
Well now, how did you get out of working?
Union rules.
Uh, one crew member always has to supervise.
I'll check on them in a bit.
Lemonade?
Mm.
Hmm...
More ice.
Yeah.
And I like mine with a little...
Oops.
But since you're on the clock, I guess you can't... join me?
Just two fingers.
Been a while.
Yeah?
Whiskey always makes me feel... irascible.
I don't know what that means.
But I do like the sound of it.
Are you wearing Angel perfume?
I am.
Oh, hmm...
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.
Yeah.
Now, was that good memories... or bad memories?
Both.
Did you talk to Maricruz?
I don't want to talk about it.
I got to get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre... down the road, if you're in trouble, europeangoldfinch.net.
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
What's it called?
Europeangoldfinch.net.
That's a bird, right?
I got something.
It's the silo's foundation.
Hells, yeah.
Thank you, Charles.
We just need to find the edge and dig underneath it.
We'll get the money... hit the back roads.
Uh, well...
What's wrong?
We gots to stop in Tooele first and gas up the ride.
I thought you already did that.
Man, when the garden center thing happened
I just forgot, all right?
I want you to go back into town--
I want you to gas up that car.
Because I'm not driving around with millions of dollars in the trunk, do you understand?
Man, why do I gots to do it...?
Okay.
Okay.
Better check in on our friend.
...all the time.
(chuckles):
Miss Tinsel Toes.
Billy?
Yeah.
I made you a sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
Just like you like.
I'm so glad you came back.
I don't want to say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.
Where is that?
Where's what, sweetheart?
That painting.
Oh, it's Holland.
Where I grew up.
You know that.
It's beautiful.
Oh, there's no place better.
It's so peaceful, so... so protected from this crazy world.
Hello, Operator?
There's an intruder in my house...
Hello, ma'am?
Ma'am?
Are you there?
Hello, ma'am?
Is anyone there?
MAHONE:
Heard you had some activity in Tooele today.
A bit.
Don't see how it warrants a visit from the FBI.
A stolen car was dumped just outside of town, belonging to a woman who went to school in St. Louis, am I getting that right?
Yes, sir.
And then here, the owner's girlfriend reports him missing, and then his buddy comes by to check it out and he... goes missing, too.
Yeah, but Woody and Chet have been known to drop everything and go boar hunting when the opportunity presents itself, and they don't tell their old ladies.
Mr. Mahone, I'll bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.
But Woody's dad'll be showing up soon with the keys and... you can look for yourself.
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
!
Mr. Mahone.
Shh.
They're here.
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.
Who's there?
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
Can you tell me what happened?
There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long... bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her... do her routine, see.
?
Dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh, you're killing me.
She had this spot on her neck right... here.
Gave her goosebumps every time.
And that perfume...
My ex.
He was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
He was ram, damn, thank you, Sam.
Well, shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went out separate ways.
Do you know... what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
Amen to that.
Speaking of.
Could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreter.
You know that, that big guy the strong guy that, that doesn't... speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would like to have a drink with me after he punches out?
Please.
You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?
Please?
Hey, Dad.
Sarah.
I've been trying to reach you.
Uh, yeah.
I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
Um...
You in Washington?
Yeah, but I'm coming back on the next flight.
I thought you were going to be there for a while.
No, no.
Plans changed, okay?
Sarah, do you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
I want you to stay away from him.
Who, Lance?
From my, my group?
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
And I found out some other things, too.
What are you talking about?
You were right.
Karen?
?
Yo.
Uh, just one second, sir.
How can I help you?
Just put $40 on three.
I'm sorry.
Uh...
What pump was that?
Three.
Oh, that one's been sticking.
Okay, well, then, I'll move the car.
Ah, no.
Don't--
Don't trouble yourself.
I'll have the, uh, mechanic come out and pump it for you.
Hey, we got a customer waiting on three!
Yo, look, man, I'm in a hurry, all right?
Oh, he'll be right out.
Just one second.
Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
Drop!
Where are they?
Where... are... they?
All right, man.
One hand or not, I think Hillbilly needs to be up ahead digging.
What you think?
Good man.
Oh.
What the hell are you doing up here?
Uh, I'm sorry, Jeannette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
I apologize for barging in.
She's got the hots for the big, strong one.
I'm sorry, Jeannette.
We're gonna... we're gonna get back to work now.
No, I think y'all are done, and I think y'all need to leave now.
We're almost finished.
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
Sucre, check it out.
Cop.
Thank God.
?
Let her go, T-Bag.
Oh, God.
She's our only way out of this, pretty.
Don't say a word, you old whore, or I'll cut your throat out.
Previously on Prison Break.
Mr. Kim.
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.
Is pursuing her the best use of your time?
- It is.
- I'll let the President know.
- I contact the President directly.
- I'll contact her.
No family with Patoshik?
Nothing?
Yeah.
Until about four years ago when he killed them all.
Fernando Sucre- he was in Las Vegas around 2:00.
Out west, just like Bagwell and Franklin.
You know D.B. Cooper?
The money's in Utah, and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them Fox River boys.
- Come on.
You got the map?
- No.
Someone else does.
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.
- Get in.
- Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.
We have to open up in 15 minutes.
So, it doesn't matter.
I dare you.
- I said no.
- I dare you.
Please?
The ranch is gone, Michael.
Well, the five million might not be.
And you gonna find it how?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't want to hear anything out of your mouth other than that your photographic memory spits out regarding that map.
You watch your tone with me, boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was, you're worthless to us.
- Yo, let me out!
- Shut up!
- The map!
- Uh, uh, okay.
Okay, okay, all right, all right, all right...
The ranch...
The ranch was in the center of a box-
Sheep Road on one side, Kokosing Road perpendicular.
In the center of the property was the ranch house.
And the ranch house was surrounded by trees.
Every tree here is a year old at most.
Except those.
Where is the silo?
In... side the trees.
I want to say on the left, but that may have been a barn.
I remembered the best I could, gents, but I didn't know this place would now be smothered in tract homes, so, you know, I'm sorry that I'm not Rainman over here.
- Mahone.
- Lyle Sands.
We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire Salt Lake City field office are at your disposal.
Thank you.
Do you have those files my office
- requested on the D.B. Cooper case?
- We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.
If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.
Hey, sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River Eight?
I am, and they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money, so how about those files, Lyle?
Silo.
Silo, silo, silo, silo.
This is stupid.
We're going to get made out here.
Ah, shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the left of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time, but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
- Something was in their way.
- The silo.
Our money should be right there under that garage.
You better be right, boy.
This isn't a high-end subdivision.
They slapped this place up overnight.
The silo's foundation might still be there.
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete for the garage floor right on top of it.
We'll dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.
- But if not, we go.
- Let's do it.
- Oh, man.
- Uh-uh.
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.
~ Season 2
- Episode 6 ~ "Subdivision"
People die all the time, boys.
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.
Let me out!
Well, we got to do something.
And it's not going to involve hurting anyone.
I got an idea.
First, we're going to need some supplies.
110% do not agree with this.
Everybody's got to pitch in to make this happen.
But back in the big house, the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.
Which is why we're doing it here.
If he gets caught in town, he ain't got a clue where the house is.
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.
Oh.
You know, I could have died in there, man.
Well, guess what?
We need you to do something.
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.
Well, we'll talk once you prove we can trust you.
What do I got to do?
I want you to go back to that Garden Center and get everything on this list.
Then gas up the car.
And we'll meet you right back here in an hour.
- All right.
- And David...
Don't screw this up.
This ain't Fox River no more, man.
You're looking at the real deal now.
But I want my cut.
I'll be back in an hour.
Let's go.
Mistake.
Big mistake.
Come on, man.
Am I glad to see you.
Did you walk here?
Well, no... it's...
it's just a long story, man.
Thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met a...
I met a few roadblocks.
You?
Yeah.
Let me guess...
you're going to Tooele.
Yep.
Well, it looks like we're going in the same direction.
Hopefully we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey...
I'll make it worth your while.
Got some good news, sir.
Got our first tip on Patoshik.
Spotted at a burger joint in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.
Just hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is Utah and D.B. Cooper.
Got it.
Lyle.
There's a guy here listed as having the only
D.B. Cooper bill ever found in circulation, Harold Jenkins.
Yeah, D.B. bought gas from Jenkins with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.
We checked the serial numbers and they matched.
- You worked the case?
- Fresh out of the academy.
And nobody's cracked it yet.
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.
This Jenkins from the gas station, he still alive?
Should be.
He was only 18 at the time.
Let's go say hi to him.
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again.
I'm assuming you're here because you have updates on Sara Tancredi?
Yes, um, Scofield sent her a message through the mail, that phone number that was disconnected.
You know, to be honest, uh,
I was expecting to brief the President.
Yeah, about that, uh, right now, as you can imagine,
- Caroline's quite busy.
- She's always been busy.
I've been working side-by-side with her for 15 years.
Paul, she's the President of the United States now.
Yes, Bill, and I helped put her there.
Well, if you'd like for her to remain in office, you'll take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.
I want to talk to her.
You report to me now, and only me.
You're not to try and contact Caroline again without my approval, and you don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given;
get Burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through Sara Tancredi, by all means, pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away, we'll go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.
Now do you have anything else on Sara?
The President has unwavering faith in you.
Wants to make sure you go through the
Senate approval process with your eyes wide open.
So what are we up against?
Key allies in the House and Senate are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Summerville.
We're counting on them to sway the middle.
But who's the opposition?
Senators Blake and Killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.
Any indications to why?
Political payback for the President's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
- Lance, this is, uh, my father Frank.
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor, are you with me?
Absolutely.
No, just chill, dawg.
Listen, once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'll drop a dime and they will find you.
Just be quiet.
Just chill, man.
Woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
I need Sheriff Williams.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Woody?
When'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Sell 'em on the docks, make a few bucks.
When you were at school, of course.
I was just looking, Pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
"I can look at the menu.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna eat. "
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
That's it.
No, absolutely.
We're good.
Now it's just up to the kid.
Did you get everything?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
What?
Nothing.
It's cool.
I handled it.
- Whoa!
- What?
!
Whoa.
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady.
He got a bad vibe, so he picked up his celly phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.
You did what?
!
I hit him with a shovel, man!
I didn't know what else to do!
So I just, I tied him up and in put him in the back room with that other country hick.
- Here we go.
Here we go.
- I came through, you gimp!
- Who was he calling?
- The sheriff.
Man, man, I don't know, dude.
It just, it set off...
- Did the call go through?
!
- Maybe, man...
What do you mean, maybe?
Did the call go through?
!
Yes.
No, I don't know!
I don't know, man.
Yo, but I got the gear.
We got to move on this now.
Yes?
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.
- Right here.
- Alexander Mahone, FBI.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
- What are you here for?
- D.B. Cooper.
People still want to know about that guy?
Unbelievable.
You worked the gas station in American Fork where he filled up.

Barely said a word.

But we're here right now and we're ready to turn your juice back on.
- My juice?
- That's right.
And, uh... and that's your... crew?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving a 1965 Chevy Nova.
There's no record on file that Cooper even had a car.
But Charles Westmoreland did, and the car registered to him at the time was a 1965 Chevy Nova with a 16-gallon gas tank.

Now, D.B. stopped at the station in American Fork, gassed up once early that day and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico, which is a straight shot south, drive off the main road for an all-day detour?
The money.
Exactly.
Cooper/Westmoreland jumped out of a plane with $5 million.
But Westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that Magic Marker.
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns, and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them, I want to know about it.
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well, who's gonna pay for this and what about the cleanup and the repair?
Well, the company will cover all costs.
We'll just dig a small trench, once we're finished, we'll re-lay the cement.
It'll look as good as new.
How long is it going to take?
One way or another, we'll be out of here today.
We really need to get started, ma'am.
We wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight, now do we?
Now that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
Fine, that's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.
You might want take in that tennis game after all.
Oh, no it's...
it's too hot for that now.
Plus, I'm gonna keep an eye on y'all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
- How are you?
- Good.
All right, where's Tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.
We're going to have to cut up the cement.
Yo, we gots company.
What's up, snowflake?
As always, your timing is flawless.
I don't follow.
Well, let me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh, oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre, I know you trust me.
And you know I'll cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute.
Hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in, you say no.
Then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
Then you decide to play nice and then we're one big, happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
- And kicking', home boy.
- How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for Uncle Sam all over the world...
How are you guys doing?
Who are you?
Who are they?
I, uh, I had to call my supervisor.
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.
We want to get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Well, Jeanette, like I said, there's a lot of work to do, and it's going to be noisy.
- Oh, drinks.
I forgot to ask.
- We're good.
Thanks.
Yo, man, this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig, I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'll be watching.
Billy?
Is that you?
Billy?
Is that you?
Yep.
Oh.
Thank you kindly.
Well now, how did you get out of working?
Union rules.
Uh, one crew member always has to supervise.
I'll check on them in a bit.
- Lemonade?
- Mm.
Hmm...
More ice.
Yeah.
And I like mine with a little...
Oops.
But since you're on the clock, I guess you can't... join me?
Just two fingers.
Been a while.
Yeah?
Whiskey always makes me feel... irascible.
I don't know what that means.
But I do like the sound of it.
Are you wearing Angel perfume?
I am.
Oh, hmm...
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.
Yeah.
Now, was that good memories... or bad memories?
Both.
- Did you talk to Maricruz?
- I don't want to talk about it.
I got to get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre... down the road, if you're in trouble, europeangoldfinch. net.
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
- What's it called?
- Europeangoldfinch. net.
That's a bird, right?
I got something.
It's the silo's foundation.
Hells, yeah.
Thank you, Charles.
We just need to find the edge and dig underneath it.
We'll get the money... hit the back roads.
- Uh, well...
- What's wrong?
We gots to stop in Tooele first and gas up the ride.
I thought you already did that.
Man, when the garden center thing happened I just forgot, all right?
I want you to go back into town-
I want you to gas up that car.
Because I'm not driving around with millions of dollars in the trunk, do you understand?
Man, why do I gots to do it...?
Okay.
Okay.
Better check in on our friend.
Miss Tinsel Toes.
Billy?
Billy?
Yeah.
I made you a sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
Just like you like.
I'm so glad you came back.
I don't want to say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.
Where is that?
Where's what, sweetheart?
That painting.
Oh, it's Holland.
Where I grew up.
You know that.
It's beautiful.
Oh, there's no place better.
It's so peaceful, so...
so protected from this crazy world.
Hello, Operator?
There's an intruder in my house...
Hello, ma'am?
Ma'am?
Are you there?
Is anyone there?
Heard you had some activity in Tooele today.
A bit.
Don't see how it warrants a visit from the FBI.
A stolen car was dumped just outside of town, belonging to a woman who went to school in St. Louis, am I getting that right?
Yes, sir.
And then here, the owner's girlfriend reports him missing, and then his buddy comes by to check it out and he... goes missing, too.
Yeah, but Woody and Chet have been known to drop everything and go boar hunting when the opportunity presents itself, and they don't tell their old ladies.
Mr. Mahone, I'll bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.
But Woody's dad'll be showing up soon with the keys and... you can look for yourself.
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
!
Mr. Mahone.
Shh.
They're here.
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.
Who's there?
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
Can you tell me what happened?
There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long... bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her... do her routine, see.
Rub her lotion on, comb her hair.
Dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh, you're killing me.
She had this spot on her neck right... here.
Gave her goosebumps every time.
And that perfume...
My ex.
He was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
He was ram, damn, thank you, Sam.
Well, shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went out separate ways.
Do you know... what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
Amen to that.
Speaking of.
Could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreter.
You know that, that big guy the strong guy that, that doesn't... speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would like to have a drink with me after he punches out?
Please.
You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?
Please?
Hey, Dad.
Sarah.
I've been trying to reach you.
Uh, yeah.
I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
Um...
You in Washington?
Yeah, but I'm coming back on the next flight.
I thought you were going to be there for a while.
No, no.
Plans changed, okay?
Sarah, do you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
- I want you to stay away from him.
- Who, Lance?
From my, my group?
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
And I found out some other things, too.
- What are you talking about?
- You were right.
- Sarah?
- I gotta go.
Yo.
Uh, just one second, sir.
Thank you.
How can I help you?
Just put $40 on three.
I'm sorry.
Uh...
What pump was that?
Three.
Oh, that one's been sticking.
Okay, well, then, I'll move the car.
Ah, no.
Don't- Don't trouble yourself.
I'll have the, uh, mechanic come out and pump it for you.
Hey, we got a customer waiting on three!
Yo, look, man, I'm in a hurry, all right?
Oh, he'll be right out.
Just one second.
Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
Drop!
Where are they?
Where... are... they?
All right, man.
One hand or not, I think Hillbilly needs to be up ahead digging.
What you think?
Good man.
Oh.
What the hell are you doing up here?
Uh, I'm sorry, Jeannette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
Don't bother.
She's got the hots for the big, strong one.
I'm sorry, Jeannette.
We're gonna... we're gonna get back to work now.
No, I think y'all are done, and I think y'all need to leave now.
We're almost finished.
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
Sucre, check it out.
Cop.
Thank God.
Oh, let her go, T-Bag.
She's our only way out of this, pretty.
Don't say a word, you old whore, or I'll cut your throat out.
Previously on Prison Break:
Mr. Kim.
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.
Pursuing her the best use of your time?
- It is.
I'll let the president know.
- I contact the president.
I'll contact her.
No family with Patoshik?
Nothing?
- Yeah,
Until about four years ago when he killed them.
Fernando Sucre, He was in Las vegas around 2, out west.
Just like Bagwell and Franklin.
You know D.B. Cooper?
The money's in Utah and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them Fox River boys,
Come on, you got the map?
- No.
Someone else does.
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.
Get in.
- Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.
We have to open up in 15 minutes.
So?
That doesn't matter.
I dare you.
- I said no.
I dare you, please.
The ranch is gone, Michael.
Well, the five million might not be.
And you're gonna find it how?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't wanna hear anything from you other than what your photographic memory spits out regarding that map!
You watch your tone with me, boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was you're worthless to us.
Yo, fools, let me out.
- Shut up.
The map!
- Okay, okay.
All right, all right, all right.
Let me out, boss.
The ranch was in the center of a box.
Sheep Road on one side, Kokosing Road perpendicular.
In the center of the property was the ranch house and the ranch house was surrounded by trees.
Let me out.
Every tree here is a year old at most except those.
Where's the silo?
Inside the trees, I wanna say on the left but that may have been a barn.
I remembered the best I could, gents, but I didn't know this place would now be smothered in tract homes.
So, you know, I'm sorry that I'm not Rain Man over here.
Alex Mahone.
How are you?
- Lyle sands.
We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire salt Lake City Field office are at your disposal.
Thank you.
Do you have the files my office requested on D.B. Cooper?
We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.
If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.
Sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River 8?
I am.
And they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money.
So how about those files, Lyle?
Silo.
Silo, silo.
- This is stupid.
We're gonna get made out here.
- All right, shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the left of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
Something was in their way.
The silo.
Our money should be right there, under that garage.
You better be right, boy.
This isn't a high-end subdivisión.
They slapped this place up overnight.
The silo's foundations might still be there.
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete for the garage floor right on top of it.
We'll dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.
If not, we go.
Let's do it.
Oh, man.
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.
People die all the time, boys.
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.
Let me out of here, man.
Come on, guys.
- Well, we gotta do something.
And it's not gonna involve hurting anyone.
I got an idea.
First, we're gonna need some supplies.
A hundred and 10 percent, I do not agree with this.
Everybody's gotta pitch in to make this happen.
But back in the big house, the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.
Which is why we're doing it here.
If he gets caught in town, he ain't got a clue where the house is.
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.
I could have died in there, man.
Well, guess what.
I need you to do something.
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.
Well, we'll talk once you prove we can trust you.
What do I gotta do?
I want you to go back to that garden center and get everything on this list.
And gas up the car.
And we'll meet you right back here in an hour.
All right.
- And, David don't screw this up.
This ain't Fox River no more, man.
You're looking at the real deal now.
But I want my cut.
Be back in an hour.
Let's go.
Mistake.
Big mistake.
Oh, come on, now.
Am I glad to see you.
You walk here?
No, it's just a long story, man.
I thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met a few roadblocks.
And you?
Yeah.
Well, let me guess.
You're going to Tooele.
Yeah.
Well, looks like we're going the same direction.
Hopefully, we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey, look I'll make it worth your while.
We've got some good news, sir.
We got our first tip on Patoshik.
Spotted at a burger joint in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.
Hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is Utah and D.B. Cooper.
Got it.
Lyle.
There's a guy listed as having the only D.B. Cooper bill ever found.
Harold Jenkins.
- Yeah.
D.B. Bought gas from Jenkins with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.
We checked the serial numbers and they matched.
You worked the case?
Fresh out of the academy and nobody's cracked it yet.
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.
Jenkins from the gas station, he still alive?
Should be.
He was only 18 at the time.
Well, let's go say hi to him.
We're sorry, that call cannot be completed as dialed,
Please check the number and dial again,
Do you have updates on sara Tancredi?
I assume that's why you're here.
Yes.
Scofield sent her a message through the mail.
A phone number that was disconnected.
You know, to be honest I was expecting to brief the president.
Yeah, about that.
Right now, as you can imagine, Caroline's quite busy.
She's always been busy.
I've been working with her for 15 years.
Paul she's the president of the Unites states now.
Yes, Bill and I helped to put her there.
Well, if you'd like for her to remain in office you'll take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.
I wanna talk to her.
You report to me now, and only me.
Don't try and contact Caroline again without my approval and don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given.
Get Burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through sara Tancredi, by all means pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away we'll go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.
Now, do you have anything else on sara?
The president has unwavering faith in you.
She wants you to go through senate approval with your eyes wide open.
So what are we up against?
- Key allies in the House and senate are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and sommerville.
Counting on them to sway the middle.
- Who's the opposition?
Senators Blake and Killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.
Any indication as to why?
Political payback for the president's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
Dad.
Lance, this is my father, Frank.
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor, are you with me?
Absolutely.
Yo, just chill, dog.
Listen once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'll drop a dime and they'll find you.
Just be quiet.
Just chill, man.
Woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
I need sheriff Williams.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Woody?
Where'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Then I'd sell them on the docks, make a few bucks.
You were in school, of course.
I was just looking, pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
I can look at the menu, doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
That's it.
- No, absolutely.
We're good.
Now, it's just up to the kid.
Did you get everything?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
What?
- Nothing.
It's cool.
I handled it.
What?
- Whoa.
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady, he got a bad vibe so he picked up his cellie phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.
What?
!
- I hit him with the shovel, man.
I didn't know what else to do.
I tied him up and I put him in the back room with that other country hick.
Here we go.
Here we go.
- I came through, you gimp.
Who was he calling?
- The sheriff.
Man, I don't know, dude.
It just set off so quick.
Did the call go through?
- Maybe, man.
I don't know.
Maybe?
Did the call go through?
Yes, I...
No, I don't know.
I don't know, man.
Yo, but I got the gear.
We gotta move on this now.
Yes?
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.
Right here.
Alexander Mahone, FBI.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
What are you here for?
- D.B. Cooper.
People still wanna know about that guy?
Unbelievable.
You worked the gas station in American Fork where he filled up.
Yeah.
Normal-Iooking guy.
Barely said a word.
There were some discrepancies in the statement you filed 30 years ago.
In the report, it's noted that you said he filled up at 7 a.
M but on another occasión, you said it was 7 p.m.
Which was it?
- Both.
He gassed up twice?
Yeah.
Full tanks both times?
Yeah.
Why?
A systems what?
It's a systems diagnostics test.
Footage from our gopher cam picked up exactly where your line was corrupted.
And who corrupted it?
You guys?
- Maybe.
All I know is my supervisor called and said he wants me and my crew to get over here and fix that problem double quick, double time.
So you're not with the electric company?
- No, ma'am.
Now, feel free to call your company.
But I tell you, all they'll do is send over some tech.
Maybe tomorrow, if you're lucky.
And he'll spend a whole day trying to find the problem and another day trying to fix it.
But we're here right now.
And we're ready to turn your juice back on.
My juice?
That's right.
And that's your crew?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving a 1965 Chevy Nova.
There's no record on file that Cooper even had a car.
But Charles Westmoreland did and the car registered to him at the time was a 1965 Chevy Nova with a 16-gallon gas tank.
Back then, a Chevy that size got approximately eight miles to the gallon.
D.B. Stopped at the station in American Fork and gassed up once early that day and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico, which is a straight shot south,
, drive off the main road for an all-day detour?
The money.
- Exactly.
Cooper, Westmoreland, jumped out of a plane with $5 million.
But Westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that magic marker.
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them, I wanna know about it.
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well, who's gonna pay for this and what about the cleanup and the repair?
Well, the company will cover all costs.
We'll just dig a small trench.
Once we're finished, we'll re-lay the cement.
It'll look as good as new.
How long is it gonna take?
One way or another, we'll be out of here today.
Really need to get started, ma'am.
Wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight, now, would we?
Well, that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
Fine.
It's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.
You might wanna take in that tennis game after all.
Oh, no, it's too hot for that now.
Plus, I gotta keep an eye on you all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
How are you?
- Good.
All right, where's Tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extensión cord.
We're gonna have to cut up the cement.
- Yo, we gots company.
What's up, snowflake?
Well, as always, your timing is flawless.
I don't follow.
- Well, let me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre, I know you trust me and you know I'll cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute, hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in, you say no then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
And then you decide to play nice and then we're one big happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
And kicking, homeboy.
How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for Uncle sam all over the world...
How are you guys doing?
Who are you?
Who are they?
I had to call my supervisor.
He sent them right over.

Well, Jeanette, like I said, there's a lot of work to do and it's gonna be noisy.
Oh, drinks.
I forgot to ask.
We're good.
Thanks.
Yo, man, this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig, I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you, sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'll be watching.
Billy?
Is that you?
Billy, is that you?
Yeah.
Thank you kindly.
Well, now, how did you get out of working?
Unión rules.
One crew member always has to supervise.
I'll check on them in a bit.
Lemonade?
Little more ice?
Yeah.
And I like mine with a little oomph.
But since you're on the clock I guess you can't join me?
Just two fingers.
All right.
It's been a while.
Yeah?
Whiskey always makes me feel irascible.
I don't know what that means.

I gotta get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre down the road, if you're in trouble, Europeangoldfinch.
Net.
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
What's it called?
- Europeangoldfinch.
Net.
That's a bird, right?
I got something.
It's the silo's foundation.
- Hells, yeah.
Thank you, Charles.
We just need to find the edge and dig underneath it.
We'll get the money, hit the back roads.
What's wrong?
We got to stop in Tooele first and gas up our ride.
I thought you already did that.
Man, when the garden center thing happened, I just forgot, all right?

I want you to gas up that car because I'm not driving around with millions of dollars in the trunk.
Do you understand?
- Man, why do I got to do it?
Okay.
Okay.
I better check in on our friend.
You got it all the time.
Miss Tinsel toes.
Billy?
Billy?
Yeah?
I made you a sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
Just like you like.
I'm so glad you came back.
I don't wanna say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.
Where is that?
Where's what, sweetheart?
That painting.
It's Holland, where I grew up.
You know that.
It's beautiful.
- Oh, there's no place better.
It's so peaceful so protected from this crazy world.
Operator,
- Hello, operator.
There's an intruder in my house.
Hello, ma'am?
Ma'am, are you there?
Is anyone there?
Heard you had some activity in Tooele today.
A bit.
Don't see how it warrants a visit from the FBI.
A stolen car was dumped outside of town belonging to a woman from st.
Louis.
Am I getting that right?
- Yes, sir.
And then here, the owner's girlfriend reports him missing and then his buddy comes by to check it out and he goes missing too.
Woody and Chet have been known to drop everything and go boar hunting when the opportunity arises.
And they don't tell their old ladies.
Mr. Mahone, I'll bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.
His dad will be showing up soon with the keys and you can look for yourself.
Whoa, what are you doing?
Mr. Mahone.
They're here.
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.
Who's there?
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
Can you tell me what happened?
- There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her do her routine.
She'd rub her lotion on, comb her hair dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh, you're killing me.
She had this spot on her neck right here.
Gave her goose bumps every time.
And that perfume...
My ex, he was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
It was wham, bam, thank you, sam.
Well, shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went our separate ways.
Do you know what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
Amen to that.
Speaking of could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only, you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreeter.
You know that big guy?
The strong guy that doesn't speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would like to have a drink with me after he punches out?
Please.
You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?
Please.
Hey, Dad.
- Sara, I've been trying to reach you.
Uh, yeah, I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
You in Washington?
- Yeah, I'm coming back on the next flight.
I thought you're gonna be there for a while.
- No, plan's changed.
Sara, you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
I want you to stay away from him.
Who, Lance from my group?
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
I found out some other things too,
What are you talking about?
- You were right,
Sara?
- I gotta go.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Yo.
- Just one second, sir.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
- Just put 40 on three.
I'm sorry, what pump was that?
Three.
- That one's been sticking.
Okay.
Then, I'll move the car.
- No.
No, don't trouble yourself.
I'll have the mechanic come out and pump it for you.
I've got a customer waiting on three.
All right, I'll be right there.
- I'm in a hurry, all right?
Oh, he'll be right out.
Just one second.
Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
Oh, God.
- Drop!
Where are they?
What?
What?
Where are they?
Hey, man, one hand or not, I think hillbilly needs to be up in here digging.
What you think?
Good man.
What the hell are you doing up here?
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
I apologize for barging in.
- Don't bother.
She's got the hots for the big strong one.
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
We're gonna get back to work now.
No, I think y'all are done.
And I think y'all need to leave now.
We're almost finished.
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
Sucre, check it out.
Cop.
Oh, thank God.
Where you going?
- T-Bag, let her go!
Oh, God.
She's our only way out of this, pretty.
Don't say a word, you old whore, or I'm gonna cut your throat out.
Previously on Prison Break:
Mr. Kim.
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.
-Pursuing her the best use of your time?
-It is.
-I'II let the president know.
-I contact the president.
I'II contact her.
No family with Patoshik?
-Nothing?
- Yeah.
Until about four years ago when he killed them.
Fernando Sucre.
He was in Las Vegas around 2.
Out west.
Just like Bagwell and Franklin.
You know D.B. Cooper?
The money's in Utah and they're all going to get it.
You're one of them Fox River boys.
-Come on, you got the map?
-No.
Someone else does.
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.
-Get in.
-Okay.
Should be dead ahead.
The bastards built over it.
It's gone.
We have to open up in 1 5 minutes.
-So?
That doesn't matter.
I dare you.
-I said no.
I dare you, please.
The ranch is gone, Michael.
Well, the five million might not be.
And you're gonna find it how?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?
I don't wanna hear anything from you other than what your photographic memory spits out regarding that map!
You watch your tone with me, boy.
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.
Because if you can't remember where that silo was you're worthless to us.
-Yo, fools, Iet me out.
-Shut up.
-The map!
-Okay, okay.
AII right, all right, all right.
Let me out, boss.
The ranch was in the center of a box.
Sheep Road on one side, Kokosing Road perpendicular.
In the center of the property was the ranch house and the ranch house was surrounded by trees.
Let me out.
Every tree here is a year old at most except those.
Where's the silo?
Inside the trees, I wanna say on the Ieft but that may have been a barn.
I remembered the best I could, gents, but I didn't know this place would now be smothered in tract homes.
So, you know, I'm sorry that I'm not Rain Man over here.
-alex Mahone.
How are you?
-Lyle Sands.
We've been briefed on all the men at large.
The full force and resources of the entire Salt Lake City Field Office are at your disposal.
Thank you.
Do you have the files my office requested on D.B. Cooper?
We're pulling them now.
And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?
Correct.
If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.
Sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River 8?
I am.
And they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money.
So how about those files, Lyle?
-Silo.
Silo, silo.
-This is stupid.
-We're gonna get made out here.
-AII right, shut it.
I think I remember.
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the Ieft of the ranch house inside the trees.
No.
It's outside the trees.
Right there.
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.
They were all planted at the same time but those two didn't get as much sunlight.
Something was in their way.
The silo.
Our money should be right there, under that garage.
You better be right, boy.
This isn't a high-end subdivision.
They slapped this place up overnight.
The silo's foundations might still be there.
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete for the garage floor right on top of it.
We'II dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.
If not, we go.
Let's do it.
Oh, man.
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.
Season 2 Episode 6 Subdivision
People die all the time, boys.
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.
-Let me out of here, man.
Come on, guys.
-Well, we gotta do something.
And it's not gonna involve hurting anyone.
I got an idea.
First, we're gonna need some supplies.
A hundred and 1 0 percent, I do not agree with this.
Everybody's gotta pitch in to make this happen.
But back in the big house, the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.
Which is why we're doing it here.
If he gets caught in town, he ain't got a clue where the house is.
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.
I could have died in there, man.
Well, guess what.
I need you to do something.
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.
Well, we'II talk once you prove we can trust you.
What do I gotta do?
I want you to go back to that garden center and get everything on this list.
And gas up the car.
And we'II meet you right back here in an hour.
-AII right.
-And, David don't screw this up.
This ain't Fox River no more, man.
You're looking at the real deal now.
But I want my cut.
Be back in an hour.
Let's go.
Mistake.
Big mistake.
Oh, come on, now.
Am I glad to see you.
You walk here?
No, it's just a Iong story, man.
I thought you were meeting up with your family.
I met a few roadblocks.
And you?
Yeah.
Well, Iet me guess.
You're going to Tooele.
Yeah.
Well, looks like we're going the same direction.
Hopefully, we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey, look I'II make it worth your while.
We've got some good news, sir.
We got our first tip on Patoshik.
Spotted at a burger joint in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.
Hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is Utah and D.B. Cooper.
Got it.
Lyle.
There's a guy listed as having the only D.B. Cooper bill ever found.
-Harold Jenkins.
-Yeah.
D.B. bought gas from Jenkins with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.
We checked the serial numbers and they matched.
You worked the case?
Fresh out of the academy and nobody's cracked it yet.
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.
Jenkins from the gas station, he still alive?
Should be.
He was only 1 8 at the time.
Well, Iet's go say hi to him.
We're sorry, that call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and dial again.
Do you have updates on Sara Tancredi?
I assume that's why you're here.
Yes.
Scofield sent her a message through the mail.
A phone number that was disconnected.
You know, to be honest I was expecting to brief the president.
Yeah, about that.
Right now, as you can imagine, Caroline's quite busy.
She's always been busy.
I've been working with her for 1 5 years.
Paul she's the president of the Unites States now.
Yes, Bill and I helped to put her there.
Well, if you'd Iike for her to remain in office you'II take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.
I wanna talk to her.
You report to me now, and only me.
Don't try and contact Caroline again without my approval and don't show up here unannounced.
Finish the job you were given.
Get Burrows.
If you're telling me the road to him leads through Sara Tancredi, by all means pursue it.
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away we'II go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.
Now, do you have anything else on Sara?
The president has unwavering faith in you.
She wants you to go through Senate approval with your eyes wide open.
-So what are we up against?
-Key allies in the House and Senate are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Sommerville.
-Counting on them to sway the middle.
-Who's the opposition?
Senators blake and Killoren have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.
Any indication as to why?
Political payback for the president's vote on the energy bill last month.
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.
-Dad.
Lance, this is my father, Frank.
-pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's nothing to lose sleep over.
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address are the charges facing your daughter.
Governor, are you with me?
Absolutely.
Yo, just chill, dog.
Listen once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'II drop a dime and they'II find you.
Just be quiet.
Just chill, man.
Woody?
Where you at?
Woody?
I need Sheriff Williams.
Yeah, I'II hold.
Woody?
Where'd you learn about electricity?
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.
Then I'd sell them on the docks, make a few bucks.
You were in school, of course.
I was just looking, pretty.
What's that old chestnut?
I can look at the menu, doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
-That's it.
-No, absolutely.
We're good.
Now, it's just up to the kid.
-Did you get everything?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
-What?
-Nothing.
It's cool.
I handled it.
-What?
-Whoa.
Okay.
Check it.
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady, he got a bad vibe so he picked up his cellie phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.
-What?
!
-I hit him with the shovel, man.
I didn't know what else to do.
I tied him up and I put him in the back room with that other country hick.
-Here we go.
Here we go.
-I came through, you gimp.
-Who was he calling?
-The sheriff.
Man, I don't know, dude.
It just set off so quick.
-Did the call go through?
-Maybe, man.
I don't know.
Maybe?
Did the call go through?
Yes, I-
- No, I don't know.
I don't know, man.
Yo, but I got the gear.
We gotta move on this now.
Yes?
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.
Right here.
alexander Mahone, FBI.
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.
What the hell else does she want?
I'm not here about that.
-What are you here for?
-D.B. Cooper.
People still wanna know about that guy?
Unbelievable.
You worked the gas station in American Fork where he filled up.
Yeah.
Normal-Iooking guy.
Barely said a word.
There were some discrepancies in the statement you filed 30 years ago.
In the report, it's noted that you said he filled up at 7 a.m but on another occasion, you said it was 7 p.m.
-Which was it?
-Both.
He gassed up twice?
Yeah.
Full tanks both times?
Yeah.
Why?
A systems what?
It's a systems diagnostics test.
Footage from our gopher cam picked up exactly where your line was corrupted.
And who corrupted it?
-You guys?
-Maybe.
AII I know is my supervisor called and said he wants me and my crew to get over here and fix that problem double quick, double time.
-So you're not with the electric company?
-No, ma'am.
Now, feel free to call your company.
But I tell you, all they'II do is send over some tech.
Maybe tomorrow, if you're lucky.
And he'II spend a whole day trying to find the problem and another day trying to fix it.
But we're here right now.
And we're ready to turn your juice back on.
My juice?
That's right.
And that's your crew?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving a 1 965 Chevy Nova.
There's no record on file that Cooper even had a car.
But Charles Westmoreland did and the car registered to him at the time was a 1 965 Chevy Nova with a 1 6-gallon gas tank.
Back then, a Chevy that size got approximately eight miles to the gallon.
D.B. stopped at the station in American Fork and gassed up once early that day and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico, which is a straight shot south drive off the main road for an all-day detour?
-The money.
-Exactly.
Cooper, Westmoreland, jumped out of a plane with $5 million.
But Westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that magic marker.
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them, I wanna know about it.
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well, who's gonna pay for this and what about the cleanup and the repair?
Well, the company will cover all costs.
We'II just dig a small trench.
Once we're finished, we'II re-Iay the cement.
It'II look as good as new.
How long is it gonna take?
One way or another, we'II be out of here today.
Really need to get started, ma'am.
Wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting in the dark tonight, now, would we?
Well, that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
Fine.
It's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.
You might wanna take in that tennis game after all.
Oh, no, it's too hot for that now.
plus, I gotta keep an eye on you all and make sure you don't steal anything.
Ma'am.
-How are you?
-Good.
AII right, where's Tweener?
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.
-We're gonna have to cut up the cement.
-Yo, we gots company.
What's up, snowflake?
Well, as always, your timing is flawless.
-I don't follow.
-Well, Iet me try to explain it to you.
We're trying to run something here and we can't have people walking in off the street.
Oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?
Sucre, I know you trust me and you know I'II cut you in on that money.
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute, hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in, you say no then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
And then you decide to play nice and then we're one big happy family.
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
And kicking, homeboy.
How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications for Uncle Sam all over the world--
How are you guys doing?
Who are you?
Who are they?
I had to call my supervisor.
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.
They want to get this done as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
Well, Jeanette, Iike I said, there's a Iot of work to do and it's gonna be noisy.
Oh, drinks.
I forgot to ask.
We're good.
Thanks.
Yo, man, this is not good.
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.
The boy is right.
And since I can't dig, I'II volunteer to keep her occupied.
You don't touch her.
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.
I'II be watching.
Billy?
Is that you?
Billy, is that you?
Yeah.
Thank you kindly.
Well, now, how did you get out of working?
Union rules.
One crew member always has to supervise.
I'II check on them in a bit.
Lemonade?
Little more ice?
Yeah.
And I Iike mine with a Iittle oomph.
But since you're on the clock I guess you can't join me?
Just two fingers.
AII right.
It's been a while.
Yeah?
Whiskey always makes me feel irascible.
I don't know what that means.
But I do like the sound of it.
Are you wearing Angel perfume?
I am.
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.
Yeah.
Now, is that good memories or bad memories?
Both.
Did you talk to Maricruz?
I don't wanna talk about her.
I gotta get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre down the road, if you're in trouble, Europeangoldfinch.net.
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
-What's it called?
-Europeangoldfinch.net.
That's a bird, right?
I got something.
-It's the silo's foundation.
-Hells, yeah.
Thank you, Charles.
We just need to find the edge and dig underneath it.
We'II get the money, hit the back roads.
What's wrong?
We got to stop in Tooele first and gas up our ride.
I thought you already did that.
Man, when the garden center thing happened, I just forgot, all right?
I want you to go back into town.
I want you to gas up that car because I'm not driving around with millions of dollars in the trunk.
-Do you understand?
-Man, why do I got to do it?
Okay.
Okay.
I better check in on our friend.
You got it all the time.
Miss Tinsel toes.
Billy?
Billy?
Yeah?
I made you a sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
Just like you Iike.
I'm so glad you came back.
I don't wanna say I told you so, but that was just not the girl for you.
Where is that?
Where's what, sweetheart?
That painting.
It's Holland, where I grew up.
You know that.
-It's beautiful.
-Oh, there's no place better.
It's so peaceful so protected from this crazy world.
-Operator.
-Hello, operator.
There's an intruder in my house.
Hello, ma 'am?
Ma 'am, are you there?
Is anyone there?
Heard you had some activity in Tooele today.
A bit.
Don't see how it warrants a visit from the FBI.

-Am I getting that right?
-Yes, sir.
And then here, the owner's girlfriend reports him missing and then his buddy comes by to check it out and he goes missing too.
Woody and Chet have been known to drop everything and go boar hunting when the opportunity arises.
And they don't tell their old ladies.
Mr. Mahone, I'II bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.
His dad will be showing up soon with the keys and you can look for yourself.
Whoa, what are you doing?
Mr. Mahone.
They're here.
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.
Who's there?
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
-Can you tell me what happened?
-There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.
A long bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her do her routine.
She'd rub her lotion on, comb her hair dress up in her nighttime fineries.
Oh, you're killing me.
She had this spot on her neck right here.
Gave her goose bumps every time.
And that perfume....
My ex, he was an accountant.
He was really buttoned up.
It was wham, bam, thank you, Sam.
Well, shame on him.
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?
Just went our separate ways.
Do you know what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?
Do tell.
Get back on the bike.
Whatever bike it is.
Amen to that.
Speaking of could you do something for me?
I'm certain of it.
Come here.
Only, you have to be very discreet.
They don't come any discreeter.
You know that big guy?
The strong guy that doesn't speak much?
Would you go in there and ask him if he would Iike to have a drink with me after he punches out?

You've just been playing me this whole time, haven't you?
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Would you just go in and ask your friend?

-Hey, Dad.
-Sara, I've been trying to reach you.
Uh, yeah, I've been meeting with my defense attorneys all day.
-You in Washington?
-Yeah, I'm coming back on the next flight.
-I thought you're gonna be there for a while.
-No, plan's changed.
Sara, you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?
I want you to stay away from him.
Who, Lance from my group?
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.
I found out some other things too.
-What are you talking about?
-You were right.
-Sara?
-I gotta go.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
-Yo.
-Just one second, sir.
Thank you.
-Can I help you?
-Just put 40 on three.
I'm sorry, what pump was that?
-Three.
-That one's been sticking.
-Okay.
Then, I'II move the car.
-No.
No, don't trouble yourself.
I'II have the mechanic come out and pump it for you.
I've got a customer waiting on three.
-AII right, I'II be right there.
-I'm in a hurry, all right?
Oh, he'II be right out.
Just one second.
Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.
-Oh, God.
-Drop!
Where are they?
What?
What?
Where are they?
Hey, man, one hand or not, I think hillbilly needs to be up in here digging.
What you think?
Good man.
What the hell are you doing up here?
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.
-I apologize for barging in.
-Don't bother.
She's got the hots for the big strong one.
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
We're gonna get back to work now.
No, I think y'all are done.
And I think y'all need to leave now.
We're almost finished.
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.
Sucre, check it out.
Cop.
Oh, thank God.
-Where you going?
-T-Bag, Iet her go!
Oh, God.
She's our only way out of this, pretty.
Don't say a word, you old whore, or I'm gonna cut your throat out.
STOP.
I CAN'T SLEEP.
NO SHIT.
I JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT DEATH.
OH, JESUS, NOT AGAIN.
I'M 38.
I'M ALMOST HALFWAY THERE AT BEST.
PLEASE.
JUST GO TO SLEEP.
OKAY.
I MEAN, I'M REALLY FUCKING SCARED OF DYING,
OF JUST BEING NOTHING FOREVER.
I'M GOING TO NOT EXIST WAY LONGER THAN I'VE EXISTED,
AND WHEN I PICTURE THAT I CAN'T BREATHE.
I'M JUST PARALYZED.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP, ARE YOU?
I SAW THIS DOG TODAY, HE WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET,
AND I THOUGHT, "THAT DOG IS GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IT.
HE'S SO LUCKY."
OR IS HE?
IS IT BETTER THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW OR THAT HE DOES KNOW?
FUCKING DOG.
I JUST WISH THERE WERE SOME WAY--
( gasps )
( moaning )
ARE YOU STILL THINKING ABOUT DEATH?
NO.
NO.
NO.
Louis C.K.:
"LUCKY LOUIE" WAS TAPED BEFORE A LIVE AUDIENCE.
PLEASE EAT SOMETHING.
I DOT REALLY CARE FOR IT.
CAN I HAVE DESSERT?
YEAH, WHY NOT?

HUH...
APPARENTLY, THERE'S LIKE A TAILGATE PARTY TOO.
I DON'T KNOW.

( both laugh )
YEAH, IT DOES.
SO ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT TO GO?
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I SHOULD-

--'CAUSE IS A WORK THING.
AND MIKE IS MY BOSS, AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO NETWORK.
SO YOU THINK I SHOULD GO?
OH MY GOD, YES, GO.
WHATEVER.

WHAT?
DON'T TELL HIM THAT.
THIS IS NOT ME NOT LETTING YOU GO.
OH, I GUESS SHE IS LETTING ME GO.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME.
I'VE GOT TO CALL YOU BACK.
AM I GOING OR NOT?
YOU NEED ME TO TELL YOU?
I WORKED ALL DAY,
LUCY'S SICK AND YOU WANT TO GO TO A TAILGATE PARTY.
SO YOU'RE NOT LETTING ME GO?
( sigh ) NO, I'M NOT DOING THIS.
- WHAT?
- THIS,
THAT THING WHERE YOU FORCE ME TO MAKE THE DECISION FOR YOU,
AND I'M THE BAD GUY.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU'RE AN ADULT.
MAKE A DECISION AND LIVE WITH IT.
YOU WANT ME TO DECIDE?
THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT?
THAT'D BE GREAT.
ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME RIGHT NOW?
JESUS CHRIST.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO DECIDE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.
Kim:
UH-HUH.
OKAY.
HERE'S THE DECISION:
I'M GOING, AND I'M GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.
BYE.
WHOO!
- ( car horn honks ) - ( sings team song )

HOW GREAT WAS IT WHEN THEY WENT TO THE ZONE DEFENSE,
AND SHUT THOSE UGLY BITCHES OUT FOR EIGHT MINUTES?

TAKING IT HARD TO THE HOLE, HUH?
MIKE, MIKE, MIKE, SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.
CHECK THESE GUYS OUT.
( lisping ) EXCUSE ME, FELLAS.
WE'RE A LITTLE LOST.
COULD YOU GIVE US ERECTIONS?
"ERECTIONS"?
COME ON, MAN.
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW THESE GUYS ARE GAY?
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GAY.
I'M PRETENDING THAT I'M GAY.
IT'S FUNNY TO ACT GAY.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, LOU?
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY IT.
HERE, CHECK THESE GUYS OUT OVER HERE.
( lisping ) EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN, YES.
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET TO SYCAMORE STREET?
Man:
GO TO THE LIGHT AND MAKE A LEFT.
OH, THANKS.

( laughs )
HEY, MAN, ARE YOU OKAY TO DRIVE?
NOT IN THE LEAST.
WELL, HERE LET ME DRIVE.

USE THAT TO MAKE YOUR CALL.
SO...
THIS IS WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TGET FUCKED IN THE ASS.
ALL RIGHT.
I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TELL KIM WHAT HAPPENED.
( ringing )
HELLO.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
- OH, HI.

I'M JUST CALLING BECAUSE I FEEL REALLY BAD THAT I LEFT YOU THERE.
I JUST-
- I JUST REALLY WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M SORRY.
YEAH, OKAY.
NO, REALLY.
I JUST FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE
AND I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU A BREAK, AND I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
LISTEN, COULD YOU COME PICK ME UP?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, COME PICK YOU UP?
IT'S JUST THAT I'M DOWNTOWN
AND I'VE GOT TO GET HOME.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU NEED ME FOR?
I DON'T HAVE A CAR.
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT IT'S JUST THAT I'M IN A PLACE WHERE
IN ORDER FOR ME TO LEAVE, THEY NEED YOU TO GIVE THEM...
BAIL.
YOU'RE IN JAIL?
YEAH, I GOT BUSTED FOR A D.U.I. I'M SORRY.
( sighs ) YOU'RE ONLY SORRY BECAUSE YOU'RE IN JAIL.
WELL, THAT'S THE POINT OF JAIL.
SO, CAN YOU COME GET ME?
HMM.
IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE HERE.
DO I WAKE UP SICK LUCY
AND PUT HER ON A BUS TO COME BAIL YOU OUT,
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO DRINK YOUR FACE OFF AT A BASKETBALL GAME,
OR DO I LET YOU SLEEP FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS ON A JAIL FLOOR?
SO WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
GOOD NIGHT, LOUIE.
SHIT.
DO YOU WANT TO CALL TINA?
YEAH, SURE.
WHY NOT?
( clears throat )
( ringing )
- HELLO.
- Hey, honey.
I'M IN JAIL ON A D.U.I.
HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, I WAS SWERVING ALL OVER THE PLACE,
THEN LOUIE JUMPED ON MY LAP.
( chuckles IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS HAD FUN.
ANYWAY, LISTEN.
I'M GOING TO SLEEP IT OFF HERE
AND I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, OKAY?
ALL RIGHT.
BYE, POOP.
OH, WELL.
HEY, YOU'D BETTER MOVE OVER.
I'VE GOT PRETTY BAD AIM.
GOOD MORNING.
OH, HI.
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MY NIGHT IN JAIL?
NOT REALLY.
ARE YOU EVEN CURIOUS IF I GOT RAPED?
'CAUSE I GOT RAPED.
LOUIE, I'M SICK.
I THINK I GOT WHATEVER LUCY HAD,
SO JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED AND LET ME GO LIE DOWN.
WELL, I GOT A $1,000 FINE,
AND I'VE GOT TO GO TO A.A.
AWESOME.
HI, PAPA.
HEY, SWEETHEART.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
GOOD.
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?
I WAS IN JAIL.
WHAT'S JAIL?
IT'S A PLACE WHERE THEY PUT BAD PEOPLE.
ARE YOU A BAD PERSON?
NO, I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.
THEN WHY DID THEY PUT YOU IN JAIL?
'CAUSE I'M A BAD PERSON.
DO YOU WANT A COOKIE?
- OKAY.
- OKAY, I'M GOING TO HAVE ONE TOO.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A COOKIE 'CAUSE YOU WERE BAD.
HEY, LOUIE.
HEY, MIKE.
HEY, JERRY.
YOU COME HERE?
YEAH, THIS IS MY WEDNESDAY MEETING.
IT'S GOOD YOU'RE HERE,
AND DON'T WORRY-- ANONYMOUS.
( laughs )
YEAH, THANKS.
HI, WELCOME, GUYS.
I'M LEADING TONIGHT.
MY NAME'S JEFF.
- HEY.
- HI.
HEY, CAN YOU SIGN THIS FOR US,
SO WE CAN PROVE THAT WE WERE HERE?
THIS IS AN ATTENDANCE FORM.
I DON'T SIGN THIS UNTIL THE MEETING'S OVER.
OH, WE'RE NOT ALCOHOLICS.
WE'RE JUST HERE BECAUSE WE GOT A D.U.I.
MAYBE YOU COULD JUST SIGTHIS SO WE CAN LEAVE.
GUYS, I KNOW IT MUST BE HARD TO ADMIT THAT
YOU MIGHT BENEFIT FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
BUT WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?
AN HOUR?
YEAH, AN HOUR.
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.
THANK YOU.
OKAY.
OKAY, ALL, LET'S GET STARTED.
MY NAME'S JEFF, AND I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.
All:
HI, JEFF.
FIVE YEARS AGO, I WAS AN AIRLINE PILOT.
DAY AFTER 12 VODKA TONICS,
I FLEW A PLANE TO LOS ANGELES.
THE PROBLEM IS MY DESTINATION WAS SAN DIEGO.
BUT THEN I STARTED WORKING THE STEPS,
AND TODAY, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I'VE GOT MY 18-MONTH CHIP
AND I'M AN ASSISTANT MANAGER AT WAL-MART.
HAS IT BEEN AN HOUR YET?
YEAH, I'M CAL.
All:
HEY, CAL.
I'M WHAT YOU CALL A BLACKOUT DRUNK,
SO SOMETIMES I'D WAKE UP FIVE STATES AWAY
FROM WHERE I STARTED DRINKING.
AND I'D BE MARRIED,
OFTEN WHILE I WAS ALREADY MARRIED.
I NEVER EVEN TOUCHED ALCOHOL UNTIL I MET THIS GIRL AT THE BEACH.
PATTY.
GOD, SHE WAS SOMETHING.
- CAL?
- ANYWAY...
GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
ONE DAY AT A TIME.
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO BE THAT SACK OF SHIT?
GUYS, NO CROSSTALK PLEASE.
- I'M JERRY.
- All:
HEY, JERRY.
FOUR YEARS SOBER.
I ENJOY DATING SENIOR CITIZENS.
SO ONE DAY CLAIRE AND I,
WE'RE SITTING ON A PARK BENCH
AND WE'RE MAKING OUT.
AND SHE FALLS ASLEEP,
SO I START RIFLING THROUGH HER PURSE,
'CAUSE I WANT MONEY FOR BOOZE.
BUT I REALIZE THAT JERRY DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT JERRY
WHEN JERRY'S DOING THIS.
THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED
TO STOP DRINKING AND START THINKING.
AND TODAY WHEN I DATE THOSE OLD LADIES,
I DON'T STEAL THEIR MONEY, SO I'M A WINNER.
( Jerry laughs )
WELL, AT LEAST THAT WAS ENTERTAINING.
SERIOUSLY, NO CROSSTALK.
JESUS, THIS GUY REALLY HATES CROSSTALK.
YOU KNOW WHAT, MIKE?
YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE ABOVE THIS.
YOU SAY YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
NO, NOT REALLY.
WELL THEN, TELL US ABOUT IT.
TELL US HOW DRINKING HAS MADE YOUR LIFE SO GREAT.
OKAY...
I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.
WELL, I GUESS THE MAIN THING IS THAT WHEN I FEEL BAD...
I DRINK, AND I DON'T FEEL BAD ANYMORE.
AND WHEN I FEEL GOOD...
I DRINK...
AND I FEEL BETTER.
BUT, I KNOW I DRINK A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH SOMETIMES--
WAY TOO MUCH-- AND THE NEXT DAY I DON'T FEEL GOOD.
I GET THE RUNS.
I'VE GOT TO POP A LOT OF ASPIRIN,
MAYBE TAKE A HALF-DAY, BUT, YOU KNOW,
HEY, BIG WHOOP, HUH?
BEING DRUNK IS FUN!
MY NAME IS MIKE, AND THANKS FOR LISTENING.
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE THAT.
OKAY, APPARENTLY, THESE GUYS HAVEN'T LEARNED ANYTHING TODAY.
WELL, I LEARNED SOMETHING.
OH, REALLY?
WELL, LET'S HEAR THAT.
IT'S KIND OF PERSONAL.
WELL, YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.
IT FELT GOOD TO SHARE MY STORY.
YEAH, GO AHEAD, LOUIE, YOU'RE IN A SAFE PLACE.
YEAH, COME ON.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
I GUESS I'M RELATING TO A LOT OF YOUR STORIES.
I MEAN, YOU GUYS ALL MADE SOME REALLY BAD DECISIONS
'CAUSE YOU WERE DRUNK.
WELL, LAST NIGHT I DECIDED TO GO TO A WOMEN'S BASKETBALL GAME
INSTEAD OF TAKING CARE OF MY SICK DAUGHTER.
THAT WAS A BAD DECISION.
THE THING IS, I WAS STONE-COLD SOBER.
HONESTLY, I WISH THAT ALCOHOL WERE MY PROBLEM.
GOD, THAT'D BE GREAT.
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, I'M NOT AN ALCOHOLIC,
I'M JUST A FUCKING ASSHOLE.
YOU KNOW, I MADE A LOT OF BAD DECISIONS BEFORE I DRANK TOO.
MAYBE I'M JUST A FUCKING ASSHOLE.
YEAH, I THINK I'M A FUCKING ASSHOLE TOO.
EVERYBODY, PLEASE,
THIS IS JUST THE ADDICT TALKING.
AH, COME ON, JEFF.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE.
HEY, WE'RE ALL FUCKING ASSHOLES, EH?
AND THIS FUCKING ASSHOLE
IS BUYING ALL YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES...
DRINKS.
COME ON.
( door closes )
- HI.
- HEY.
UH, LISTEN.
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING.
I HAD KIND OF A BREAKTHROUGH.
I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO BE AN ADULT
AND MAKE DECISIONS FOR MYSELF.
RIGHT.
WELL, THAT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
THAT'S YOUR BREAKTHROUGH?
YEAH, LOOK, I-
- I TRIED, BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE YOU.
BUT HERE'S WHAT I'LL GIVE YOU IN RETURN.
I WON'T COMPLAIN ANYMORE OR-
- OR MAKE YOU THE BAD GUY.
JUST WHATEVER YOU DECIDE, I'LL JUST DO IT.
NO.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO?
NO, YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS.
BUT I MADE ONE DECISION-
- IT WAS A TOTAL DISASTER.
SURE IT WAS.
IT WAS AWFUL.
I MEAN, I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE BAD,
BUT WOW.
YES, SO STOP ME BEFORE I DO THAT AGAIN.
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN LUCY DECIDED TO PUT GLUE IN HER HAIR?
SHE WAS BALD FOR A WHILE.
BUT NOW SHE KNOWS THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.
THAT'S HOW YOU LEARN.
OKAY, YOU'RE 37,
SO YOU'RE STARTING A LITTLE BIT LATE.
BUT YOU'LL BE FINE.
AND YOU'RE ALREADY BALD.
SO...
I CAN MAKE ANY DECISIONS I WANT
AND YOU WON'T COMPLAIN?
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
?
?
we have lot of fun tonight
?
but i thought
?
when
?
there're fun
?
there're
?
and
?
Stop.
I can't sleep.
No shit.
I just keep thinking about death.
Oh, Jesus, not again.
I'm 38.
I'm almost halfway there at best.
Please.
Just go to sleep.
Okay.
I mean, I'm really fucking scared of dying, of just being nothing forever.
I'm going to not exist way longer than I've existed, and when I picture that I can't breathe.
I'm just paralyzed.
You're not going to stop, are you?
I saw this dog today, he was walking down the street, and I thought, "That dog is going to die someday and he doesn't even know it.
He's so lucky."
Or is he?
Is it better that he doesn't know or that he does know?
Fucking dog.
I just wish there were some way...
Are you still thinking about death?
No.
No.
No.
"Lucky Louie" was taped before a live audience.
Please eat something.
I don't really care for it.
Can I have dessert?
Yeah, why not?
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi, Mama.
- Hi, baby.
Oh my God, what a horrible day.
You remember Pete, my morbidly obese patient?
It took two hours to move him.
- Where did you have to move him?
- The morgue.
My back is killing me.
Oh, don't give her that yet.
She's barely eaten anything.
Yeah, Papa.
I've barely eaten anything.
- Hello?
- What's up, pumpkin?
Are you going to Lady Bulldog's game tonight or what?
Aw, is that tonight?
- I don't think I can go.
- What?
You're going to miss the Women's College Basketball Division III finals?
What kind of a sports fan are you?
No, you're right,
I should go.
You know what?
I'll be there.
I've just got to clear it with Kim.
Well, get it cleared.
Tailgate party starts at 6:30.
I don't want to miss the pep rally.
Hang on.
Tina's got something.
Now, Louie, I know you guys are going to be out late and there's
- going to be a lot of drinking.
- Yeah, probably.
Well, have a good time.
Mama, I'm cold.
Well, go get your sweater in the bedroom.
Hey, uh, it looks like the Lady Bulldogs are in the championship.
That's pretty great.
Oh, okay.
Wow.
So I guess Mike and Rich are going or something.
Oh, they're going?
Yeah, or something.
Huh...
Apparently, there's like a tailgate party too.
I don't know.
Sounds stupid.
Yeah, it does.
So are you saying you want to go?
I don't know.
Maybe I should...
right?
...'cause it's a work thing.
And Mike is my boss, and it's always good to network.
So you think I should go?
Oh my God, yes, go.
Whatever.
- Mommy?
- What, sweetie?
- My tummy hurts.
- Okay, I'll be right there.
Oh, honey.
I'm going to take her to the bathroom.
Will you deal with that?
Oh, Jeez, you going to be all right there?
Poor kid.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Where are you going?
I'm going to the game.
- Really?
- What?
You said I could go.
What are you, nine?
You're daughter just threw up.
All right, fine.
Hey, Mike, bad news, I can't go.
Yeah, the wife won't let me go.
What?
Don't tell him that.
This is not me not letting you go.
Oh, I guess she is letting me go.
What is wrong with you?
Something's wrong with me.
I've got to call you back.
Am I going or not?
You need me to tell you?
I worked all day,
Lucy's sick and you want to go to a tailgate party.
So you're not letting me go?
No, I'm not doing this.
- What?
- This, that thing where you force me to make the decision for you, and I'm the bad guy.
It's ridiculous.
You're an adult.
Make a decision and live with it.
You want me to decide?
That's really what you want?
That'd be great.
Are you fucking with me right now?
Jesus Christ.
All right.
I'm going to decide.
That's what you want me to do.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Here's the decision:
I'm going, and I'm going to have a good time.
Bye.
Whoo!
How great was it when they went to the zone defense, and shut those ugly bitches out for eight minutes?
Yeah, nothing I like better than watching a pretty young lady taking it hard to the hole, huh?
Mike, Mike, Mike, slow down, slow down.
Check these guys out.
Excuse me, fellas.
We're a little lost.
Could you give us erections?
"Erections"?
Come on, man.
How do you even know these guys are gay?
I don't think they're gay.
I'm pretending that I'm gay.
It's funny to act gay.
What's wrong with you, Lou?
All right, I'll try it.
Here, check these guys out over here.
Excuse me, gentlemen, yes.
Can you tell me how to get to Sycamore Street?
Go to the light and make a left.
Oh, thanks.
That wasn't fun.
Those guys just think I'm gay now.
Eh...
Uh-oh.
Faggot.
Mike, look out!
Jesus.
Boy, that guy's lucky to be alive.
No shit.
Hey, buddy, you almost died!
Fuck you!
Hey, man, are you okay to drive?
Not in the least.
Well, here let me drive.
Pull over, let's switch.
No no, let go.
I don't like anyone else driving when I'm drunk.
Come on, man.
That's stupid.
Let me drive.
Just pull over.
Come on.
All right.
Fine.
You want to drive?
Let's switch.
Go ahead.
Switch.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Shit.
Ah!
Ah!
You're on my dick!
Lift up so I can slide under.
I can't.
I trapped between the dashboard and your dick.
Ah!
Push the fucking seat back.
Ow!
Legroom, faggots!
Ugh.
Oh, shit.
Well, pull over, asshole, you've got the wheel.
Would you let him go, Officer?
It was my car.
You were both driving.
You both failed the Breathalyzer.
You both get to go to jail.
Use that to make your call.
So... this is where I'm supposed to get fucked in the ass.
All right.
I've got to figure out how to tell Kim what happened.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
- Oh, hi.
- Listen, uh...
I'm just calling because I feel really bad that I left you there.
I just...
I just really wanted to say that I'm sorry.
Yeah, okay.
No, really.
I just feel like I should have been responsible and I should have given you a break, and I hope you can forgive me.
It's all right.
Thank you.
Listen, could you come pick me up?
What do you mean, come pick you up?
It's just that I'm downtown and I've got to get home.
Well, what do you need me for?
I don't have a car.
Yeah, I know, but it's just that I'm in a place where in order for me to leave, they need you to give them... bail.
You're in jail?
Yeah, I got busted for a D.U.I. I'm sorry.
You're only sorry because you're in jail.
Well, that's the point of jail.
So, can you come get me?
Hmm.
It looks like I have a decision to make here.
Do I wake up sick Lucy and put her on a bus to come bail you out, because you had to drink your face off at a basketball game, or do I let you sleep for a couple of hours on a jail floor?
So which one are you going to do?
Good night, Louie.
Shit.
Do you want to call Tina?
Yeah, sure.
Why not?
- Hello.
- Hey, honey.
I'm in jail on a D.U.I.
Honey, are you okay?
What happened?
Well, I was swerving all over the place, then Louie jumped on my lap.
It sounds like you guys had fun.
Anyway, listen.
I'm going to sleep it off here and I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
All right.
Bye, poop.
Oh, well.
Hey, you'd better move over.
I've got pretty bad aim.
Good morning.
Oh, hi.
Don't you want to know about my night in jail?
Not really.
Are you even curious if I got raped?
'Cause I got raped.
Louie, I'm sick.
I think I got whatever Lucy had, so just tell me what happened and let me go lie down.
Well, I got a $1,000 fine, and I've got to go to A.A.
Awesome.
Hi, Papa.
Hey, sweetheart.
How are you feeling?
Good.
Where were you last night?
I was in jail.
What's jail?
It's a place where they put bad people.
Are you a bad person?
No, I'm not a bad person.
Then why did they put you in jail?
'Cause I'm a bad person.
Do you want a cookie?
- Okay.
- Okay, I'm going to have one too.
You shouldn't have a cookie 'cause you were bad.
Hey, Louie.
Hey, Mike.
Hey, Jerry.
You come here?
Yeah, this is my Wednesday meeting.
It's good you're here, and don't worry...
anonymous.
Yeah, thanks.
Hi, welcome, guys.
I'm leading tonight.
My name's Jeff.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hey, can you sign this for us, so we can prove that we were here?
This is an attendance form.
I don't sign this until the meeting's over.
Oh, we're not alcoholics.
We're just here because we got a D.U.I.
Maybe you could just sign this so we can leave.
Guys, I know it must be hard to admit that you might benefit from something like this, but what have you got to lose?
An hour?
Yeah, an hour.
All right, we'll give it a shot.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay, all, let's get started.
My name's Jeff, and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Jeff.
Five years ago, I was an airline pilot.
One day after 12 vodka tonics,
I flew a plane to Los Angeles.
The problem is my destination was San Diego.
But then I started working the Steps, and today, by the grace of God, I've got my 18-month chip and I'm an Assistant Manager at Wal-Mart.
Has it been an hour yet?
Yeah, I'm Cal.
Hey, Cal.
I'm what you call a blackout drunk, so sometimes I'd wake up five states away from where I started drinking.
And I'd be married, often while I was already married.
I never even touched alcohol until I met this girl at the beach.
Patty.
God, she was something.
- Cal?
- Anyway...
God bless you all.
One day at a time.
How'd you like to be that sack of shit?
Guys, no crosstalk please.
- I'm Jerry.
- Hey, Jerry.
Four years sober.
I enjoy dating senior citizens.
So one day Claire and I, we're sitting on a park bench and we're making out.
And she falls asleep, so I start rifling through her purse, 'cause I want money for booze.
But I realize that Jerry don't feel good about Jerry when Jerry's doing this.
That's when I decided to stop drinking and start thinking.
And today when I date those old ladies,
I don't steal their money, so I'm a winner.
Well, at least that was entertaining.
Seriously, no crosstalk.
Jesus, this guy really hates crosstalk.
You know what, Mike?
You act like you're above this.
You say you don't have a problem.
No, not really.
Well then, tell us about it.
Tell us how drinking has made your life so great.
Okay...
I'll give it a shot.
Well, I guess the main thing is that when I feel bad...
I drink, and I don't feel bad anymore.
And when I feel good...
I drink... and I feel better.
But, I know I drink a little bit too much sometimes... way too much...
and the next day I don't feel good.
I get the runs.
I've got to pop a lot of aspirin, maybe take a half-day, but, you know, hey, big whoop, huh?
Being drunk is fun!
My name is Mike, and thanks for listening.
I never thought about it like that.
Okay, apparently, these guys haven't learned anything today.
Well, I learned something.
Oh, really?
Well, let's hear that.
It's kind of personal.
Well, you should give it a try.
It felt good to share my story.
Yeah, go ahead, Louie, you're in a safe place.
Yeah, come on.
Well, all right.
I guess I'm relating to a lot of your stories.
I mean, you guys all made some really bad decisions 'cause you were drunk.
Well, last night I decided to go to a women's basketball game instead of taking care of my sick daughter.
That was a bad decision.
The thing is, I was stone-cold sober.
Honestly, I wish that alcohol were my problem.
God, that'd be great.
But, unfortunately, I'm not an alcoholic,
I'm just a fucking asshole.
You know, I made a lot of bad decisions before I drank too.
Maybe I'm just a fucking asshole.
Yeah, I think I'm a fucking asshole too.
Everybody, please, this is just the addict talking.
Ah, come on, Jeff.
You know you're a fucking asshole.
Hey, we're all fucking assholes, eh?
And this fucking asshole is buying all you fucking assholes... drinks.
Come on.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Uh, listen.
I'm really sorry about everything.
I had kind of a breakthrough.
I know you want me to be an adult and make decisions for myself.
Right.
Well, that ain't gonna happen.
That's your breakthrough?
Yeah, look, I...
I tried, but it didn't work.
I think it's going to have to be you.
But here's what I'll give you in return.
I won't complain anymore or... or make you the bad guy.
Just whatever you decide, I'll just do it.
No.
What do you mean no?
No, you still have to make your own decisions.
But I made one decision...
it was a total disaster.
Sure it was.
It was awful.
I mean, I knew it was going to be bad, but wow.
Yes, so stop me before I do that again.
Do you remember when Lucy decided to put glue in her hair?
She was bald for a while.
But now she knows that was a bad idea.
That's how you learn.
Okay, you're 37, so you're starting a little bit late.
But you'll be fine.
And you're already bald.
So...
I can make any decisions I want and you won't complain?
Get the fuck out of here.
Oh, hello.
I'm Rick Shapiro of the "Lucky Louie" television program.
We all had a lot of fun tonight, but at the heart of this show is a serious issue.
When considering sexual partners, don't overlook the elderly.
They're fun.
They're appreciative.
And hey, you don't have to worry about birth control.
The elderly, they're not dead yet.
What's all this fuzz about cats?
Halvorsen and I often wonder why people are so taken with cats.
And dogs.
Other animals could be just as great pets.
Pigs, for instance.
And snakes.
Turtles.
Rats ...
Halvorsen is my pet.
He is a rat.
A hooded rat.
He is intelligent, good looking and cool.
No!
His only problem is that he likes chewing at things.
This is bound to get him into trouble some day.
Svein, the field trip is in five minutes!
You wouldn't be interested in this trip.
That's for sure.
Are you stuck in there?
I don't want to join that crappy trip!
Other classes go to chocolate factories.
But we're going to find out what happens to our poop!
Based on the books by Marit Nicolaysen
No wonder people are terrible to each other.
Just look at what ugly poop we're making.
Yuk!
How disgusting!
Step this way, folks!
Whereas rats just drop small, dry pellets.
They're not disgusting at all.
Human beings have a lot to learn from rats.
Welcome to the sewage.
The museum of poop.
The last resting place of the turd.
The sewage.
A fabulous place.
We love crap.
Look.
A rat!
I hate rats!
Hate them!
Svein and Dan keep rats.
As pets.
People who keep rats as pets, are very sick people!
Rats are vermin!
They have to be extinguished!
He should rather have a look in the mirror!
Death to the rats!
That man is literally bursting with prejudice.
Nobody screams and shouts and says yuk when they see a cat.
Even though they pee everywhere.
And poo.
They also smell terribly.
Hi there, rat faces!
Dan's rat is called James Bond.
Dan is a rat scientist.
Maybe nobody in the world knows as much about rats.
Right now we're on the verge of a scientific breakthrough.
-Ready?
-Yes.
Svein and Dan's experiment no. 442.
Are human beings able to hear rats laugh?
Tickle, tickle ...
Come on, laugh!
Tickle him harder.
Turn up the volume to 11 .
Halvorsen is a family member.
Mum overprotects him all the time.
But Halvorsen knows how to take care of himself.
Daddy tries to teach him good manners.
Just like with us.
Which is also an impossible task.
My kid brother Magnus is the only one who treats him as an animal.
But he is only five, and extremely primitive.
Cut it out, Magnus!
Now you've probably scared Halvorsen away!
Halvorsen!
I've never heard of rats entering the sewage from toilets.
There are hordes of sewage rats down there!
Halvorsen doesn't stand a chance!
Zero combat training!
Oh, Halvorsen...
There you are!
If you'd seen how thousands of rats live in this town...
Then you'd have nightmares for weeks.
What did we agree on with these wires?
Are you aware of how much Halvorsen has cost us this year?
Are you feeding him?
Does he get any food?
Yes.
He doesn't eat wires because he is hungry.
-lt's just that...
-You don't look after him properly.
-l try my best.
-You're too young to keep a rat.
Why are people so negative towards rats?
Rats spend a third of their lives cleaning themselves.
They neither spew nor belch.
And if science is right, they can even laugh!
So that can't be the reason.
is it maybe because people just don't know any better?
Halvorsen, we have to do something.
We have to tell people the truth about rats.
Show the world how cool rats can be.
Halvorsen will love being an ambassador for the rat cause.
And I will assist him.
Nighty night, Halvorsen.
Ladies and gentlemen. ln a week it's time for the great pet contest!
Enter your pet right away.
There's only one week left.
Shouldn't we join the pet contest?
And be laughed at by a hall full of rat-haters?
I don't think so.
There's the new girl in class.
I feel that I'm a bit skeptical.
Got to go.
The school dentist is expecting me.
Didn't we have an appointment during home economics?
Halvorsen insists on going with me to home economics.
To him, it's a gourmet restaurant.
Soon there'll be piles of pancakes.
Pancakes are so great.
I could eat ten of them.
I won an eating contest once, in Spain.
-How many did you manage to eat?
-33.
-33 pancakes?
-No, not pancakes.
Marinated snails.
Yuk!
Hi kids, I'm Drummy.
You probably remember me from the sewage tour.
I'm your new substitute.
I'm going to be very popular here after a while.
I'm really a drummer.
Okay.
The first item on the menu is pancakes.
-Are you really Spanish?
-Halfways.
Mum is Spanish, Dad's Norwegian.
So I'm Spanegian.
Cool!
I'm not even halfways from another town.
At least that saves you the moving.
Does it suck to be the new girl?
-What does your rat look like?
-He's pretty cool.
-Will you let me see him?
-Maybe.
-Looking forward to the contest?
-Of course. I'll win this year too.
Me and Tiger, my cat, have won two years in a row.
The rarest animal in town.
Will you participate with your rat?
Rats are not allowed.
-Why not?
-lt's the great pet contest!
Not the great pest contest!
Hush.
Look.
Listen...
-Don't panic.
-Rats!
We continue the class!
Halvorsen...
How cute!
Nothing like those in the sewage.
Hi there, tiny one.
Lots of them.
A whole battalion in the ventilation system.
-l was...
-Hush, Drummy.
There are rats around.
Actually I've always had a problem with rats.
I was attacked once by a giant rat.
Big as a guide dog!
He bit my knee.
Then I underwent intensive rat therapy.
Psychodrama.
I had to think about a rat.
Then use my drumsticks and...
Try to be silent for just 1 0 seconds, Drummy.
That's the kind of challenge I appreciate.
Major crisis. ln 5 seconds, the headmistress discovers Halvorsen.
Then she'll start screaming.
Or.. ?
Maybe I should get ahead of her?
If you say 1 , 2...
Headmistress, this is Halvorsen.
Svein, what on earth have you done?
The headmistress is furious!
I've told you a hundred times, don't bring Halvorsen to school!
is it really necessary to get so mad?
Okay.
I realize it was stupid of me.
Guess I have to admit there are people who will never like rats.
But we can't give up now!
-May I hold him?
-Okay.
Pull in your claws, old geezer.
-ls he called Old Geezer?
-No, Halvorsen.
But he is old, actually.
The oldest in the family. 54 years.
Because one rat year only lasts ten days.
Next year he'll be 67, and a pensioner!
-That tickles.
-That means he likes you.
Just like a dog.
-Have you got a dog?
-l used to have one.
Her name was Lucky.
She had to be put away when we moved here.
Pets are not allowed in our apartment building.
Svein.
-l'll wait here.
-l have to go now.
Bye.
I really think she likes rats.
-You didn't show her Halvorsen?
-No.
Seriously, Dan.
Don't you think the contest should be open to rats?
Personally I think James Bond and Halvorsen are far too cool for it.
Dan doesn't understand that you have to take chances to achieve.
Science is fine, but of no use if the whole world still hates rats.
Thanks a million, Halvorsen!
Penalty?
That was no penalty!
Halvorsen!
The most important match this year!
If that vandal of a rat does anything like this again, it's straight out of the house.
Understood?
It's not easy to make people like you when you do stuff like that.
I really don't understand you.
Why do you do so many stupid things?
You know what will happen if you don't pull yourself together.
Hi, Melissa.
The battery doesn't last that long.
We can only listen for 20 seconds.
Does he know any tricks?
He can make a leakage in the bathroom, short-circuit the TV...
No, I mean things you have taught him.
Nice things.
Tricks.
-Did your dog know any?
-You bet!
-She could sit and lie down.
-Any dog can do that.
On command.
And she could stand on her head and walk on her hands.
Cool!
Do you think rats can learn the same tricks you taught your dog?
Of course!
I can teach Halvorsen.
I've thought about the pet contest.
No rats have entered before, so I'm not sure if they're allowed.
Have you asked?
I haven't dared to.
Of course Halvorsen will participate.
"Ladies and gentlemen.
Svein and his performing rat Halvorsen!"
What if we could use the contest to make people like rats better?
When you see what a dull doggie can do, imagine what Halvorsen could achieve, trained by Melissa!
To walk on his hands is only the beginning!
Wake up, Halvorsen.
Soon there is the prize distribution.
The winner of the great pet contest is...
The fabulous rat Halvorsen!
Thank you, thank you.
I would like to thank my best friend, Svein.
I'd like to thank you.
-Looked at the washing machine?
-Why do you nag so much about it?
There's something wrong with it.
It's leaky.
-Please look at it after dinner.
-lt's on top of my list.
Svein!
Mummy and Daddy will go nuts if they find out you did this.
It's a military device my uncle used to spy on the Germans during the Second World War.
If we could fasten the rats somewhere in here...
Then we would hear every little sound.
Looks like an ordinary cassette player.
Exactly.
That's what the Germans thought, too.
I have registered him!
I entered Halvorsen!
How did you manage?
I thought rats were not allowed.
I just asked.
They don't mind rats.
Cool!
Jerk!
Give it to me!
Jump!
Grab it!
Are you nuts?
Svein has entered Halvorsen.
He has a cool training programme.
He's going to crush your scabby cat.
Yeah, sure.
Bye, rat faces!
Dan could also participate.
Dan, wait!
I didn't know you had made friends with her.
She wanted to see Halvorsen.
I couldn't really refuse.
-She thought Halvorsen was cute.
-He's not cute.
He's cool.
Can't we enter the contest?
Melissa is an expert trainer.
James Bond isn't that competitive.
Of course he is.
He races Halvorsen all the time.
I thought we were into rats' laughter.
Why can't we do both?
Since you brought your disgusting rats, many more have appeared.
We have got ourselves a rat problem in our school!
I intend to solve the problem by putting out traps.
Maybe the two of you could assist me?
I planned to place them in the school kitchen.
What do you think?
Personally I would have started in the locker room.
I think rats love the smell of sweat.
Personally I would have started with the garage.
I think they also love the scent of gasoline.
Not in the school kitchen?
This stuff about rats and food is pretty much exaggerated.
Get going!
Come on!
It's just as much James Bond's poop.
Now, boys...
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in the gym?
What's that smell?
Rat poop, it is!
So I guess it's an advantage that I brought a few things...
This is going to finish off those creeps.
We shouldn't bring Halvorsen or James Bond to school anymore.
Even if they're not dumb enough to end up in one of those traps.
Hey!
Melissa!
Rat face!
Come on!
If you tell me poems are boring, I kind of agree.
But since rap arrived, poetry has become cool again.
It would go like, Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star...
Rap is actually poetry, just a little rougher.
Svein was going to make a poem for today.
Would you rap it for us?
-l'm not really into it today.
-Okay.
The language of youth.
A bit of stubbornness is acceptable.
Congratulations!
You are registered for the great pet contest.
Dogs, cats, birds...
"The pet of the year."
"Rats may enter the animal exhibition."
A beauty contest for animals?
"And participate in rat skills."
"There's rat race, tightrope walking," "and the extremely challenging hoop-jumping."
-Not that many alternatives.
-That means exhibition, or..?
No.
Exhibition is not right for Halvorsen.
Halvorsen will win the rat skills category.
I happpen to know an expert trainer.
Svein!
Too bad the expert trainer is not here yet.
We'd better start with my stuff.
We're extremely short of time.
The most important in tightrope walking, is to walk straight ahead.
Do not look down.
Okay.
Let's start with something more simple.
Hoop-jumping.
The important thing is just to get through the hoop.
Got it?
...and we'll call you back.
Hi, Melissa.
This is Svein.
I have to get in touch with you as soon as possible.
Where are you?
One, two, three...jump!
Jump.
Jump!
Look here, Halvorsen.
This is how it's done.
You just have to find your point of balance.
Like this.
You don't get anything until you've learned how to jump.
Poor Halvorsen.
This is no game.
But you don't understand, you're only five.
lncompetent.
Life is not only free meals and people scratching your belly.
You have to achieve something.
This contest is more important than anything else.
It's now or never.
Svein, phone call for you.
It's Melissa.
It doesn't look good.
I've broken my arm.
The gang pursued me to the woods, and then I fell.
They just ran off.
I have to stay here a few days.
-May I visit you?
-Would you like to?
I think I have to.
Bye.
I'll pick you up at school, and we'll go straight to the hospital.
-But we are going home first?
-That was the point.
We could avoid Mummy's food, and rather have a burger or so.
-What's the cat doing here?
-Rat hunting.
Are you scared of cats, maybe?
He probably notices the smell.
Svein stinks of rat.
It's wonderful that we may borrow Kim's fabulous cat.
He loves catching rats.
-But can he do multiplication?
-No.
Then he has to leave the premises.
I'm going to teach math here.
So, take your seats, children.
Mathematics mostly deals with numbers.
The smallest number we've got is 2.
I would be surprised if something smaller would turn up.
You need math in many jobs.
For instance...math teacher.
Or author of math books.
It would be fun if some of you became math teachers.
There's a lot of math in old-style rock and roll.
Svein?
What's happening?
Getting sick of school?
-May I recite my poem now?
-Yeah, that's cool.
The language of youth.
Impulsive acts.
Go ahead with your poem.
A rat sat on a mat.
The teacher said phew.
The student was new.
That's what it was all about...
And the rat was out!
-l need to go to the toilet!
-Me too!
Halvorsen!
-Hallis...
-Halvorsen.
Oh no!
Halvorsen!
Hey!
Did you hurt my cat?
If I catch that rat on his own once, he's a dead rat!
Hello?
Hi!
I thought only Mummy and them would visit me.
You are my first friend in all of Norway.
You know what?
Mummy and Daddy told me I can have a rat.
Then you can join The Norwegian Hooded Rat Society?
NHRS.
Norwegian Hooded Rat Society?
You're out of your mind.
Bringing your rat to the hospital!
I had to.
Otherwise he has no chance of winning the contest.
I'm not that much of an expert.
But you taught your dog to walk on his hands!
Can he do anything else but eat?
Not so much.
What does he like, except rubber foam?
Fish balls and biscuits.
Halvorsen...
Up on your hind legs.
Look here.
Halvorsen...
Come on.
Cool!
Here comes dinner.
Delicious fish balls.
Oh no!
As you wish.
There's your daddy.
Check where the elevator stops.
-Poor Halvorsen.
-Poor Halvorsen?
Poor hospital!
What if he chews lots of cables?
Then he becomes a mass murderer, without even knowing.
Let's go.
NO ENTRY
Halvorsen...
How cute!
I know what they do with their lab rats.
Once I saw a picture of one with a human ear growing on its back.
They cultivate it like a potato in the field.
Let's go.
Halvorsen has just been here.
That cable looks real important.
Let's go.
Rat alarm!
Halvorsen!
There you are!
A rat alarm was sounded in Regional Hospital East.
Hundreds of rats were discovered in the basement.
So far, no human lives are lost.
Strange.
Right after we'd been there.
Halvorsen wasn't involved in this?
No...
Everyone thinks it's a disaster.
But it's only Halvorsen.
I just don't get why you brought him to the hospital.
-l went to visit Melissa.
-Melissa?
She had to help with the training.
Or else it won't work.
We have to do something to make people stop hating rats.
All you have achieved is to make people hate rats even more.
-Melissa wants you as a friend too.
-She can forget about it.
You too.
Oh no, Halvorsen.
This is a crisis!
Everyone in kindergarten says rats are dangerous.
Halvorsen is different.
Halvorsen is social, cleanly and intelligent.
Should I turn on the washing machine?
-lt's time I make myself useful.
-You're scaring me.
But I think I accept your kind offer.
Hello?
Yes, hospital director.
Excuse me?
My son's rat..?
How could you do anything as silly as this?
I just want people to stop hating rats.
I want them to understand how cool and smart they really are.
You put Halvorsen's life at risk.
The hospital was in danger.
It could have ended in disaster.
Keeping pets is a responsibility.
We've talked about this a hundred times.
You just don't seem to understand.
This is my last warning to you.
I have never seen Daddy that calm before.
If anything else happens before the contest, we're in big trouble.
Halvorsen!
Give him to me!
I'm just going to look at him.
is he as ugly inside as on the outside?
Give him back to me!
I'm just kidding around.
-Halvorsen!
-Hurry up, Tiger!
-Let go of me!
-Get him, Tiger!
Halvorsen!
If you and your ugly rat turn up at the contest, you'll regret it!
Hello.
I'm looking for a little puppy to train as a guide dog.
Have you got one?
-Of course I do.
-Wonderful!
Some first-rate puppies.
They're over here.
-Here they are.
-That's great.
These dogs are so nice.
Look at this one.
He tickles!
-What kind of breed is this?
-German shepherd dog.
-You can have him for 1 000.
-1 000?
Exactly what I've got.
Here you are.
So I can train him to stop for a red light and..?
You can train him for whatever you want.
Daddy says it's all relative.
We have to choose between school and training.
What do you think?
Look at me when I talk to you!
Melissa is avoiding us, and I can understand her.
She can't be bothered to train rats who don't...
Look at me!
People hate you, and you don't give a damn!
From now on you do as I say!
Does anyone know why Svein is not here?
-Yes?
-Probably rat disease.
I can see that you are seriously ill.
And I believed in you when you said you were ill!
I just say two words:
Wolf!
Wolf!
You don't look very ill.
Did you skip classes?
I'm trying to teach him to walk on his hands.
But it doesn't work.
Svein, cut that out!
Svein!
He won't manage with such skinny legs and such a fat butt.
-But how should I do it?
-l won't help you if you do that.
He doesn't like it.
-But he isn't good at anything!
-That's animal cruelty.
Coming from you, who forced your dog to walk on her hands?
-l did not.
-Yes, you did.
-So you lied?
-No...
I only... lt slipped out of me. I just wanted to make friends with you.
Liar!
I'll never believe anything you say!
I'll give you two words.
Or rather the same word twice.
Wolf!
Wolf!
You're only thinking about yourself and that stupid contest!
In any case, I'm not going to help you!
Mummy!
Oh my God!
-What's happening here?
-lsn't that obvious?
We have to get this junk turned off!
Help us, Svein!
This has to do with Halvorsen!
Stop blaming everyone else!
Halvorsen is not behind this!
Something's been clogging it for a long time!
This machine here... I was going to tell you.
I swear!
-You're not a good pet owner.
-We called the pet shop.
No!
You're not mature enough yet.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Tomorrow's the day for the great pet contest!
They took Halvorsen away.
Mummy and Daddy gave him back to the pet shop.
Would you like to come in?
-Maybe they didn't mean it.
-Yes, they did.
I've been pretty stupid.
Not so very stupid.
It's all over.
At least for me and Halvorsen.
-Have you talked to Melissa?
-No.
She is also mad at me. I was pretty stupid towards her, too.
Daddy?
Can just anyone buy Halvorsen now?
Don't worry about that.
Sleep well.
Svein!
I've got a great idea!
I've been thinking the whole night through.
We just have to buy him back!
That doesn't sound so smart.
Where's he supposed to live?
And that leak...
The water poured into the neighbour's apartment.
I probably have to pay for it all.
Yes, but...
We can collect bottles.
Sell the PlayStation, the TV and the stereo.
Well, maybe not the PlayStation and the TV set.
But at least we can get deposits back for bottles.
THEY TOOK HALVORSEN.
I'm really sorry it turned out this way.
But at least we can go and visit him.
Because nobody will buy a rat as old as Halvorsen.
And it's almost like visiting a grandpa at the old people's home.
I've heard that old pets that are not sold, are fed to snakes.
-Maybe we can kidnap him?
-Sounds like a good idea.
At least we can go inside and have a look?
Come on, Svein.
That would probably make Halvorsen even more sad.
I think I'd better go home.
Hello, there.
Are you going to buy anything?
I was wondering how much the rats cost.
-About 70.
-Only 70?
It's only a rat, you know.
Rats are some of the world's smartest, most adaptable animals.
Kids aren't allowed to buy pets anyway.
-Please.
-Would you..?
No.
Get out of here.
Do you know how it's going with the blind man and the guide dog you sold him?
Has he learnt to help the man onto the tram?
Stop for a red light?
That was easy!
Did you know the lady in the store?
I've met her before.
Halvorsen!
What have you done?
He was for sale, and we bought him.
He can stay with me until you're allowed to bring him home.
I'll never be allowed to.
-We think we know how.
-You have to join the contest.
-You could win with the jump.
-That would impress the judges.
-He'll be Pet of the Year.
-The newspaper comes...
Home to you.
Like with Kim last year.
It's ridiculous if the Pet of the Year doesn't live with his owner.
Even your mother would understand that.
We will now present the award for Dog of the Year.
Congratulations, Bulldog.
Congratulations, rabbit Kalle.
And last but not least, the Asian Leopard Cat, Tiger, and his owner Kim.
Kim and Tiger are big favourites in the category Pet of the Year.
Time to move on.
Unfortunately, we are obliged to continue with Rat of the Year.
There are only two participants, which is maybe not so strange.
We have Johnny and his Bjarne.
And Svein and Halvorsen.
I guess Svein is the one with the big ears.
The first discipline is tightrope walking.
And the first participant is Bjarne with his Johnny.
So I just say:
Action!
Make me proud now.
A rat knows how to balance?
What do you know!
And the judges say..?
Three times 9.
Fantastic.
Time for the next participants.
Svein and Halvorsen.
Are you ready?
Go ahead.
Go on.
Don't embarass us too much.
Who would believe that a rat could do that?
I'm impressed.
Once again 9.
Fantastic!
We're ready for the next discipline.
Rat race.
Please bring in the racing track as quickly as possible.
In the rat race, the first rat to reach the finish line is the winner.
-Are you ready?
-Yes.
Svein and Halvorsen, ready?
On your marks.
Okay.
Here we go. lt's Halvorsen...
Bjarne...
Halvorsen...
Halvorsen, Bjarne...
Here he comes again!
Halvorsen fights, but Bjarne comes on strong!
It's so even!
Halvorsen is in the lead, but here comes Bjarne...
Bjarne is first, but...
What's happening?
Halvorsen stops completely!
Victory to Bjarne!
The last discipline is hoop-jumping.
Girls, please bring in the table as fast as lightning.
Hoop-jumping.
Johnny and Bjarne first.
-Are you ready?
-Yes.
Come on.
How unfortunate.
He did not manage.
Then we're ready for Svein and Halvorsen.
If Halvorsen manages to jump through the hoop, he has won the competition.
Are you ready?
Go ahead!
Come on, Halvorsen.
This is it.
Jump!
Come on, Halvorsen.
Please jump.
Jump...
Come on!
Jump, Halvorsen.
Do it.
Jump.
is there anything wrong?
What do you mean?
You don't want to do this anymore?
You probably think I'm a jerk, the way I've behaved.
I promise I'll never again do anything you don't like.
Are we friends again?
You scoundrel!
You're tickling me!
You little rascal!
-Would you like to try again?
-No.
These contests aren't really Halvorsen's style.
We're done.
Then we have no other choice but to name Johnny and his Bjarne winners of the rat category.
Congratulations.
Johnny and Bjarne!
Give them a big hand!
Halvorsen lives with Dan.
We thought that maybe... lf it's OK with Halvorsen, he could live with us from time to time.
All right. lt's time to present tonight's Grand Prize.
Pet of the Year!
And the winner... ls...
Svein and his rat Halvorsen!
A wonderful representative.
Here is his cup.
He gets the award because he has shown us how beautiful interaction between man and pet can be.
-Do you think I can join the NHRS?
-Of course.
You'll be member number 3.
The Norwegian Hooded Rat Society!
NHRS!
I guess not everybody likes rats.
That's OK.
People may like whatever pet they want.
Halvorsen and I like each other a whole lot.
And that's what really matters.
In Bed-Stuy, a lot of people have reputations for different things.
Diedre Garfield was 23 and had a reputation for being the youngest grandmother in Brooklyn.
All right, I got everything under control!
Mr. Jackson had a reputation for being crazy as hell.
And a lot of people say he invented homelessness.
Move the car!
You want to fight?
I had a reputation, too... not only for being a nerd or getting beat up every day,
I was also known for being the best Asteroids player in Bed-Stuy.
I'll beat people from all over:
Chinatown...
Rikers...
the Village...
Even though I was a nerd, it felt really good that there was one thing that nobody could beat me at.
Chris, somebody beat your score last night.
Hey, even Mike Tyson got knocked out.
Ain't this about... 1x15 Everybody Hates the Lottery
Transcript:
Raceman Synchro:
Sixe
My mother had paying bills down to a science, but there were always things she didn't count on.
Aah, damm it!
Hey, honey.
Hey, baby.
What's wrong?
Well, I used this month's phone bill to pay half of last mont's electric bill, and now I don't have enough for the gas bill.
Well, why don't you just use the electric bill money to pay the electric bill?
Well, Tonya had to get a filling.
She had a cavity.
She did?
My father never knew when there was anything wrong with the kids unless we were unconscious or in the hospital.
Oh...
Oh, no, no, no.
We're gonna have to cut back.
Cut back on what?
I mean, we're barely getting by as it is.
That look only meant one thing.
Oh, no.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh, not my turtles.
You are not taking away my turtles.
My mother love chocolate turtles more than anything else in the world.
Whenever she ate one, it was like all of life's problems just went away.
It's a good thing she chose those turtles instead of guns.
Those chocolate turtles are costing us $12 a box.
You gotta take away my turtles.
You know I need my turtles.
Why don't you cut off your lottery playing?
I ain't cutting off my number.
Oh!
If you don't play, how can you expect to win?
Look, it says so right here.
Oh, no, no, no.
No that damned dream book.
My dad was the most level-headed person I knew, except when it came to playing the lottery, and he always consulted his lucky star dream book.
A dream book takes any possible dream you can have and transforms it into a lucky number.
You dreamt about a monkey on the train in the middle of a blizzard.
Here it is-- eight-one-four!
I dreamt Dr. J was roller-skating with two white women in Sweden.
Here it is-- sx-two-one.
White ladies?
Rochelle, if I win the lottery, you can buy all the chocolate turtles you want.
But you eating chocolate turtles ain't helping nobody.
Well, if you're playing the lottery,
I'm eating my turtles.
All right...
I'll quit the lottery.
Okay, then.
Can you believe this is a real argument
At school, even Greg was getting a reputation.
And for "Best Attendance"...
Gregory Wuliger!
Yes!
Getting an award for attendance is kind of like getting an award for breathing.
Wait, your dad is giving you $5 just for coming to school?
I bet him I wouldn't miss a day of school this year.
So far so good.
My mother told me I'd better not miss a day of school or else she'd take $5 off my ass.
This is so cool.
The only award I could've gotten at Corleone would've been...
For "Taking the Best Ass Whooping"...
Chris.
But instead of an award,
I had Asteroids.
Hey, I got the top five scores on Asteroids yesterday.
Get out of here.
No way.
Yeah, but some kid beat me.
I gotta protect my title.
Man, you're just like Apollo Creed in Rocky II.
You sure you can beat this guy?
Eh, I've got a reputation to maintain.
Hey, Tonya, ask Daddy for some money so we can get some candy tomorrow.
How come you can't ask?
Because if I ask, he'll give me a speech.
If you ask, he'll give you the money.
If Daddy gives me the money, you have to share some of that candy.
O kay.
Six...
Daddy.
Huh?
What?
Can I have a dollar?
What do you need a dollar for?
I want to get Drew some, um... some candy.
Oh... that's nice.
My father was crazy about Tonya.
She was the only one in the house who would dare take sleep and money from him at the same time.
Thanks, Daddy.
In Bed-Stuy, we never had a real video arcade to go to.
All we had was Doc's.
At Doc's, you can get almost anything.
You could cash a check.
That would be $5.
You could get an alibi.
Nah, it wasn't him.
He was here.
That'll be $5.
You could even get your teeth pulled.
Open.
Your mama know you're down here?
Yes, sir.
My mother didn't like me hanging out at Doc's 'cause she thought that would eventually lead to this.
I'm a junkie.
A crackhead.
Look, just tell my ma her oldest son is a crackhead.
Hey!
Little dude from across the street.
Usually Jerome would rob me, but not when I was about to play Asertoids.
You getting ready to play Asteroids?
Yes.
Some guy beat my score.
For real?
Oh, no!
I know you're not gonna take that, man.
You'd better protect your rep.
If I didn't get my high score back, somebody was gonna get hit with a brick.
You're Chris.
Hey, he's big.
So you're Doah.
Doah.
That's DOA.
It means "Dead On Arrival."
My name is Jorge.
So what, you want to play?
Come on.
I know it looks strange, but before peple got play stations in their backseats, you actually have to go someplace to play video games.
All right, man, that was a good game.
Hey, where are you going?
I gotta get home.
What, you're not gonna give him a rematch?
Yeah, you can' t just beat the man and walk out.
Hey, I really gotta go.
Besides, I'll just beat him again.
Want to put some money on that?
If you have a good reputation, you have to be willing to do anything to protect it.
I can't play for money.
Don't tell me you're scared.
I'm not.
I just gotta go home.
Hey, I can't believe you.
You're scared of this dude.
Come on, yo, get home, come on.
Anybody got five bucks?
Hey!
I need a favor.
I need to borrow your five dollars.
What?
What do you need it for?
I beat this kid playing Asteroids, and now he wants to play for money.
Can't you just save up your lunch money?
Or take your neighbor's garbage out?
Or help small ladies carry groceries to their car.
Or turn in some Coke bottles or something.
Note yourself when begging, be persistent.
Hey, I don't have time for this.
You got to do this, or my reputation's gonna be ruined.
I wonder if that's how O.J. got A.C. to drive that Bronco.
Thanks.
After a day with no turtles, my mother was going through serious sugar withdrawal.
She'd eat any sugar she could find.
From anywhere she could find it.
All I can tell you is that crack ain't got nothin' on chocolate turtles.
Here.
Drew was getting his fix, too.
I know you're giving me more than that.
You're not supposed to be eating candy, anyway.
You just got a filling.
I'm telling Mama!
Some people had rum, my mom had Aunt Jemima.
Mama, see?
Drew got some candy, and this is all he gave me- three piec...
Ma!
- Candy?
Did you say candy?
- Yeah?
- Drew, get in here!
You got candy?
- Ma!
- Don't "Ma" me.
Don't "Ma" me right now, boy.
Do you have anything in here that...
- ...that tastes like turtles?
- No.
Something that has chocolate, peanuts, caramel,
- something like that?
- I don't know.
Well, where in the world did you get money for candy?
Daddy.
Oh...!
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
What he's actually talking about is which one of us he's gonna rob after we get through with the game.
- Ha!
- Oh, whoa!
- Wh-Wh-What's wrong with you!
- Turtles!
I ain't got my turtles!
I'm over here drinking syrup while you're still buying lottery tickets.
What's wrong with me!
What's wrong with you?
!
Baby, I did it for you.
Julius, we both had an agreement.
And you have to honor that agreement.
Do you know what kind of message we are sending to our children?
!
- Message?
- You're telling our kids,
"Oh, go ahead, little children, ignore your mother, 'cause she's a lunatic"!
- I didn't say that!
- Yes, you did!
What I meant was, it's just... it's... it's just a couple of dollars.
Are we cutting back?
Or am I...
cutting back.
'Cause I can't do it by myself.
Ah, baby, no, baby.
I feel alone...
No, no, we-we're cutting back, we're cutting back, okay?
I'm sorry.
We can do this!
We can do this.
I get the shakes at night,
Julius, I get the shakes!
It's all right, we can do this.
Okay.
Okay.
Fine.
Yeah, baby!
Oh, yeah, baby!
Watch out, let me through.
Good game.
You almost had him.
You got a lot of heart, little dude.
I wonder if I could sell my heart for five dollars.
You lost?
How can you lose?
Hey, I'll pay you back--
I'll... carry some groceries or return some soda bottles or something.
That crap'll take forever!
Well, why'd you tell me to do it?
Because I didn't want to give you my money?
I'm as surprised as you are.
No.
I'd say you're about five bucks less surprised than I am.
He's starting to sound like my father.
Hey.
I'm gonna pay you back.
It'll take a couple of weeks, but I will.
You got to play him again.
No.
I don't think so.
What about your rep?
I've got a new one:
sucker.
Come on.
I missed being the Asteroids champ of Bed-Stuy.
Without that,
I was just another bum from the neighborhood.
My father wouldn't usually admit he was wrong about things, at least not in front of the kids.
I have something to say.
I thought he was about to tell us he was leaving us for a white family across town.
I'm sorry.
What'd you do?
After your mother gave up her chocolate turtles so we could pay the bills...
I played the lottery.
I shouldn't have done that.
I was wrong.
Is that why she ate up all our candy?
I should've never given you money for candy.
Dad, um, it's not all her fault.
I asked her to do it.
But only because I knew you'd give it to her.
How'd you know that?
Because you give her everything she wants.
That's not true.
One time I asked if I could set Chris on fire, and he didn't let me do that.
Well, thank goodness for that.
I have a confession, too.
I've been hanging out at that corner store.
- Chris...
- But I was only playing Asteroids.
Oh.
Well, that ain't so bad.
And I lost five dollars.
What?
!
Five dollars?
Ooh...
I'm telling!
Now, who are you gonna tell?
We're all sitting right here.
How did you lose five dollars, boy?
Where did you get five dollars?
I bet a guy playing Asteroids, and... and I got the five dollars from Greg.
What are you doing betting on video games?
I was trying to protect my reputation.
You have a reputation?
Yeah.
I am the best player on the block.
Then how come you didn't win?
Because you need to be quiet, that's why!
Don't tell me to be...
Hey, hey, that's enough.
It's your problem.
You borrowed it, you pay it back.
I am.
Well, I know I better not hear no more about you betting money,
- you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.
All right.
Mama, can we have our candy...
No!
I ate it.
I don't need y'all getting any more cavities than what y'all got.
No cavities in this house.
But at this rate, there'll be plenty of diabetes.
Needs some more sugar.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
I had this weird dream last night and couldn't fall back to sleep.
Dream, huh?
Yeah, it was bizarre.
I was walking down the street, waving hello to everybody, but nobody was waving back.
It was as if they couldn't see me.
So you were invisible?
Yeah.
Mama had turtles, Daddy had the lottery.
Oh, that's right...
It's a wonder nobody sold the TV.
I need you to go to the corner store after school and buy a lottery ticket for me.
Six-three-seven.
- Yeah, but you said you weren't...
- I know what I said!
Huh?
I've just got a feeling about this.
Translation:
Just shut up and do what I tell you.
Now, keep this between me and you, all right?
Six-three-seven, all right?
And keep the ticket on you.
Go!
Go, go, go!
He hadn't been that excited about a dream since Martin Luther King's.
What do you need today?
My father played the lottery a thousand times and lost a thousand times.
I had only lost my rep once, and I wasn't about to let that happen again.
Give me four quarters.
Now you're talking.
Want to play me for some more money?
I don't have any money.
I just want to prove I can beat you.
No...
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
One-zero, sucka!
ha!
Good game, man.
You should've bet me, though.
If I had bet him,
I couldn't help but think that this would've happened.
Ah, I'm hungry.
Looks, good, huh?
Who are you?
I'm Jorge.
I won your family from Chris playing Asteroids.
I told Chris to stay out of that store.
- Can you cook mofongo?
- What?
- What'd you call her?
- Come tu comida.
I was raised around Puerto Ricans?
There's something about defending your reputation that makes you feel like you really accomplished something.
And even though I didn't get Greg's money back,
I had my rep.
Even though my father never won the lottery, it always made him feel like there was one thing in the world he had a shot at winning.
And to him, that dollar was worth it.
And tonight's winning numbers are...
S ix... three... seven.
I won!
I won!
I won!
- What happened?
- My number hit!
Chris, show your mama the ticket.
Show your mama the ticket, man!
Show your mama the ticket.
Mama!

Now, who are you gonna tell?
We're all sitting right here.
How did you lose five dollars, boy?
Where did you get five dollars?
I bet a guy playing Asteroids, and... and I got the five dollars from Greg.
What are you doing betting on video games?
I was trying to protect my reputation.
You have a reputation?
Yeah.
I am the best player on the block.
Then how come you didn't win?
Because you need to be quiet, that's why!
Don't tell me to be...
Hey, hey, that's enough.
It's your problem.
You borrowed it, you pay it back.
I am.
Well, I know I better not hear no more about you betting money,
- you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.
All right.
Mama, can we have our candy...
No!
I ate it.
I don't need y'all getting any more cavities than what y'all got.
No cavities in this house.
But at this rate, there'll be plenty of diabetes.
Needs some more sugar.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
I had this weird dream last night and couldn't fall back to sleep.
Dream, huh?
Yeah, it was bizarre.
I was walking down the street, waving hello to everybody, but nobody was waving back.
It was as if they couldn't see me.
So you were invisible?
Yeah.
Mama had turtles, Daddy had the lottery.
Oh, that's right...
It's a wonder nobody sold the TV.
I need you to go to the corner store after school and buy a lottery ticket for me.
Six-three-seven.
- Yeah, but you said you weren't...
- I know what I said!
Huh?
I've just got a feeling about this.
Translation:
Just shut up and do what I tell you.
Now, keep this between me and you, all right?
Six-three-seven, all right?
And keep the ticket on you.
Go!
Go, go, go!
He hadn't been that excited about a dream since Martin Luther King's.
What do you need today?
My father played the lottery a thousand times and lost a thousand times.
I had only lost my rep once, and I wasn't about to let that happen again.
Give me four quarters.
Now you're talking.
Want to play me for some more money?
I don't have any money.
I just want to prove I can beat you.
No...
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
One-zero, sucka!
ha!
Good game, man.
You should've bet me, though.
If I had bet him,
I couldn't help but think that this would've happened.
Ah, I'm hungry.
Looks, good, huh?
Who are you?
I'm Jorge.
I won your family from Chris playing Asteroids.
I told Chris to stay out of that store.
- Can you cook mofongo?
- What?
- What'd you call her?
- Come tu comida.
I was raised around Puerto Ricans?
There's something about defending your reputation that makes you feel like you really accomplished something.
And even though I didn't get Greg's money back,
I had my rep.
Even though my father never won the lottery, it always made him feel like there was one thing in the world he had a shot at winning.
And to him, that dollar was worth it.
And tonight's winning numbers are...
Six... three... seven.
I won!
I won!
I won!
- What happened?
- My number hit!
Chris, show your mama the ticket.
Show your mama the ticket, man!
Show your mama the ticket.
Mama!
In Bed-Stuy, a lot of people have reputations for different things.
Diedre Garfield was 23 and had a reputation for being the youngest grandmother in Brooklyn.
All right, I got everything under control!
Mr. Jackson had a reputation for being crazy as hell.
And a lot of people say he invented homelessness.
Move the car!
You want to fight?
I had a reputation, too... not only for being a nerd or getting beat up every day,
I was also known for being the best Asteroids player in Bed-Stuy.
I'll beat people from all over:
Chinatown...
Rikers...
the Village...
Even though I was a nerd, it felt really good that there was one thing that nobody could beat me at.
Chris, somebody beat your score last night.
Hey, even Mike Tyson got knocked out.
Ain't this about... 1x15 Everybody Hates the Lottery

Raceman Synchro:
Sixe
My mother had paying bills down to a science, but there were always things she didn't count on.
Aah, damm it!
Hey, honey.
Hey, baby.
What's wrong?
Well, I used this month's phone bill to pay half of last mont's electric bill, and now I don't have enough for the gas bill.
Well, why don't you just use the electric bill money to pay the electric bill?
Well, Tonya had to get a filling.
She had a cavity.
She did?
My father never knew when there was anything wrong with the kids unless we were unconscious or in the hospital.
Oh...
Oh, no, no, no.
We're gonna have to cut back.
Cut back on what?
I mean, we're barely getting by as it is.
That look only meant one thing.
Oh, no.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh, not my turtles.
You are not taking away my turtles.
My mother love chocolate turtles more than anything else in the world.
Whenever she ate one, it was like all of life's problems just went away.
It's a good thing she chose those turtles instead of guns.
Those chocolate turtles are costing us $12 a box.
You gotta take away my turtles.
You know I need my turtles.
Why don't you cut off your lottery playing?
I ain't cutting off my number.
Oh!
If you don't play, how can you expect to win?
Look, it says so right here.
Oh, no, no, no.
No that damned dream book.
My dad was the most level-headed person I knew, except when it came to playing the lottery, and he always consulted his lucky star dream book.
A dream book takes any possible dream you can have and transforms it into a lucky number.
You dreamt about a monkey on the train in the middle of a blizzard.
Here it is-- eight-one-four!
I dreamt Dr. J was roller-skating with two white women in Sweden.
Here it is-- sx-two-one.
White ladies?
Rochelle, if I win the lottery, you can buy all the chocolate turtles you want.
But you eating chocolate turtles ain't helping nobody.
Well, if you're playing the lottery,
I'm eating my turtles.
All right...
I'll quit the lottery.
Okay, then.
Can you believe this is a real argument
At school, even Greg was getting a reputation.
And for "Best Attendance"...
Gregory Wuliger!
Yes!
Getting an award for attendance is kind of like getting an award for breathing.
Wait, your dad is giving you $5 just for coming to school?
I bet him I wouldn't miss a day of school this year.
So far so good.
My mother told me I'd better not miss a day of school or else she'd take $5 off my ass.
This is so cool.
The only award I could've gotten at Corleone would've been...
For "Taking the Best Ass Whooping"...
Chris.
But instead of an award,
I had Asteroids.
Hey, I got the top five scores on Asteroids yesterday.
Get out of here.
No way.
Yeah, but some kid beat me.
I gotta protect my title.
Man, you're just like Apollo Creed in Rocky II.
You sure you can beat this guy?
Eh, I've got a reputation to maintain.
Hey, Tonya, ask Daddy for some money so we can get some candy tomorrow.
How come you can't ask?
Because if I ask, he'll give me a speech.
If you ask, he'll give you the money.
If Daddy gives me the money, you have to share some of that candy.
Okay.
Six...
Daddy.
Huh?
What?
Can I have a dollar?
What do you need a dollar for?
I want to get Drew some, um... some candy.
Oh... that's nice.
My father was crazy about Tonya.
She was the only one in the house who would dare take sleep and money from him at the same time.
Thanks, Daddy.
In Bed-Stuy, we never had a real video arcade to go to.
All we had was Doc's.
At Doc's, you can get almost anything.
You could cash a check.
That would be $5.
You could get an alibi.
Nah, it wasn't him.
He was here.
That'll be $5.
You could even get your teeth pulled.
Open.
Your mama know you're down here?
Yes, sir.
My mother didn't like me hanging out at Doc's 'cause she thought that would eventually lead to this.
I'm a junkie.
A crackhead.
Look, just tell my ma her oldest son is a crackhead.
Hey!
Little dude from across the street.
Usually Jerome would rob me, but not when I was about to play Asertoids.
You getting ready to play Asteroids?
Yes.
Some guy beat my score.
For real?
Oh, no!
I know you're not gonna take that, man.
You'd better protect your rep.
If I didn't get my high score back, somebody was gonna get hit with a brick.
You're Chris.
Hey, he's big.
So you're Doah.
Doah.
That's DOA.
It means "Dead On Arrival."
My name is Jorge.
So what, you want to play?
Come on.
I know it looks strange, but before peple got play stations in their backseats, you actually have to go someplace to play video games.
All right, man, that was a good game.
Hey, where are you going?
I gotta get home.
What, you're not gonna give him a rematch?
Yeah, you can' t just beat the man and walk out.
Hey, I really gotta go.
Besides, I'll just beat him again.
Want to put some money on that?
If you have a good reputation, you have to be willing to do anything to protect it.
I can't play for money.
Don't tell me you're scared.
I'm not.
I just gotta go home.
Hey, I can't believe you.
You're scared of this dude.
Come on, yo, get home, come on.
Anybody got five bucks?
Hey!
I need a favor.
I need to borrow your five dollars.
What?
What do you need it for?
I beat this kid playing Asteroids, and now he wants to play for money.
Can't you just save up your lunch money?
Or take your neighbor's garbage out?
Or help small ladies carry groceries to their car.
Or turn in some Coke bottles or something.
Note yourself when begging, be persistent.
Hey, I don't have time for this.
You got to do this, or my reputation's gonna be ruined.
I wonder if that's how O.J. got A.C. to drive that Bronco.
Thanks.
After a day with no turtles, my mother was going through serious sugar withdrawal.
She'd eat any sugar she could find.
From anywhere she could find it.
All I can tell you is that crack ain't got nothin' on chocolate turtles.
H ere.
Drew was getting his fix, too.
I know you're giving me more than that.
You're not supposed to be eating candy, anyway.
You just got a filling.
I'm telling Mama!
Some people had rum, my mom had Aunt Jemima.
Mama, see?
Drew got some candy, and this is all he gave me- three piec...
Ma!
- Candy?
Did you say candy?
- Yeah?
- Drew, get in here!
You got candy?
- Ma!
- Don't "Ma" me.
Don't "Ma" me right now, boy.
Do you have anything in here that...
- ...that tastes like turtles?
- No.
Something that has chocolate, peanuts, caramel,
- something like that?
- I don't know.
Well, where in the world did you get money for candy?
Daddy.
Oh...!
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
What he's actually talking about is which one of us he's gonna rob after we get through with the game.
- Ha!
- Oh, whoa!
- Wh-Wh-What's wrong with you!
- Turtles!
I ain't got my turtles!
I'm over here drinking syrup while you're still buying lottery tickets.
What's wrong with me!
What's wrong with you?
!
Baby, I did it for you.
Julius, we both had an agreement.
And you have to honor that agreement.
Do you know what kind of message we are sending to our children?
!
- Message?
- You're telling our kids,
"Oh, go ahead, little children, ignore your mother, 'cause she's a lunatic"!
- I didn't say that!
- Yes, you did!
What I meant was, it's just... it's... it's just a couple of dollars.
Are we cutting back?
Or am I...
cutting back.
'Cause I can't do it by myself.
Ah, baby, no, baby.
I feel alone...
No, no, we-we're cutting back, we're cutting back, okay?
I'm sorry.
We can do this!
We can do this.
I get the shakes at night,
Julius, I get the shakes!
It's all right, we can do this.
Okay.
Okay.
Fine.
Yeah, baby!
Oh, yeah, baby!
Watch out, let me through.
Good game.
You almost had him.
You got a lot of heart, little dude.
I wonder if I could sell my heart for five dollars.
You lost?
How can you lose?
Hey, I'll pay you back--
I'll... carry some groceries or return some soda bottles or something.
That crap'll take forever!
Well, why'd you tell me to do it?
Because I didn't want to give you my money?
I'm as surprised as you are.
No.
I'd say you're about five bucks less surprised than I am.
He's starting to sound like my father.
Hey.
I'm gonna pay you back.
It'll take a couple of weeks, but I will.
You got to play him again.
No.
I don't think so.
What about your rep?
I've got a new one:
sucker.
Come on.
I missed being the Asteroids champ of Bed-Stuy.
Without that,
I was just another bum from the neighborhood.
My father wouldn't usually admit he was wrong about things, at least not in front of the kids.
I have something to say.
I thought he was about to tell us he was leaving us for a white family across town.
I'm sorry.
What'd you do?
After your mother gave up her chocolate turtles so we could pay the bills...
I played the lottery.
I shouldn't have done that.
I was wrong.
Is that why she ate up all our candy?
I should've never given you money for candy.
Dad, um, it's not all her fault.
I asked her to do it.
But only because I knew you'd give it to her.
How'd you know that?
Because you give her everything she wants.
That's not true.
One time I asked if I could set Chris on fire, and he didn't let me do that.
Well, thank goodness for that.
I have a confession, too.
I've been hanging out at that corner store.
- Chris...
- But I was only playing Asteroids.
Oh.
Well, that ain't so bad.
And I lost five dollars.
What?
!
Five dollars?
Ooh...
I'm telling!
Now, who are you gonna tell?
We're all sitting right here.
How did you lose five dollars, boy?
Where did you get five dollars?
I bet a guy playing Asteroids, and... and I got the five dollars from Greg.
What are you doing betting on video games?
I was trying to protect my reputation.
You have a reputation?
Yeah.
I am the best player on the block.
Then how come you didn't win?
Because you need to be quiet, that's why!
Don't tell me to be...
Hey, hey, that's enough.
It's your problem.
You borrowed it, you pay it back.
I am.
Well, I know I better not hear no more about you betting money,
- you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.
All right.
Mama, can we have our candy...
No!
I ate it.
I don't need y'all getting any more cavities than what y'all got.
No cavities in this house.
But at this rate, there'll be plenty of diabetes.
Needs some more sugar.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
I had this weird dream last night and couldn't fall back to sleep.
Dream, huh?
Yeah, it was bizarre.
I was walking down the street, waving hello to everybody, but nobody was waving back.
It was as if they couldn't see me.
So you were invisible?
Yeah.
Mama had turtles, Daddy had the lottery.
Oh, that's right...
It's a wonder nobody sold the TV.
I need you to go to the corner store after school and buy a lottery ticket for me.
Six-three-seven.
- Yeah, but you said you weren't...
- I know what I said!
Huh?
I've just got a feeling about this.
Translation:
Just shut up and do what I tell you.
Now, keep this between me and you, all right?
Six-three-seven, all right?
And keep the ticket on you.
Go!
Go, go, go!
He hadn't been that excited about a dream since Martin Luther King's.
What do you need today?
My father played the lottery a thousand times and lost a thousand times.
I had only lost my rep once, and I wasn't about to let that happen again.
Give me four quarters.
Now you're talking.
Want to play me for some more money?
I don't have any money.
I just want to prove I can beat you.
No...
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
One-zero, sucka!
ha!
Good game, man.
You should've bet me, though.
If I had bet him,
I couldn't help but think that this would've happened.
Ah, I'm hungry.
Looks, good, huh?
Who are you?
I'm Jorge.
I won your family from Chris playing Asteroids.

Previously, on The O.C.--
Do you think that Marissa would mind if I invited Johnny?
She seemed a little weird when she saw us together last night.
But they're just friends, so why would it matter?
I love Ryan.
It doesn't mean that you don't like Johnny.
I don't.
Then you wouldn't mind that I just made out with him upstairs.
We both have very complex lives, and... maybe we should consider all of the implications before going further.
Are we building a hospital?
Is it too late for a new approach?
Let's do it your way.
You're trying to take care of me.
The least I can do is take care of you.
Caleb would've been proud.
We got it.
Sandy, that's wonderful.
And you did it your way.
Yeah.
Cohen!
I got one!
Got an interview with the Brown guy.
Mrs. Rothschild just told me, and that you got one, too.
Please tell me it went okay.
It went great.
We totally bonded.
Are you high?
Am I high?
Ryan.
Ryan.
Come on, wake up.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Seth is gone.
What?
He's gone?
Yeah.
His alarm went off, I went into his room, his bed his empty.
Uh... calc exam.
Calc exam?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, he probably just went in early to school to cram for it.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna drive over there to make sure.
No, no.
I'll go.
I'll go.
I got to get to school early anyway.
If there was anything going on with, Seth, anything I should know, you would tell me, right?
Yeah.
I'll call you, uh, when I find him.
Hey, man.
So, uh, Sandy noticed you're gone-- he's worried.
Just taking in the sunrise, Ryan.
Yeah, that's what they have windows for.
So I wanted to be alone-- are you the only one in this family that's allowed to brood?
Man, whatever it is, you can tell me.
My Brown interview did not go... so well.
Actually, it didn't go at all.
You blew it off?
Yep.
And then to put the cherry on top of that, I went ahead and lied to Summer about it.
Right.
Well...
I don't know, talk to her.
Yeah, see, Summer was over pot by the tenth grade.
She thinks it's totally juvenile-- it'd be like telling her I'm into Beanie Babies.
Well, you know, at least tell her that you missed the interview.
You do that, and I'll keep quiet about the rest of it.
We're getting dangerously close to an after-school special here, Ryan.
It's marijuana, and I did it twice.
So you're telling me you didn't come down here to buy a bag?
Fine, I wasn't gonna smoke anymore anyways.
What are you doing?
Trying to decide on a bathing suit.
Do you think tankinis are over?
You're going swimming?
No.
Johnny's taking me for a surf lesson.
He says the waves are always best in the morning.
That's what I hear.
Look...
I know that you're mad about me and Johnny.
I'm not mad.
Do I look mad?
Okay, we may not be BFFs, but you're my sister, and I can tell when you're mad.
Kaitlin, look in my eyes.
I don't care about you and Johnny.
You have a boyfriend.
So Johnny Harbor's fair game, right?
I'm not talking about this.
Can you honestly tell me you have no feelings for him?
That's what I thought.
Hey.
You're right on time.
Sorry, I didn't mean to walk in on anything.
No problem.
You ready to surf?
Uh, I got to go.
Enjoy the beach.
Katy Rubell, 39, single.
Loves tennis, loves working out.
Do we have anyone for her?
I say she dies alone.
Julie!
I'm sorry, I just can't focus on fixing other people's love lives when my own is such a mess.
Dr. Roberts will call you.
Or if you want, you could call him.
I know you've been married for, like, 200 years, but you must remember something about dating.
Well, I hope so, or I'm in the wrong business.
Maybe that's the answer.
Pitch Dr. Roberts the dating service, set him up.
Set him up?
Are you high?
No, I'm serious.
Then you'll be back on his radar and it won't seem like you're pursuing him.
I like it.
I'm aloof but thoughtful.
And when he's confronted with the idea of dating these Newpsies...
Half of whom he's Botox'd himself.
...he will realize that the only woman he wants is you.
And he will call you for dinner.
I'll suggest Al Fiorno's, a table by the window.
I'm impressed.
You're sneakier than I thought, Kirsten Cohen.
Well, being around you all these years, it's rubbed off.
Hey.
Hey, Cohen.
Hey, did you write your thank you note yet to the Brown interviewer?
No.
Actually, that's something I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, you came to the right person, because I am master of the thank you note.
Listen to this.
"Thank you so much for the resplendent interview."
"Resplendent."
Yeah.
I bought a thesaurus.
Shelly loves SAT words.
Hey, I didn't know you two were on a first-name basis.
Oh, yeah, we totally power-bonded.
Which means I may actually have a chance of getting into Brown.
Do you know what that means?
No calling, no texting, no e-mailing-- just us together, isn't that great?
Y eah.
Okay, so tell me-- how did your interview really go?
Do you think you aced it?
I knocked it out of the park.
- Really?
!
- Yeah.
Yeah.
And it wasn't easy, believe me, but, you know, I turned on the Cohen charm, as usual, and... the lady swooned.
- Cohen?
- Yeah?
Shelly's a guy.
Is it because... yes, yes, you're...
I'm sor... correct.
But with the feminine energy, I don't know, I got a gay vibe,
I'm gender-blind, that's the thing, and that's something that I'm gonna have to work on at Brown next year when we go together, when we go together.
Okay, I'm gonna see you later.
I got to go.
- Cohen.
- We'll talk after school.
Wow, somebody was really craving caffeine.
Oh, yeah.
I can barely keep my eyes open.
Early morning wake-up call, courtesy of Seth.
Oh, has he told Summer yet?
No, and he's not going to.
By the way, I promised that, um, we'd keep quiet about it, as long as he told her about the interview.
Oh, I was looking forward to Summer bitch-slapping Kaitlin for giving Seth pot.
Guess she's just gonna get away with it, like always.
You know, it's for the best.
I mean, she screwed up, but she's still pretty much a kid.
Yeah.
But with my mom's DNA.
Which means she's capable of more than you think.
Um... are we still talking about Seth, or...
This is just sister stuff.
You know, I should probably get to class.
See you later.
Okay.
It's "just sister stuff"?
Okay, let's practice your pop-up one more time.
When you told me you were gonna give me a surfing lesson,
I kind of imagined us in the water.
No, no.
First lesson's always on the sand.
As long as we're skipping the water part, why don't we just do this back at your place?
Or we could just blow the whole thing off.
Rent a movie, order in pancakes.
I thought you said you wanted to learn how to surf.
I'm not training for the Olympics, okay?
Sorry.
I'm just distracted.
Thinking about Marissa.
Story of my life.
I like a guy, he's in love with my older sister...
Look, Marissa and I have a history together, all right?
It's... just complicated.
Uncomplicate it.
Do something.
I can't do anything.
It's not my place.
If you're too lame to do something, I'll just find somebody who will.
I thought this was a done deal.
Miriam already gave us the hospital contract.
He did.
And now he has to present it to the Board of Physicians.
Can't have a hospital without doctors.
Like or not, they got a say.
Right.
Now we have to ply more people with women and liquor.
I don't think that's gonna work.
These guys are doctors, not businessmen.
Then we got that in common.
Call it willful naiveté, call it bleary-eyed optimism.
You think we've got a shot.
Yeah.
There's over 100,000 uninsured that live in Orange County.
There's got to be some angle we can find to make that land on these guys.
Well, there is.
The head of the board, Henry Griffin.
Turns out we have a... a personal connection.
Well, now, there's a shocking turn of events.
It's his daughter, Maya.
She's a stripper, too?
No, she was a year ahead of me at Kellogg.
Now she's one of its most trusted advisors.
And she used to have a thing for me.
Well, who could blame her?
So now you want to wine and dine her, use her affection for you to manipulate her father.
Listen, it's no worse than the strippers we got for Bill Miriam.
Oh, I don't know.
I draw the line at family, Matt.
How about this?
How about we find a strategy that doesn't involve liquor or sexual favors?
Thank you.
I mean, gracias.
Julie?
Hi.
Uh, your receptionist told me you'd be home today, so I thought I'd come by and personally thank you for hosting Kaitlin's birthday party.
And as a token of my appreciation...
Bachelorettes of Newport?
You want to set me up?
Well, unless... you don't want to be set up.
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.
Because I can totally understand if a blind date seems like too much.
Let's see what you have there.
New match.
Wow, she's pretty.
Mmm, pear shaped.
But pretty.
Ooh.
Look at her, nice... smile.
Yeah.
Adult braces.
And her...
Julie, all of these women look fantastic.
It's going to take me a while to choose one.
Do you mind if I get back to you?
Finally, you're home.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were waiting for me.
Well, I just get kind of lonely while you guys are all at school.
Speaking of school, shouldn't you be going back to yours soon?
How many times do I have to tell you guys?
It's called mid-winter break.
It's long.
Apparently.
Look, I want to talk to you about Marissa.
This whole Johnny triangle we're all trapped in.
Triangle?
Well, now that I'm here, it's more like a square.
Well, anyway, see, I like him.
And I'm not getting anywhere because he thinks he's got a chance with Marissa.
Well, not that that's any of your business, but it's not the case.
I don't know.
See, today I asked her if she had feelings for him point blank.
She didn't deny it.
Well, thanks for the heads up.
I think Marissa and I can handle it ourselves.
So if you just want to...
Ryan, I want you to do something about it.
I mean, you're a man of action.
You throw punches at fires.
At least that's the guy I remember from two years ago.
We've all grown up since then.
So you're reformed now?
Congratulations.
Doesn't mean you still can't talk to her.
So you can hook up with Johnny?
You get something out of it, too.
You get to find out where you stand... once and for all.
Ryan, hey.
Is everything okay?
'Cause you sounded really weird on the phone.
I need to know how you feel about Johnny.
So I take it Kaitlin paid you a visit.
This isn't about Kaitlin.
We both knew this was an issue long before she showed up.
I'm with you.
But that's not the whole story, is it?
Maybe you just feel sorry for him or... maybe sometimes you didn't think you can talk to me... or I wasn't listening... or maybe you're in love with him.
Either way, you got to figure it out.
Until then, I...
I don't want to see you.
Look, I know things have been confusing...
Hey.
Morning.
Oh, no, the Atwood grunt.
That's never a good sign.
What's the matter?
I'm going to guess.
Marissa.
Or Johnny.
Maybe Kaitlin.
I'm going to say probably a combo platter.
I think Marissa and I are on thin ice.
She needs to figure out her relationship with Johnny pronto.
She's, uh, got good taste in people.
I'm sure she'll do the right thing.
Speaking of the right thing...
Um...
I tried to talk to Summer.
And?
I chickened out.
Which is kind of my go-to move these days.
But I'm going to take care of it.
And I'm rescheduling the interview.
Think they're going to let you take it again after you blew the first one off?
Well, for the first one I had an epileptic fit.
And there was a three-car pileup on the freeway with a jackknifed trailer truck, so...
- All right, I'll work on my excuse.
- That's a good idea.
Oh, Kaitlin, you're up.
I was just making some grits.
Okay.
Mom, we get it.
We live in a trailer park.
There's no need to go overboard.
Marissa, you want some?
I'm not hungry.
Fine.
I'll go see if Gus likes these.
I mean, he does eat pigeons after all.
Be right back.
I'd kill for some Apple Jacks.
Do you think we have any?
Kaitlin, you had no right to talk to Ryan about my relationship with Johnny.
It's none of your business.
I was just sharing my opinion.
What did I ever do to you?
I mean, I know Mom ignores you and Dad left.
Okay, let's not turn this into family therapy.
Okay, then let's not pretend this is all about Johnny.
What else would this be about?
Come on, you're doing this to punish me.
You know, I was actually happy when you came home.
I thought we were gonna be friends again.
But now I just can't wait for you to leave.
Summer...
I just got off the phone with Mr. Spivey from Brown.
Looks like you've got a fan.
Oh, great.
You know, I was actually just curious.
Did he mention how I went with Seth?
Seth Cohen?
Yeah.
You know, gangly, mop-head, barely has an ass.
Right.
Um... unfortunately, Seth missed his interview.
- What?
- He was a no-show.
He was just in here explaining the situation.
Something about a tractor-trailer accident.
Oh, my God, that little bitch.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
Thank you for your help.
Well...
I finally heard from Dr. Roberts.
That's great.
Or not.
He had me set him up with Laura Cross.
They'll be eating at Al Fiorno's, a table by the window.
Oh, Julie, I'm sorry.
Oh, no, it's my own fault.
I let you do the scheming, clearly not your wheel house.
From now on, if someone needs to be manipulated, we put me in charge.
Fair enough.
Laura Cross...
I don't know her.
Well, she'll probably marry him and enjoy a life of free brow lifts.
Anyway...
I am going to get to know her and find out what I'm up against.
Don't tell me you're going to spy on them.
I tried taking your advice, Kiki, and quite frankly, it sucked.
From now on, we do things the Julie Cooper way.
Julie Cooper, be careful.
I see we have a problem.
Chili, man, I'm fine, all right, I just...
In love with Marissa Cooper.
My friend, in all my years of loving ladies and getting nothing in return
I have never been as bad off as you.
Thanks, man.
Makes me feel a lot better.
Normally...
I would advise you to go cold turkey.
Delete her number from your cell, spam-block her e-mails, and just hope that the obsession passes.
But I see that you are in deeper than this.
So what do I do?
You take a shot.
That way, even if she rejects you, at least you know you tried.
Yeah, and there's always a chance that she feels the same way, right?
Reasons abound.
The point is, you owe it to yourself to at least know whether or not she likes you.
You could have a drink tonight.
You sure?
Well, you've had a tough day.
So has Matt.
Looks like he's come here to drown his sorrows.
Oh.
Well, you should ask him to join us if he's all by himself.
Or not.
Ah, that's Maya Griffin.
O.C. Weekly just did a profile on her.
Apparently she's an up-and-coming Newpsie.
Wow, I have too much time on my hands.
Well, if she's the new queen, she's still got a lot to learn.
Well, why wouldn't she date him?
He's young and attractive.
He's using her.
Her father's the head of the board.
Are you going to talk to him?
Tomorrow.
Tonight, I'm out with my lovely, beautiful, morally uncompromised wife.
We could go to the Crab Shack, pick up something to go.
Sand dabs are in season.
Genius.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you, too.
Things have been...
Really weird between us.
I know.
Um...
That's just why I wanted to get everything out in the open.
Johnny, I don't know if now's the time to...
I love you... and I think you love me, too.
Johnny...
Look, okay, look what's happened between us.
I mean, I got hurt and you took care of me even when I begged you not to.
I know.
That's true.
But...
I told you to stay away from me and you showed up at my house.
I'm not imagining this, okay?
There's something real between us.
That's why neither of us can walk away.
Look... you don't have to say anything right now, okay?
Just, you know, think about it.
Morning.
Morning.
Hi, Ryan.
Feel like a bagel?
I do, thank you.
Ah, there's my son.
How are you?
Good.
Do we have poppy?
Oh, great.
How are you really?
Uh...
I'm really fine, Dad.
How are you?
I'm good.
I'm good.
Just making sure you're staying afloat.
I know you got a lot of stress.
Exams, college applications.
Yeah, no, not to worry.
It's all under control.
Oh, hey, Summer.
Hi.
Just in time for breakfast.
Oh, thanks, Mr. C.
Actually, I was wondering if I could talk to Seth upstairs... um, possibly alone.
Okay.
All right, so...
Ow!
What the hell?
You lied about your college interview, and I don't like liars!
I can explain.
Explain what, that you're pathological?
That you invent stories about college interviews that never even happened?
You make it sounds so bad.
Cohen, you are in a deceit spiral, and if you don't stop now, you could turn into one of those creepy old men who have secret attics where they hide stolen money and porn.
Okay, first of all, that sounds awesome.
Second of all, could be worse.
I got scared.
Scared?
Yeah.
Tongue-tied, uh, dizzy.
My bladder felt weak.
I just want to know why you didn't tell me.
Because I was embarrassed.
You've got this natural confidence.
You're small and you're cute.
People like you.
I'm a social outcast with a mumbling problem.
You're just realizing this now?
Well, if we go to college together, everybody's going to love you, and I'm going to be your nerdy boyfriend.
And I'm going to be your not-so-bright girlfriend that can't keep up when everyone's talking about Yakuza films and Prowst.
It's Proust.
See?
Look, we have to be honest with each other, or this is never going to work.
No, you're right.
So is there anything else you need to tell me?
'Cause now's your chance.
Just put it out on the table.
No.
Okay.
Then you are officially exonerated.
Thesaurus again.
You want to get down?
Hey.
I didn't know we were working this weekend.
I thought maybe you and I would go hit the links.
What, and ruin a sport I love?
It's the weekend, so I'm going to make this brief as I know how.
I was at dinner last night with Kirsten at the Yacht Club.
I saw you there... with Maya.
Henry Griffin told Maya about meeting with me, so she decided to get in touch.
She asked you to dinner.
She did.
Why?
Is it illegal to take a girl out to dinner?
You know, when Kirsten used to run this place,
I saw a lot of creeps in nice suits that used to try to use her to get to her father.
I didn't like it then, and I don't like it now.
We're trying to build a hospital that could service 100,000 uninsured.
You're trying to use a daughter to manipulate her father... and you're comfortable with that.
Look, Sandy, you're a great guy, but maybe you don't have the stomach for this.
All I'm saying is that we're going to have to bend the rules if we want to win the game.
That'd look great on a bumper sticker.
I want to see you on Monday with a real game plan.
All right.
Hey.
Um...
Kirsten let me in.
She seems really nice.
What do you want?
Look, um... you've always been a really good guy to me.
You know, you've helped me with Volchek, trusted me with Marissa...
Now you're in love with her.
I told her.
I-I promised myself I-I would just live with these feelings, you know--
I wouldn't do anything about them, but, um...
I just can't do that anymore.
What, do you want my blessing?
I guess I just... just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Thanks for that.
Leave now.
Well, I'm passionately devoted to my work on the board of the Children's Museum.
Children are so important, don't you think?
Oh, she's so phony.
Well, of course she is.
She lives in Newport.
Oh, God, mayday.
Taryn Baker just walked in.
Well, you'd better get out of there before she sees you.
Dinner with you, apparently.
Oh, too late.
Hi, Taryn.
Why are you all bundled up like that?
Has Newport been taken over by the Taliban?
I'd really love to stay and chat, but I have to be going...
Oh, my goodness, it's Laura Cross!
Laura, hi!
It's me, Taryn, from Orchid Club.
Oh, Taryn, of course.
Do you know Julie?
I have to go.
We haven't met.
Julie?
Julie?
Oh, my!
What a coincidence.
Have you been sitting at the next table this whole time?
Are you spying on me?
Uh...
I...
I'm sorry.
Hey.
There's a sale at Paul Frank if you want to go.
Probably can't afford anything, but we could try stuff on.
No thanks.
I'm guessing you're still mad at me.
Look, I know you may not believe me when I say this, but I'm trying to do you a favor.
Oh, yeah?
Well, thanks.
So far, it's been a real blast.
Remember when we were little, and Dad used to always take us to Baskin-Robbins?
You'd have to sample, like, every single flavor before you could decide on what you actually wanted, and then once you did, you realized that you didn't like it, so you'd cry.
Dad would have to take you back in to get another cone.
Is this another story about how growing up, it was always about me?
No.
It's about you not trusting your instincts.
Maybe I'm not built that way.
So?
It's a skill.
Learn it.
Make a decision and stick with it.
Remember what I used to always get?
Gold Medal Ribbon.
Every time.
I figured I loved it-- why question it?
Honey, you just missed Marissa.
Marissa?
Yeah.
She left this for you.
I'm sorry.
You want to be with Johnny.
No, I'm sorry I ever made you wonder.
Look, you two have a connection.
I get that.
It's not even about him.
No, it's... it's about me.
I was just... not being able to talk to you about Trey.
And then with Kaitlin coming back, her hooking up with Johnny, it just... it threw me for a loop.
But I think we can get past that.
It's not that easy.
You can't just snap your fingers and make everything go back the way it was before.
Well, we can try.
Maybe start with dinner?
Johnny.
Which Cooper are you here to see?
I'm here to see you.
I thought maybe we could go to the beach.
For a night surfing lesson?
I was thinking more like bonfire and tequila.
Even better.
Know where my mom keeps the stash.
So, what's the occasion?
Just feel like you and I never really got a chance to party.
What do you say?
Okay.
Hungry?
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
I...
I should've called.
Oh, it's okay.
I figured you were here.
Who would've thought the Newport Group would be where I go to for a moment of zen?
I know.
Sometimes this job makes you do a lot of hard thinking.
I want this hospital more than I've wanted anything in a long time.
Then you can't let Matt's relationship with Maya Griffin stand in your way.
For all you know, she could be using him, too, or they could live happily ever after.
The point is if you want this as bad as I think you do, you have to go for it.
So where's the line?
I'm not worried about you knowing where the line is.
You always do.
It's who you are.
Coming!
Cohen!
Hang on...
Cohen, why is the door locked?
Cohen, I brought some DVDs.
Save the Last Dance and She's All That.
Now, I know you're not interested in either of them, but I cannot watch another movie about Japanese people flying through the air.
Okay, that's fine.
Let's go downstairs.
Wait, what?
That's fine, but are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great.
Come on.
What's that smell?
It is incense.
I was doing yoga, plus I had some really bad gas.
Gross.
Oh, God, wish I'd brought something to mix it with.
Couple more sips, you won't even notice.
Okay, alkie.
Can we just hook up already?
Or, before you pass out on me.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Well, it's just the fire.
It's so romantic.
Well, the fire is, actually, kind of dying.
Well, okay then.
I'll just go find some driftwood.
Heat things up a bit.
What's that?
Nothing I want to remember.
Where are you going?
To climb up there.
Okay, tequila and rock climbing, I'm not exactly sure that's the best combination.
So don't come.
Johnny, wait.
Go away, Gus.
I told you, I don't play strip pinochle.
You play strip pinochle?
Long story.
What...
What are you doing here?
I stopped by to thank you for fixing me up with Laura.
She's a wonderful woman.
Well, good.
I'm glad it worked out with the two of you.
If you'll excuse me, I have a Hot Pocket in the microwave and a wine cooler with my name on it, so good luck.
What?
What do you want?
You.
Excuse me?
You can be manipulative, you can be aggressive,
I've know you to stretch the truth on occasion.
But the fact is, when I'm not around you, I miss you.
You do?
What can I say?
I've fallen for you.
Well... this just may be your lucky night.
I have an extra Hot Pocket.
Johnny, would you just come down already?
You're wasted.
No, I'm not wasted.
Johnny, just come down.
Stop it, that's high enought.
I'm not gonna fall.
You're scaring me.
I got it.
You're awesome.
Just stop!
Johnny!
It's okay.
Johnny!
Did you see?
Johnny, just come down.
I almost dropped it.
It's okay, I got it.
Johnny, please!
Just come down.
Seth's really into that movie.
Yeah, I know, and he ate all of our dumplings.
Look, I know it's gonna take more than Thai food and teen movies to sort this out, but if you want to talk...
Talking is the last thing I feel like doing.
I figured, since you gave me the silent treatment the whole way in the car.
What do you want from me?
I want you.
You want to answer that?
Not really.
Wait.
It's Kaitlin.
Ah, she's setting the mood.
All right, let me just get rid of her.
Setting the mood.
Tell her that...
Wait.
Kaitlin, let me call you back.
Marissa, can you come and get me?
I'm at Westward Cove with Johnny.
No, I'm busy.
You're getting busy.
No, but you don't understand.
I'm scared.
He's drunk and he's acting like a crazy person.
Hey, come up here!
You got to see this view!
Johnny, just come down.
What's that?
Marissa, it's him, I'm telling you.
Johnny's in trouble and I don't know what to do.
Um, hold on.
She sounds really upset.
It's Johnny?
Yeah, he's in trouble.
Kaitlin?
Ryan, you have to help me.
He's drunk and he's gonna get hurt.
He's really in trouble?
Yes.
Come now.
We'll be right there.
Wow.
So that was, um... that was Save the Last Dance, uh?
Okay, I know there weren't any subtitles or kung fu or whatever,
- but I thought it was pretty good.
- No, I thought it was amazing.
That dance number at the end was so inspiring.
And Summer, I'm so glad...
I'm so, so glad, that she got into Julliard in the end.
And she did it for her mom.
For her mom, Summer.
Yeah, it wasn't that good.
This is pretty amazing, too.
It's just a blue screen, Cohen.
I know, but it's so blue.
I never realized how blue it was before.
I kind of, like, want to go swimming in it or something.
Yeah.
For a little dippy-dip.
Okay, it's pretty blue.
Yeah.
Could you excuse me, I got to go to the bathroom.
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
We should, we should take our pants off.
Come on, Captain Oats.
We both know something's up.
Ew.
Over there.
You go to Kaitlin.
I'm gonna find another way up there.
- Keep him talking.
- Okay.
Be careful.
Johnny, just come down!
Kaitlin.
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm so happy that you're here.
Marissa!
Johnny...
look, you have to get down from there.
Go home!
I don't have anything to say to you.
Look, we can get through this, all right?
I mean, you're one of my best friends.
After all we've been through, I get to be your best friend?
Go away.
Leave me alone.
Come on, let me explain it to you.
Look, just come down, Johnny.
Dude, you are the last person I want to see right now.
Okay, all right, let's get you down from there.
We can talk about it later, okay?
Right, right.
So you can save me one more time for Marissa.
Hey, Marissa!
Marissa!
You want to watch Ryan save me again?
!
Just come down, Johnny, please!
So she'll love you even more.
Okay, just be careful, all right?
What, I might fall, you get to come in and grab me at the last second?
Ryan Atwood saves the...
Previously, on The O.C.--
Do you think that Marissa would mind if I invited Johnny?
She seemed a little weird when she saw us together last night.
But they're just friends, so why would it matter?
I love Ryan.
It doesn't mean that you don't like Johnny.
I don't.
Then you wouldn't mind that I just made out with him upstairs.
We both have very complex lives, and... maybe we should consider all of the implications before going further.
Are we building a hospital?
Is it too late for a new approach?
Let's do it your way.
You're trying to take care of me.
The least I can do is take care of you.
Caleb would've been proud.
We got it.
Sandy, that's wonderful.
And you did it your way.
Yeah.
Cohen!
I got one!
Got an interview with the Brown guy.
Mrs. Rothschild just told me, and that you got one, too.
Please tell me it went okay.
It went great.
We totally bonded.
Are you high?
Am I high?
Ryan.
Ryan.
Come on, wake up.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Seth is gone.
What?
He's gone?
Yeah.
His alarm went off, I went into his room, his bed his empty.
Uh... calc exam.
Calc exam?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, he probably just went in early to school to cram for it.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna drive over there to make sure.
No, no.
I'll go.
I'll go.
I got to get to school early anyway.
If there was anything going on with, Seth, anything I should know, you would tell me, right?
Yeah.
I'll call you, uh, when I find him.
Hey, man.
So, uh, Sandy noticed you're gone-- he's worried.
Just taking in the sunrise, Ryan.
Yeah, that's what they have windows for.
So I wanted to be alone-- are you the only one in this family that's allowed to brood?
Man, whatever it is, you can tell me.
My Brown interview did not go... so well.
Actually, it didn't go at all.
You blew it off?
Yep.
And then to put the cherry on top of that, I went ahead and lied to Summer about it.
Right.
Well...
I don't know, talk to her.
Yeah, see, Summer was over pot by the tenth grade.
She thinks it's totally juvenile-- it'd be like telling her I'm into Beanie Babies.
Well, you know, at least tell her that you missed the interview.
You do that, and I'll keep quiet about the rest of it.
We're getting dangerously close to an after-school special here, Ryan.
It's marijuana, and I did it twice.
So you're telling me you didn't come down here to buy a bag?
Fine, I wasn't gonna smoke anymore anyways.
What are you doing?
Trying to decide on a bathing suit.
Do you think tankinis are over?
You're going swimming?
No.
Johnny's taking me for a surf lesson.
He says the waves are always best in the morning.
That's what I hear.
Look...
I know that you're mad about me and Johnny.
I'm not mad.
Do I look mad?
Okay, we may not be BFFs, but you're my sister, and I can tell when you're mad.
Kaitlin, look in my eyes.
I don't care about you and Johnny.
You have a boyfriend.
So Johnny Harbor's fair game, right?
I'm not talking about this.
Can you honestly tell me you have no feelings for him?
That's what I thought.
Hey.
You're right on time.
Sorry, I didn't mean to walk in on anything.
No problem.
You ready to surf?
Uh, I got to go.
Enjoy the beach.
Katy Rubell, 39, single.
Loves tennis, loves working out.
Do we have anyone for her?
I say she dies alone.
Julie!
I'm sorry, I just can't focus on fixing other people's love lives when my own is such a mess.
Dr. Roberts will call you.
Or if you want, you could call him.
I know you've been married for, like, 200 years, but you must remember something about dating.
Well, I hope so, or I'm in the wrong business.
Maybe that's the answer.
Pitch Dr. Roberts the dating service, set him up.
Set him up?
Are you high?
No, I'm serious.
Then you'll be back on his radar and it won't seem like you're pursuing him.
I like it.
I'm aloof but thoughtful.
And when he's confronted with the idea of dating these Newpsies...
Half of whom he's Botox'd himself.
...he will realize that the only woman he wants is you.
And he will call you for dinner.
I'll suggest Al Fiorno's, a table by the window.
I'm impressed.
You're sneakier than I thought, Kirsten Cohen.
Well, being around you all these years, it's rubbed off.
Hey.
Hey, Cohen.
Hey, did you write your thank you note yet to the Brown interviewer?
No.
Actually, that's something I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, you came to the right person, because I am master of the thank you note.
Listen to this.
"Thank you so much for the resplendent interview."
"Resplendent."
Yeah.
I bought a thesaurus.
Shelly loves SAT words.
Hey, I didn't know you two were on a first-name basis.
Oh, yeah, we totally power-bonded.
Which means I may actually have a chance of getting into Brown.
Do you know what that means?
No calling, no texting, no e-mailing-- just us together, isn't that great?
Yeah.
Okay, so tell me-- how did your interview really go?
Do you think you aced it?
I knocked it out of the park.
- Really?
!
- Yeah.
Yeah.
And it wasn't easy, believe me, but, you know, I turned on the Cohen charm, as usual, and... the lady swooned.
- Cohen?
- Yeah?
Shelly's a guy.
Is it because... yes, yes, you're...
I'm sor... correct.
But with the feminine energy, I don't know, I got a gay vibe,
I'm gender-blind, that's the thing, and that's something that I'm gonna have to work on at Brown next year when we go together, when we go together.
Okay, I'm gonna see you later.
I got to go.
- Cohen.
- We'll talk after school.
Wow, somebody was really craving caffeine.
Oh, yeah.
I can barely keep my eyes open.
Early morning wake-up call, courtesy of Seth.
Oh, has he told Summer yet?
No, and he's not going to.
By the way, I promised that, um, we'd keep quiet about it, as long as he told her about the interview.
Oh, I was looking forward to Summer bitch-slapping Kaitlin for giving Seth pot.
Guess she's just gonna get away with it, like always.
You know, it's for the best.
I mean, she screwed up, but she's still pretty much a kid.
Yeah.
But with my mom's DNA.
Which means she's capable of more than you think.
Um... are we still talking about Seth, or...
This is just sister stuff.
You know, I should probably get to class.
See you later.
Okay.
It's "just sister stuff"?
Okay, let's practice your pop-up one more time.
When you told me you were gonna give me a surfing lesson,
I kind of imagined us in the water.
No, no.
First lesson's always on the sand.
As long as we're skipping the water part, why don't we just do this back at your place?
Or we could just blow the whole thing off.
Rent a movie, order in pancakes.
I thought you said you wanted to learn how to surf.
I'm not training for the Olympics, okay?
Sorry.
I'm just distracted.
Thinking about Marissa.
Story of my life.
I like a guy, he's in love with my older sister...
Look, Marissa and I have a history together, all right?
It's... just complicated.
Uncomplicate it.
Do something.
I can't do anything.
It's not my place.
If you're too lame to do something, I'll just find somebody who will.
I thought this was a done deal.
Miriam already gave us the hospital contract.
He did.
And now he has to present it to the Board of Physicians.
Can't have a hospital without doctors.
Like or not, they got a say.
Right.
Now we have to ply more people with women and liquor.
I don't think that's gonna work.
These guys are doctors, not businessmen.
Then we got that in common.
Call it willful naiveté, call it bleary-eyed optimism.
You think we've got a shot.
Yeah.
There's over 100,000 uninsured that live in Orange County.
There's got to be some angle we can find to make that land on these guys.
Well, there is.
The head of the board, Henry Griffin.
Turns out we have a... a personal connection.
Well, now, there's a shocking turn of events.
It's his daughter, Maya.
She's a stripper, too?
No, she was a year ahead of me at Kellogg.
Now she's one of its most trusted advisors.
And she used to have a thing for me.
Well, who could blame her?
So now you want to wine and dine her, use her affection for you to manipulate her father.
Listen, it's no worse than the strippers we got for Bill Miriam.
Oh, I don't know.
I draw the line at family, Matt.
How about this?
How about we find a strategy that doesn't involve liquor or sexual favors?
Thank you.
I mean, gracias.
Julie?
Hi.
Uh, your receptionist told me you'd be home today, so I thought I'd come by and personally thank you for hosting Kaitlin's birthday party.
And as a token of my appreciation...
Bachelorettes of Newport?
You want to set me up?
Well, unless... you don't want to be set up.
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.
Because I can totally understand if a blind date seems like too much.
Let's see what you have there.
New match.
Wow, she's pretty.
Mmm, pear shaped.
But pretty.
Ooh.
Look at her, nice... smile.
Yeah.
Adult braces.
And her...
Julie, all of these women look fantastic.
It's going to take me a while to choose one.
Do you mind if I get back to you?
Finally, you're home.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were waiting for me.
Well, I just get kind of lonely while you guys are all at school.
Speaking of school, shouldn't you be going back to yours soon?
How many times do I have to tell you guys?
It's called mid-winter break.
It's long.
Apparently.
Look, I want to talk to you about Marissa.
This whole Johnny triangle we're all trapped in.
Triangle?
Well, now that I'm here, it's more like a square.
Well, anyway, see, I like him.
And I'm not getting anywhere because he thinks he's got a chance with Marissa.
Well, not that that's any of your business, but it's not the case.
I don't know.
See, today I asked her if she had feelings for him point blank.
She didn't deny it.
Well, thanks for the heads up.
I think Marissa and I can handle it ourselves.
So if you just want to...
Ryan, I want you to do something about it.
I mean, you're a man of action.
You throw punches at fires.
At least that's the guy I remember from two years ago.
We've all grown up since then.
So you're reformed now?
Congratulations.
Doesn't mean you still can't talk to her.
So you can hook up with Johnny?
You get something out of it, too.
You get to find out where you stand... once and for all.
Ryan, hey.
Is everything okay?
'Cause you sounded really weird on the phone.
I need to know how you feel about Johnny.
So I take it Kaitlin paid you a visit.
This isn't about Kaitlin.
We both knew this was an issue long before she showed up.
I'm with you.
But that's not the whole story, is it?
Maybe you just feel sorry for him or... maybe sometimes you didn't think you can talk to me... or I wasn't listening... or maybe you're in love with him.
Either way, you got to figure it out.
Until then, I...
I don't want to see you.
Look, I know things have been confusing...
Hey.
Morning.
Oh, no, the Atwood grunt.
That's never a good sign.
What's the matter?
I'm going to guess.
Marissa.
Or Johnny.
Maybe Kaitlin.
I'm going to say probably a combo platter.
I think Marissa and I are on thin ice.
She needs to figure out her relationship with Johnny pronto.
She's, uh, got good taste in people.
I'm sure she'll do the right thing.
Speaking of the right thing...
Um...
I tried to talk to Summer.
And?
I chickened out.
Which is kind of my go-to move these days.
But I'm going to take care of it.
And I'm rescheduling the interview.
Think they're going to let you take it again after you blew the first one off?
Well, for the first one I had an epileptic fit.
And there was a three-car pileup on the freeway with a jackknifed trailer truck, so...
- All right, I'll work on my excuse.
- That's a good idea.
Oh, Kaitlin, you're up.
I was just making some grits.
Okay.
Mom, we get it.
We live in a trailer park.
There's no need to go overboard.
Marissa, you want some?
I'm not hungry.
Fine.
I'll go see if Gus likes these.
I mean, he does eat pigeons after all.
Be right back.
I'd kill for some Apple Jacks.
Do you think we have any?
Kaitlin, you had no right to talk to Ryan about my relationship with Johnny.
It's none of your business.
I was just sharing my opinion.
What did I ever do to you?
I mean, I know Mom ignores you and Dad left.
Okay, let's not turn this into family therapy.
Okay, then let's not pretend this is all about Johnny.
What else would this be about?
Come on, you're doing this to punish me.
You know, I was actually happy when you came home.
I thought we were gonna be friends again.
But now I just can't wait for you to leave.
Summer...
I just got off the phone with Mr. Spivey from Brown.
Looks like you've got a fan.
Oh, great.
You know, I was actually just curious.
Did he mention how I went with Seth?
Seth Cohen?
Yeah.
You know, gangly, mop-head, barely has an ass.
Right.
Um... unfortunately, Seth missed his interview.
- What?
- He was a no-show.
He was just in here explaining the situation.
Something about a tractor-trailer accident.
Oh, my God, that little bitch.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
Thank you for your help.
Well...
I finally heard from Dr. Roberts.
That's great.
Or not.
He had me set him up with Laura Cross.
They'll be eating at Al Fiorno's, a table by the window.
Oh, Julie, I'm sorry.
Oh, no, it's my own fault.
I let you do the scheming, clearly not your wheel house.
From now on, if someone needs to be manipulated, we put me in charge.
Fair enough.
Laura Cross...
I don't know her.
Well, she'll probably marry him and enjoy a life of free brow lifts.
Anyway...
I am going to get to know her and find out what I'm up against.
Don't tell me you're going to spy on them.
I tried taking your advice, Kiki, and quite frankly, it sucked.
From now on, we do things the Julie Cooper way.
Julie Cooper, be careful.
I see we have a problem.
Chili, man, I'm fine, all right, I just...
In love with Marissa Cooper.
My friend, in all my years of loving ladies and getting nothing in return
I have never been as bad off as you.
Thanks, man.
Makes me feel a lot better.
Normally...
I would advise you to go cold turkey.
Delete her number from your cell, spam-block her e-mails, and just hope that the obsession passes.
But I see that you are in deeper than this.
So what do I do?
You take a shot.
That way, even if she rejects you, at least you know you tried.
Yeah, and there's always a chance that she feels the same way, right?
Reasons abound.
The point is, you owe it to yourself to at least know whether or not she likes you.
You could have a drink tonight.
You sure?
Well, you've had a tough day.
So has Matt.
Looks like he's come here to drown his sorrows.
Oh.
Well, you should ask him to join us if he's all by himself.
Or not.
Ah, that's Maya Griffin.
O.C. Weekly just did a profile on her.
Apparently she's an up-and-coming Newpsie.
Wow, I have too much time on my hands.
Well, if she's the new queen, she's still got a lot to learn.
Well, why wouldn't she date him?
He's young and attractive.
He's using her.
Her father's the head of the board.
Are you going to talk to him?
Tomorrow.
Tonight, I'm out with my lovely, beautiful, morally uncompromised wife.
We could go to the Crab Shack, pick up something to go.
Sand dabs are in season.
Genius.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you, too.
Things have been...
Really weird between us.
I know.
Um...
That's just why I wanted to get everything out in the open.
Johnny, I don't know if now's the time to...
I love you... and I think you love me, too.
Johnny...
Look, okay, look what's happened between us.
I mean, I got hurt and you took care of me even when I begged you not to.
I know.
That's true.
But...
I told you to stay away from me and you showed up at my house.
I'm not imagining this, okay?
There's something real between us.
That's why neither of us can walk away.
Look... you don't have to say anything right now, okay?
Just, you know, think about it.
Morning.
Morning.
Hi, Ryan.
Feel like a bagel?
I do, thank you.
Ah, there's my son.
How are you?
Good.
Do we have poppy?
Oh, great.
How are you really?
Uh...
I'm really fine, Dad.
How are you?
I'm good.
I'm good.
Just making sure you're staying afloat.
I know you got a lot of stress.
Exams, college applications.
Yeah, no, not to worry.
It's all under control.
Oh, hey, Summer.
Hi.
Just in time for breakfast.
Oh, thanks, Mr. C.
Actually, I was wondering if I could talk to Seth upstairs... um, possibly alone.
Okay.
All right, so...
Ow!
What the hell?
You lied about your college interview, and I don't like liars!
I can explain.
Explain what, that you're pathological?
That you invent stories about college interviews that never even happened?
You make it sounds so bad.
Cohen, you are in a deceit spiral, and if you don't stop now, you could turn into one of those creepy old men who have secret attics where they hide stolen money and porn.
Okay, first of all, that sounds awesome.
Second of all, could be worse.
I got scared.
Scared?
Yeah.
Tongue-tied, uh, dizzy.
My bladder felt weak.
I just want to know why you didn't tell me.
Because I was embarrassed.
You've got this natural confidence.
You're small and you're cute.
People like you.
I'm a social outcast with a mumbling problem.
You're just realizing this now?
Well, if we go to college together, everybody's going to love you, and I'm going to be your nerdy boyfriend.
And I'm going to be your not-so-bright girlfriend that can't keep up when everyone's talking about Yakuza films and Prowst.
It's Proust.
See?
Look, we have to be honest with each other, or this is never going to work.
No, you're right.
So is there anything else you need to tell me?
'Cause now's your chance.
Just put it out on the table.
No.
Okay.
Then you are officially exonerated.
Thesaurus again.
You want to get down?
Hey.
I didn't know we were working this weekend.
I thought maybe you and I would go hit the links.
What, and ruin a sport I love?
It's the weekend, so I'm going to make this brief as I know how.
I was at dinner last night with Kirsten at the Yacht Club.
I saw you there... with Maya.
Henry Griffin told Maya about meeting with me, so she decided to get in touch.
She asked you to dinner.
She did.
Why?
Is it illegal to take a girl out to dinner?
You know, when Kirsten used to run this place,
I saw a lot of creeps in nice suits that used to try to use her to get to her father.
I didn't like it then, and I don't like it now.
We're trying to build a hospital that could service 100,000 uninsured.
You're trying to use a daughter to manipulate her father... and you're comfortable with that.
Look, Sandy, you're a great guy, but maybe you don't have the stomach for this.
All I'm saying is that we're going to have to bend the rules if we want to win the game.
That'd look great on a bumper sticker.
I want to see you on Monday with a real game plan.
All right.
Hey.
Um...
Kirsten let me in.
She seems really nice.
What do you want?
Look, um... you've always been a really good guy to me.
You know, you've helped me with Volchek, trusted me with Marissa...
Now you're in love with her.
I told her.
I-I promised myself I-I would just live with these feelings, you know--
I wouldn't do anything about them, but, um...
I just can't do that anymore.
What, do you want my blessing?
I guess I just... just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Thanks for that.
Leave now.
Well, I'm passionately devoted to my work on the board of the Children's Museum.
Children are so important, don't you think?
Oh, she's so phony.
Well, of course she is.
She lives in Newport.
Oh, God, mayday.
Taryn Baker just walked in.
Well, you'd better get out of there before she sees you.
Dinner with you, apparently.
Oh, too late.
Hi, Taryn.
Why are you all bundled up like that?
Has Newport been taken over by the Taliban?
I'd really love to stay and chat, but I have to be going...
Oh, my goodness, it's Laura Cross!
Laura, hi!
It's me, Taryn, from Orchid Club.
Oh, Taryn, of course.
Do you know Julie?
I have to go.
We haven't met.
Julie?
Julie?
Oh, my!
What a coincidence.
Have you been sitting at the next table this whole time?
Are you spying on me?
Uh...
I...
I'm sorry.
Hey.
There's a sale at Paul Frank if you want to go.
Probably can't afford anything, but we could try stuff on.
No thanks.
I'm guessing you're still mad at me.
Look, I know you may not believe me when I say this, but I'm trying to do you a favor.
Oh, yeah?
Well, thanks.
So far, it's been a real blast.
Remember when we were little, and Dad used to always take us to Baskin-Robbins?
You'd have to sample, like, every single flavor before you could decide on what you actually wanted, and then once you did, you realized that you didn't like it, so you'd cry.
Dad would have to take you back in to get another cone.
Is this another story about how growing up, it was always about me?
No.
It's about you not trusting your instincts.
Maybe I'm not built that way.
So?
It's a skill.
Learn it.
Make a decision and stick with it.
Remember what I used to always get?
Gold Medal Ribbon.
Every time.
I figured I loved it-- why question it?
Honey, you just missed Marissa.
Marissa?
Yeah.
She left this for you.
I'm sorry.
You want to be with Johnny.
No, I'm sorry I ever made you wonder.
Look, you two have a connection.
I get that.
It's not even about him.
No, it's... it's about me.
I was just... not being able to talk to you about Trey.
And then with Kaitlin coming back, her hooking up with Johnny, it just... it threw me for a loop.
But I think we can get past that.
It's not that easy.
You can't just snap your fingers and make everything go back the way it was before.
Well, we can try.
Maybe start with dinner?
Johnny.
Which Cooper are you here to see?
I'm here to see you.
I thought maybe we could go to the beach.
For a night surfing lesson?
I was thinking more like bonfire and tequila.
Even better.
Know where my mom keeps the stash.
So, what's the occasion?
Just feel like you and I never really got a chance to party.
What do you say?
Okay.
Hungry?
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
I...
I should've called.
Oh, it's okay.
I figured you were here.
Who would've thought the Newport Group would be where I go to for a moment of zen?
I know.
Sometimes this job makes you do a lot of hard thinking.
I want this hospital more than I've wanted anything in a long time.
Then you can't let Matt's relationship with Maya Griffin stand in your way.
For all you know, she could be using him, too, or they could live happily ever after.
The point is if you want this as bad as I think you do, you have to go for it.
So where's the line?
I'm not worried about you knowing where the line is.
You always do.
It's who you are.
Coming!
Cohen!
Hang on...
Cohen, why is the door locked?
Cohen, I brought some DVDs.
Save the Last Dance and She's All That.
Now, I know you're not interested in either of them, but I cannot watch another movie about Japanese people flying through the air.
Okay, that's fine.
Let's go downstairs.
Wait, what?
That's fine, but are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great.
Come on.
What's that smell?
It is incense.
I was doing yoga, plus I had some really bad gas.
Gross.
Oh, God, wish I'd brought something to mix it with.
Couple more sips, you won't even notice.
Okay, alkie.
Can we just hook up already?
Or, before you pass out on me.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Well, it's just the fire.
It's so romantic.
Well, the fire is, actually, kind of dying.
Well, okay then.
I'll just go find some driftwood.
Heat things up a bit.
What's that?
Nothing I want to remember.
Where are you going?
To climb up there.
Okay, tequila and rock climbing, I'm not exactly sure that's the best combination.
So don't come.
Johnny, wait.
Go away, Gus.
I told you, I don't play strip pinochle.
You play strip pinochle?
Long story.
What...
What are you doing here?
I stopped by to thank you for fixing me up with Laura.
She's a wonderful woman.
Well, good.
I'm glad it worked out with the two of you.
If you'll excuse me, I have a Hot Pocket in the microwave and a wine cooler with my name on it, so good luck.
What?
What do you want?
You.
Excuse me?
You can be manipulative, you can be aggressive,
I've know you to stretch the truth on occasion.
But the fact is, when I'm not around you, I miss you.
You do?
What can I say?
I've fallen for you.
Well... this just may be your lucky night.
I have an extra Hot Pocket.
Johnny, would you just come down already?
You're wasted.
No, I'm not wasted.
Johnny, just come down.
Stop it, that's high enought.
I'm not gonna fall.
You're scaring me.
I got it.
You're awesome.
Just stop!
Johnny!
It's okay.
Johnny!
Did you see?
Johnny, just come down.
I almost dropped it.
It's okay, I got it.
Johnny, please!
Just come down.
Seth's really into that movie.
Yeah, I know, and he ate all of our dumplings.
Look, I know it's gonna take more than Thai food and teen movies to sort this out, but if you want to talk...
Talking is the last thing I feel like doing.
I figured, since you gave me the silent treatment the whole way in the car.
What do you want from me?
I want you.
You want to answer that?
Not really.
Wait.
It's Kaitlin.
Ah, she's setting the mood.
All right, let me just get rid of her.
Setting the mood.
Tell her that...
Wait.
Kaitlin, let me call you back.
Marissa, can you come and get me?
I'm at Westward Cove with Johnny.
No, I'm busy.
You're getting busy.
No, but you don't understand.
I'm scared.
He's drunk and he's acting like a crazy person.
Hey, come up here!
You got to see this view!
Johnny, just come down.
What's that?
Marissa, it's him, I'm telling you.
Johnny's in trouble and I don't know what to do.
Um, hold on.
She sounds really upset.
It's Johnny?
Yeah, he's in trouble.
Kaitlin?
Ryan, you have to help me.
He's drunk and he's gonna get hurt.
He's really in trouble?
Yes.
Come now.
We'll be right there.
Wow.
So that was, um... that was Save the Last Dance, uh?
Okay, I know there weren't any subtitles or kung fu or whatever,
- but I thought it was pretty good.
- No, I thought it was amazing.
That dance number at the end was so inspiring.
And Summer, I'm so glad...
I'm so, so glad, that she got into Julliard in the end.
And she did it for her mom.
For her mom, Summer.
Yeah, it wasn't that good.
This is pretty amazing, too.
It's just a blue screen, Cohen.
I know, but it's so blue.
I never realized how blue it was before.
I kind of, like, want to go swimming in it or something.
Yeah.
For a little dippy-dip.
Okay, it's pretty blue.
Yeah.
Could you excuse me, I got to go to the bathroom.
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
We should, we should take our pants off.
Come on, Captain Oats.
We both know something's up.
Ew.
Over there.
You go to Kaitlin.
I'm gonna find another way up there.
- Keep him talking.
- Okay.
Be careful.
Johnny, just come down!
Kaitlin.
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm so happy that you're here.
Marissa!
Johnny...
look, you have to get down from there.
Go home!
I don't have anything to say to you.
Look, we can get through this, all right?
I mean, you're one of my best friends.
After all we've been through, I get to be your best friend?
Go away.
Leave me alone.
Come on, let me explain it to you.
Look, just come down, Johnny.
Dude, you are the last person I want to see right now.
Okay, all right, let's get you down from there.
We can talk about it later, okay?
Right, right.
So you can save me one more time for Marissa.
Hey, Marissa!
Marissa!
You want to watch Ryan save me again?
!
Just come down, Johnny, please!
So she'll love you even more.
Okay, just be careful, all right?
What, I might fall, you get to come in and grab me at the last second?
Ryan Atwood saves the...

Raceman Synchro:
Amariss
Previously on The O.C.:
Do you think that Marissa would mind if I invited Johnny?
She seemed a little weird when she saw us together last night.
But they're just friends, so why would it matter?
I love Ryan.
- It doesn't mean you don't like Johnny.
- I don't.
Then you wouldn't mind that I just made out with him upstairs.
We both have very complex lives and maybe we should consider all the implications before going further.
Are we building a hospital?
- Is it too late for a new approach?
- Let's do it your way.
You're trying to take care of me.
The least I can do is take care of you.
- Caleb would've been proud.
- We got it.
Sandy, that's wonderful.
And you did it your way.
Yeah.
Cohen!
I got one.
An interview with the Brown guy.
Rushfield told me, and you got one too.
Please tell me it went okay.
It went great.
We totally bonded.
Are you high?
Am I high?
Ryan.
Ryan.
Come on, wake up.
- Hi.
What's wrong?
- Seth is gone.
- What?
He's gone?
- Yeah.
His alarm went off, I went into his room, his bed is empty.
- Calc exam.
- Calc exam?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He probably just went in early to school, cram for it.
- I'm gonna drive there to make sure.
- No, no, I'll go.
I'll go.
I gotta get to school early anyway.
If there was anything going on with Seth, anything I should know you would tell me, right?
Yeah.
I'll call you when I find him.
Hey, man.
So Sandy noticed you're gone.
He's worried.
- Just taking in the sunrise, Ryan.
- That's what they got windows for.
So I wanted to be alone.
Are you the only one that's allowed to brood?
Man, whatever it is, you can tell me.
My Brown interview did not go so well.
Actually, it didn't go at all.
- You blew it off?
- Yep.
Then to put the cherry on top, I went ahead and lied to Summer about it.
Right.
Well, I don't know, talk to her.
Yeah, it's just, Summer was over pot by the 10th grade.
She thinks it's juvenile.
It's like telling her I'm into Beanie Babies.
At least tell her you missed the interview.
You do that, and I'll keep quiet about the rest.
We're getting dangerously close to an after-school special.
It's marijuana, I did it twice.
So you're telling me you didn't come down here to buy a bag?
Fine, I wasn't gonna smoke anymore anyways.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to decide on a bathing suit.
- Do you think tankinis are over?
- You're going swimming?
No.
Johnny's taking me for a surf lesson.
Says the waves are best in the morning.
That's what I hear.
Look, I know that you're mad about me and Johnny.
I'm not mad.
Do I look mad?
Okay, we may not be BFFs but you're my sister, and I can tell when you're mad.
Kaitlin, look in my eyes.
I don't care about you and Johnny.
You have a boyfriend.
So Johnny Harper's fair game, right?
I'm not talking about this.
Can you honestly tell me you have no feelings for him?
That's what I thought.
Hey.
You're right on time.
Sorry, I didn't mean to walk in on anything.
- No problem.
You ready to surf?
- I gotta go.
Enjoy the beach.
Katie Rubel, 39, single.
Loves tennis, loves working out.
- Do we have anyone for her?
- I say she dies alone.
- Julie.
- I'm sorry.
I just can't focus on fixing other people's love lives when my own is such a mess.
Dr. Roberts will call you.
Or if you want, you could call him.
I know you've been married for 200 years but you must remember something about dating.
Well, I hope so, or I'm in the wrong business.
Maybe that's the answer.
Pitch Dr. Roberts the dating service, set him up.
- Set him up?
Are you high?
- No, I'm serious.
Then you'll be back on his radar, and it won't seem like you're pursuing him.
I like it.
I'm aloof, but thoughtful.
When he confronts the idea of dating these Newpsies...
Half of whom he's botoxed himself.
- he will realize that the only woman he wants is you.
- And he will call you for dinner.
- I'll suggest Al Forno's.
A table by the window.
I'm impressed.
You're sneakier than I thought, Kirsten Cohen.
Well, being around you all these years, it's rubbed off.
- Hey.
- Hey, Cohen.
Hey, did you write your thank-you note yet to the Brown interviewer?
No, actually, that's something I wanted to talk to you about.
You came to the right person, because I am master of the thank-you note.
Listen to this.
"Thank you so much for the resplendent interview."
- Resplendent?
- Yeah.
I bought a thesaurus.
Shelley loves SAT words.
I didn't know you two were on a first-name basis.
Oh, yeah, we totally power-bonded.
Which means I may have a chance of getting into Brown.
You know what that means?
No calling, texting, e-mailing.
- Just us together.
Isn't that great?
- Yeah.
So tell me, how did your interview really go?
Do you think you aced it?
- I knocked it out of the park.
- Really?
Yeah, yeah, and it wasn't easy, believe me.
But, you know, I turned on the Cohen charm, as usual and the lady swooned.
- Cohen.
- Yeah.
Shelley's a guy.
Is it because...?
Yes, yes.
You're...
I'm sorry.
Correct.
But with a feminine energy.
I got a gay vibe.
I'm gender-blind, that's the thing.
That's something that I'm gonna have to work on at Brown, next year, when we go together.
When we go together.
- I'm gonna see you later.
I gotta go.
- Cohen.
We'll talk after school.
Wow, somebody was really craving caffeine.
Yeah.
I can barely keep my eyes open.
Early-morning wake-up call, courtesy of Seth.
- Oh, has he told Summer yet?
- No, and he's not going to.
By the way, I promised that we'd keep quiet about it as long as he told her about the interview.
I was looking forward to Summer bitch-slapping Kaitlin for giving Seth pot.
- Gonna get away with it, like always.
- Maybe that's best.
I mean, she screwed up, but she's still pretty much a kid.
Yeah, but with my mom's DNA.
Which means she's capable of more than you think.
- Are we still talking about Seth?
- This is just sister stuff.
You know, I should probably get to class.
See you later.
Okay.
It's just sister stuff?
Okay, let's practice your pop-up one more time.
When you told me you were gonna give me a surfing lesson I kind of imagined us in the water.
No, no.
First lesson's always on the sand.
As long as we're skipping the water part, let's do this back at your place.
Or we could just blow the whole thing off.
Rent a movie, order in pancakes.
You said you wanted to learn how to surf.
I'm not training for the Olympics, okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm just distracted.
Thinking about Marissa.
Story of my life.
I like a guy, he's in love with my older sister.
Look, Marissa and I have a history together, all right?
- It's just complicated.
- Uncomplicate it.
- Do something.
- I can't do anything.
It's not my place.
If you're too lame to do something, I'll just find somebody who will.
I thought this was a done deal.
Merriam gave us the contract.
He did.
Now he has to present it to the board of physicians.
Can't have a hospital without doctors.
Like it or not, they got a say.
Oh, great.
Now we have to ply more people with women and liquor.
I don't think that's gonna work.
They're doctors, not businessmen.
Then we got that in common.
Call it willful naiveté, call it bleary-eyed optimism.
- You think we've got a shot?
- Yeah.
There's over 100,000 uninsured that live in Orange County.
There's got to be some angle we can find to make that land on these guys.
Well, there is.
The head of the board, Henry Griffin...
Turns out we have a personal connection.
Well, now, there's a shocking turn of events.
- It's his daughter, Maya.
- She's a stripper too?
No, she was a year ahead of me at Kellogg.
Now she's his most trusted adviser.
She used to have a thing for me.
Well, who could blame her?
So now you wanna wine and dine her.
Use her affection for you to manipulate her father.
Listen, it's no worse than the strippers we got for Bill Merriam.
Oh, I don't know.
I draw the line at family, Matt.
How about this?
How about we find a strategy that doesn't involve liquor or sexual favors?
Thank you.
I mean, gracias.
- Julie.
- Hi.
Your receptionist told me you'd be home today so I thought I'd come by and personally thank you for hosting Kaitlin's birthday party.
And as a token of my appreciation:
"Bachelorettes of Newport"?
- You wanna set me up?
- Well, unless you don't wanna be set up.
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.
Because I can totally understand if a blind date seems like too much.
Let's see what you have there.
- NewMatch.
Wow, she's pretty.
- Pear-shaped, but pretty.
- Look at her.
Nice smile.
- Yeah.
Adult braces.
And her.
Julie, all of these women look fantastic.
It's gonna take me a while to choose one.
Mind if I get back to you?
Finally.
You're home.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were waiting for me.
Well, I just get kind of lonely while you guys are all at school.
Speaking of school, shouldn't you be going back to yours soon?
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's called mid-winter break.
It's long.
- Apparently.
- Look, I wanna talk to you about Marissa.
This whole Johnny triangle we're all trapped in.
Triangle?
Now that I'm here, it's more like a square.
Well, anyway, see, I like him.
And I'm not getting anywhere because he thinks he's got a chance with Marissa.
Well, not that that's any of your business, but it's not the case.
I don't know.
See, today I asked her if she had feelings for him, point-blank.
She didn't deny it.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Marissa and I can handle it ourselves.
So if you just wanna...
Ryan, I want you to do something about it.
I mean, you're a man of action.
You throw punches, set fires.
That's the guy I remember from two years ago.
- We've all grown up since then.
- You're reformed now.
Congratulations.
- Doesn't mean you still can't talk to her.
- So you can hook up with Johnny?
You get something out of it too.
You get to find out where you stand.
Once and for all.
Ryan, hey.
Is everything okay?
You sounded really weird on the phone.
I need to know how you feel about Johnny.
- So I take it Kaitlin paid you a visit.
- This isn't about Kaitlin.
We both knew this was an issue long before she showed up.
- I'm with you.
- But that's not the whole story, is it?
Look, maybe you just feel sorry for him.
Or maybe sometimes you didn't think you could talk to me or I wasn't listening.
Or maybe you're in love with him.
Either way, you gotta figure it out.
Until then, I don't wanna see you.
Look, I know things have been confusing...
Hey.
Morning.
Oh, no, the Atwood grunt.
That's never a good sign.
What's the matter?
Let me guess, Marissa or Johnny.
Maybe Kaitlin.
I'm gonna say probably a combo platter.
- I think Marissa and I are on thin ice.
- No.
She needs to figure out her relationship with Johnny, pronto.
She's got good taste in people.
I'm sure she'll do the right thing.
Speaking of the right thing...
- I tried to talk to Summer.
- And?
I chickened out.
Which is kind of my go-to move these days.
But I'm gonna take care of it, I'm rescheduling the interview.
Think they'll let you after you blew the first one off?
Well, for the first one, I had an epileptic fit.
There was a three-car pileup on the freeway with a jackknifed truck, so...
- All right, I'll work on my excuse.
- That's a good idea.
And, Rita, when did you first find out that he was cheating on you?
- You mean, the first time?
- Oh, Kaitlin, you're up.
I was just making some grits.
Okay, Mom, we get it.
We live in a trailer park.
- There's no need to go overboard.
- Marissa, you want some?
- I'm not hungry.
- Fine.
I'll go see if Gus likes these.
I mean, he does eat pigeons after all.
Be right back.
I'd kill for some Apple Jacks.
Do you think we have any?
Kaitlin, you had no right to talk to Ryan about my relationship with Johnny.
- It's none of your business.
- I was sharing my opinion.
What did I ever do to you?
I mean, I know Mom ignores you and Dad left...
- Let's not turn this into family therapy.
- Let's not pretend it's all about Johnny.
- What else would this be about?
- You're doing this to punish me.
You know, I was happy when you came home.
I thought we were gonna be friends.
But now I just can't wait for you to leave.
Summer.
I just got off the phone with Mr. Spivey from Brown.
- Looks like you've got a fan.
- Oh, great.
I was just curious, did he mention how it went with Seth?
Seth Cohen?
Yeah.
Gangly, mop head, barely has an ass.
Right.
Unfortunately, Seth missed his interview.
- What?
- He was a no-show.
He was just here explaining the situation.
Something about a tractor-trailer accident.
- Oh, my God, that little bitch.
- Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
Thank you for your help.
- Well, I finally heard from Dr. Roberts.
- That's great.
- Or not.
- He had me set him up with Laura Cross.
They'll be eating at Al Forno's.
Table by the window.
- Oh, Julie, I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, it's my own fault.
I let you do the scheming.
Clearly, not your wheelhouse.
From now on, if someone needs to be manipulated we put me in charge.
- Fair enough.
Laura Cross, I don't know her.
Well, she'll probably marry him and enjoy a life of free browlifts.
Anyway, I am going to get to know her and find out what I'm up against.
Don't tell me you're gonna spy on them.
I tried taking your advice, Kiki, and quite frankly, it sucked.
From now on, we do things the Julie Cooper way.
Julie Cooper, be careful.
- I see we have a problem.
- Chili, man, I'm fine, all right?
- I'm just...
- In love with Marissa Cooper.
In all my years of loving ladies and getting nothing in return I have never been as bad off as you.
Thanks.
It makes me feel a lot better.
Normally, I would advise you to go cold turkey.
Delete her number from your cell, spam-block her e-mails and hope the obsession passes, but I see that you are in deeper than this.
- So, what do I do?
- Take a shot.
That way, even if she rejects you, at least you know you tried.
Yeah, and there's always the chance that she feels the same way, right?
Reasons abound.
The point is, you owe it to yourself to at least know whether or not she likes you.
- You could have a drink tonight.
- You sure?
Well, you've had a tough day.
So has Matt.
Looks like he's come here to drown his sorrows.
Oh, well, you should ask him to join us if he's all by himself.
Or not.
Oh, that's Maya Griffin.
OC Weekly did a profile on her.
Apparently, she's an up-and-coming Newpsie.
Wow, I have too much time on my hands.
If she's the new queen, she's got a lot to learn.
Well, why wouldn't she date him?
He's young and attractive.
He's using her.
Her father's the head of the board.
Are you gonna talk to him?
Tomorrow.
Tonight, I'm out with my lovely, beautiful, morally uncompromised wife.
We could go to the Crab Shack.
Pick up something to go?
Sand dabs are in season.
Genius.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you too.
- Things have been really...
- Really weird between us.
I know.
That's why I wanted to get everything out.
Johnny, I don't know if now's the time...
I love you.
And I think you love me too.
- Johnny.
- Look what's happened between us.
I mean, I got hurt, and you took care of me, even when I begged you not to.
I know.
That's true, but...
I told you to stay away from me, and you showed up at my house.
I'm not imagining this, okay?
There's something real between us.
That's why neither of us can walk away.
Look, you don't have to say anything right now, okay?
Just, you know, think about it.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Hi, Ryan.
Feel like a bagel?
- I do.
Thank you.
- There's my son.
How are you?
- Good.
Do we have poppy?
Oh, great.
- How are you, really?
- I'm really fine, Dad.
How are you?
Good.
Just making sure you're staying afloat.
I know you got lots of stress.
Exams, college applications.
- Yeah, not to worry.
It's all under control.
- Oh, hey, Summer.
- Hi.
- Just in time for breakfast.
- Oh, thanks, Mr. C.
Actually, I was wondering if I could talk to Seth upstairs?
- Possibly alone.
- Okay.
All right, so...
What the hell?
You lied about your college interview, and I don't like liars.
- I can explain.
- Explain what?
That you're pathological?
That you invent stories about interviews that never even happened?
You make it sound so bad.
Cohen, you are in a deceit spiral.
If you don't stop, you'll turn into one of those creepy men with secret attics where they hide stolen money and porn.
First of all, that sounds awesome.
Second of all, could be worse.
- I got scared.
- Scared?
Yeah.
Tongue-tied, dizzy, my bladder felt weak.
I just wanna know why you didn't tell me.
Because I was embarrassed.
You've got this natural confidence.
You're small and you're cute.
People like you.
I'm a social outcast with a mumbling problem.
- You're just realizing this now?
- lf we go to college together everybody's gonna love you, and I'm gonna be your nerdy boyfriend.
I'm gonna be your not-so-bright girlfriend that can't keep up when everyone's talking about yakuza films and Proust.
- It's Proust.
- See?
Look, we have to be honest with each other, or this is never gonna work.
- No, you're right.
- Anything else you need to tell me?
Because now's your chance.
Just put it out on the table.
No.
Okay.
Then you are officially exonerated.
Thesaurus again.
You wanna get down?
Hey, I didn't know we were working this weekend.
Thought maybe you and I'd go hit the links.
And ruin a sport I love?
It's the weekend, so I'm gonna make this brief.
I was at dinner last night with Kirsten at the yacht club.
I saw you there.
With Maya.
Griffin told Maya about meeting me, so she decided to get in touch.
- She asked you to dinner?
- She did.
Why, is it illegal to take a girl out to dinner?
You know, when Kirsten used to run this place I saw a lot of creeps in nice suits that tried to use her to get to her father.
I didn't like it then, and I don't like it now.
We're trying to build a hospital that could service 100,000 uninsured.
You're trying to use a daughter to manipulate her father.
And you're comfortable with that.
Sandy, you're a great guy, but maybe you don't have the stomach for this.
We have to bend the rules if we wanna win the game.
That'd look great on a bumper sticker.
I wanna see you on Monday with a real game plan.
All right.
Hey.
- Kirsten let me in.
She seems really nice.
- What do you want?
Look, you've always been a really good guy to me.
You know, you've helped me with Volchok.
- Trusted me with Marissa...
- Now you're in love with her.
I told her.
I promised myself I would just live with these feelings, you know.
I wouldn't do anything about them.
But I just can't do that anymore.
What do you want, my blessing?
I guess, I just...
Just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Thanks for that.
Leave.
Now.
I'm passionately devoted to my work on the board of the Children's Museum.
Children are so important, don't you think?
She's so phony.
Well, of course she is.
She lives in Newport.
Oh, God, mayday.
Taryn Baker just walked in.
Get out of there before she sees you.
Oh, too late.
Hi, Taryn.
Why are you all bundled up like that?
Has Newport been taken over by the Taliban?
I'd love to stay and chat, but I have to be going.
Oh, my goodness, it's Laura Cross.
Laura.
Hi.
- It's me, Taryn, from Orchid Club.
- Oh, Taryn, of course.
- Do you know Julie?
- I have to go.
- We haven't met.
Julie?
- Julie?
Oh, my.
What a coincidence.
Have you been sitting at the next table this whole time?
Are you spying on me?
I...
I'm sorry.
Hey.
There's a sale at Paul Frank if you wanna go.
Probably can't afford anything.
- But we could try stuff on.
- No, thanks.
I'm guessing you're still mad at me.
I know you may not believe this, but I'm trying to do you a favor.
Oh, yeah?
Well, thanks.
So far it's been a real blast.
Remember when we were little, and Dad used to take us to Baskin-Robbins?
You'd have to sample every flavor before you could decide what you wanted.
And then once you did, you'd realize you didn't like it, so you'd cry.
Dad would take you back to get another.
Another story about how growing up, it was always about me?
No.
It's about you not trusting your instincts.
- Maybe I'm not built that way.
- So?
It's a skill.
Learn it.
Make a decision and stick with it.
- Remember what I used to always get?
- Gold Medal Ribbon.
Every time.
I figured, I loved it, why question it?
Honey, you just missed Marissa.
- Marissa?
- Yeah.
She left this for you.
I'm sorry.
You wanna be with Johnny.
No.
I'm sorry I ever made you wonder.
You two have a connection.
I get that.
It's not about him.
No, it's about me.
It was just not being able to talk to you about Trey.
And then with Kaitlin coming back, her hooking up with Johnny it threw me for a loop.
- I think we can get past that.
- It's not that easy.
You can't just snap your fingers and make everything the way it was.
Well, we can try.
Maybe start with dinner?
Oh, no.
This is KRKR TV.
And now for the latest news.
Early tonight, the captain of a Swedish icebreaker in the Barents Sea reported seeing a strange red fireball come out of the sky.
Says the captain, "It hovered above my ship for about a minute"...
Johnny.
Which Coop are you here to see?
I'm here to see you.
I thought maybe we could go to the beach.
For a night surfing lesson?
I was thinking more like bonfire and tequila.
Even better.
I know where my mom keeps the stash.
So, what's the occasion?
Just feel like you and I never got a chance to party.
- What do you say?
- Okay.
- Hungry?
- Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
- I should have called.
- Oh, that's okay.
I figured you were here.
Who would've thought the Newport Group would be where I go for a moment of Zen?
Sometimes this job makes you do a lot of hard thinking.
I want this hospital more than I've wanted anything in a long time.
Then you can't let Matt's relationship with Maya Griffin stand in your way.
She could be using him too.
Or they could live happily ever after.
The point is, if you want this as bad as I think you do you have to go for it.
So where's the line?
I'm not worried about you knowing where the line is.
You always do.
It's who you are.
Coming.
- Cohen?
- Hang on.
Cohen, why is the door locked?
Cohen.
I brought some DVDs.
Save the Last Dance and She's All That.
I know you're not interested but I can't watch another movie with Japanese people flying.
That's fine.
Let's go downstairs.
- That's fine?
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I'm great.
Come on.
- What's that smell?
- It is incense.
- I was doing yoga, plus I had bad gas.
- Gross.
Wish we brought something to mix it with.
Couple more sips, you won't even notice.
Okay, alky.
Can we just hook up already?
Before you pass out on me.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Well, it's just the fire, it's so romantic.
And the fire is actually kind of dying.
Well, okay then.
I'll just go find some driftwood.
Heat things up a bit.
What's that?
Nothing I wanna remember.
Where you going?
- Climb up there.
- Okay.
Tequila and rock climbing.
I'm not exactly sure that's the best combination.
So don't come.
Johnny, wait.
Go away, Gus.
I told you, I don't wanna play strip pinochle.
You play strip pinochle?
Long story.
What...?
What are you doing here?
I stopped by to thank you for fixing me up with Laura.
She's a wonderful woman.
Well, good.
I'm glad it worked out with the two of you.
If you'll excuse me, I have a Hot Pocket in the microwave and a wine cooler with my name on it, so good luck.
What?
What do you want?
You.
Excuse me?
You can be manipulative.
You can be aggressive.
I've known you to stretch the truth on occasion.
But the fact is when I'm not around you, I miss you.
You do?
What can I say?
I've fallen for you.
Well, this just may be your lucky night.
I have an extra Hot Pocket.
I'm almost to the top.
Johnny, would you just come down already?
- You're wasted.
- I'm not wasted.
Johnny, just come down.
- Stop it, that's high enough.
- I'm not gonna fall.
You're scaring me.
I get it.
You're awesome.
Just stop.
- Johnny!
Oh, my God.
- It's okay!
Johnny!
- You see?
- Johnny, just come down.
I almost dropped it.
It's okay, I got it.
Johnny, please, just come down!
Seth is really into that movie.
Yeah, I know.
And he ate all of our dumplings.
I know it's gonna take more than Thai food and teen movies to sort this out but if you wanna talk...
Talking's the last thing I feel like doing.
I figured, since you gave me the silent treatment the whole way in the car.
What do you want from me?
I want you.
- You wanna answer that?
- Not really.
- It's Kaitlin.
- She's setting the mood.
All right.
Let me just get rid of her.
Setting the mood.
I'm telling you.
Wait.
Kaitlin, let me call you back.
Can you come and get me?
- I'm at Westwood Cove with Johnny.
- No, I'm busy.
Yeah, you're getting busy.
No, but you don't understand.
I'm scared.
He's drunk and acting like a crazy person.
Come up here!
You gotta see this view!
- Johnny, just come down!
- What's that?
Marissa, it's him.
I'm telling you.
Johnny's in trouble, and I don 't know what to do.
Hold on.
She sounds really upset.
- It's Johnny?
- Yeah, he's in trouble.
- Kaitlin?
- Ryan, you have to help me.
- He's drunk and he's gonna get hurt.
- He's really in trouble?
- Yes, come now.
- Be right there.
So that was...?
That was Save the Last Dance, huh?
Okay, I know there weren't any subtitles or kung fu or whatever.
- But I thought it was good.
- I thought it was amazing.
That dance number at the end was so inspiring.
And, Summer, I'm so glad I'm so, so glad that she got into Juilliard in the end.
And she did it for her mom.
For her mom, Summer.
Yeah, it wasn't that good.
This is pretty amazing too.
- It's just a blue screen, Cohen.
- I know, but it's so blue.
I never realized how blue it was before.
I kind of like...
I wanna go swimming in it or something.
- Yeah.
- For a little dippy-dip.
- Okay.
It's pretty blue.
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
We should...
We should take our pants off.
Come on, Captain Oats.
We both know something's up.
Over there.
You go to Kaitlin.
I'll find another way up there.
- Keep him talking.
- Okay.
Be careful.
- Johnny, just come down!
- Kaitlin.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm so happy that you're here.
Marissa.
Johnny, look, you have to get down from there.
Go home.
I don't have anything to say to you.
We can get through this.
You're one of my best friends.
After all we've been through, I get to be your best friend.
Go away!
Leave me alone!
Come on, just let me explain it to you.
Just come down, Johnny.
Dude, you are the last person I wanna see now.
Let's get you down from there.
We can talk about it later, okay?
Right, right.
Right, so you can save me one more time in front of Marissa.
Hey, Marissa!
Marissa!
You wanna watch Ryan save me again?
- Just come down, Johnny, please?
- So she'll love you even more.
- Get back from the edge.
- Listen to her!
- Just be careful.
- Or what, I might fall?
You get to come in and grab me at the last second?
Ryan Atwood saves the...
Subtitles by SDI Media Group
Previously, on The O.C.--
Do you think that Marissa would mind if I invited Johnny?
She seemed a little weird when she saw us together last night.
But they're just friends, so why would it matter?
I love Ryan.
It doesn't mean that you don't like Johnny.
I don't.
Then you wouldn't mind that I just made out with him upstairs.
We both have very complex lives, and... maybe we should consider all of the implications before going further.
Are we building a hospital?
Is it too late for a new approach?
Let's do it your way.
You're trying to take care of me.
The least I can do is take care of you.
Caleb would've been proud.
We got it.
Sandy, that's wonderful.
And you did it your way.
Yeah.
Cohen!
I got one!
Got an interview with the Brown guy.
Mrs. Rothschild just told me, and that you got one, too.
Please tell me it went okay.
It went great.
We totally bonded.
Are you high?
Am I high?
Ryan.
Ryan.
Come on, wake up.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Seth is gone.
What?
He's gone?
Yeah.
His alarm went off, I went into his room, his bed his empty.
Uh... calc exam.
Calc exam?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, he probably just went in early to school to cram for it.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna drive over there to make sure.
No, no.
I'll go.
I'll go.
I got to get to school early anyway.
If there was anything going on with, Seth, anything I should know, you would tell me, right?
Yeah.
I'll call you, uh, when I find him.
Hey, man.
So, uh, Sandy noticed you're gone-- he's worried.
Just taking in the sunrise, Ryan.
Yeah, that's what they have windows for.
So I wanted to be alone-- are you the only one in this family that's allowed to brood?
Man, whatever it is, you can tell me.
My Brown interview did not go... so well.
Actually, it didn't go at all.
You blew it off?
Yep.
And then to put the cherry on top of that, I went ahead and lied to Summer about it.
Right.
Well...
I don't know, talk to her.
Yeah, see, Summer was over pot by the tenth grade.
She thinks it's totally juvenile-- it'd be like telling her I'm into Beanie Babies.
Well, you know, at least tell her that you missed the interview.
You do that, and I'll keep quiet about the rest of it.
We're getting dangerously close to an after-school special here, Ryan.
It's marijuana, and I did it twice.
So you're telling me you didn't come down here to buy a bag?
Fine, I wasn't gonna smoke anymore anyways.
What are you doing?
Trying to decide on a bathing suit.
Do you think tankinis are over?
You're going swimming?
No.
Johnny's taking me for a surf lesson.
He says the waves are always best in the morning.
That's what I hear.
Look...
I know that you're mad about me and Johnny.
I'm not mad.
Do I look mad?
Okay, we may not be BFFs, but you're my sister, and I can tell when you're mad.
Kaitlin, look in my eyes.
I don't care about you and Johnny.
You have a boyfriend.
So Johnny Harbor's fair game, right?
I'm not talking about this.
Can you honestly tell me you have no feelings for him?
That's what I thought.
Hey.
You're right on time.
Sorry, I didn't mean to walk in on anything.
No problem.
You ready to surf?
Uh, I got to go.
Enjoy the beach.
Katy Rubell, 39, single.
Loves tennis, loves working out.
Do we have anyone for her?
I say she dies alone.
Julie!
I'm sorry, I just can't focus on fixing other people's love lives when my own is such a mess.
Dr. Roberts will call you.
Or if you want, you could call him.
I know you've been married for, like, 200 years, but you must remember something about dating.
Well, I hope so, or I'm in the wrong business.
Maybe that's the answer.
Pitch Dr. Roberts the dating service, set him up.
Set him up?
Are you high?
No, I'm serious.
Then you'll be back on his radar and it won't seem like you're pursuing him.
I like it.
I'm aloof but thoughtful.
And when he's confronted with the idea of dating these Newpsies...
Half of whom he's Botox'd himself.
...he will realize that the only woman he wants is you.
And he will call you for dinner.
I'll suggest Al Fiorno's, a table by the window.
I'm impressed.
You're sneakier than I thought, Kirsten Cohen.
Well, being around you all these years, it's rubbed off.
Hey.
Hey, Cohen.
Hey, did you write your thank you note yet to the Brown interviewer?
No.
Actually, that's something I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, you came to the right person, because I am master of the thank you note.
Listen to this.
"Thank you so much for the resplendent interview."
"Resplendent."
Yeah.
I bought a thesaurus.
Shelly loves SAT words.
Hey, I didn't know you two were on a first-name basis.
Oh, yeah, we totally power-bonded.
Which means I may actually have a chance of getting into Brown.
Do you know what that means?
No calling, no texting, no e-mailing-- just us together, isn't that great?
Yeah.
Okay, so tell me-- how did your interview really go?
Do you think you aced it?
I knocked it out of the park.
- Really?
!
- Yeah.
Yeah.
And it wasn't easy, believe me, but, you know, I turned on the Cohen charm, as usual, and... the lady swooned.
- Cohen?
- Yeah?
Shelly's a guy.
Is it because... yes, yes, you're...
I'm sor... correct.
But with the feminine energy, I don't know, I got a gay vibe,
I'm gender-blind, that's the thing, and that's something that I'm gonna have to work on at Brown next year when we go together, when we go together.
Okay, I'm gonna see you later.
I got to go.
- Cohen.
- We'll talk after school.
Wow, somebody was really craving caffeine.
Oh, yeah.
I can barely keep my eyes open.
Early morning wake-up call, courtesy of Seth.
Oh, has he told Summer yet?
No, and he's not going to.
By the way, I promised that, um, we'd keep quiet about it, as long as he told her about the interview.
Oh, I was looking forward to Summer bitch-slapping Kaitlin for giving Seth pot.
Guess she's just gonna get away with it, like always.
You know, it's for the best.
I mean, she screwed up, but she's still pretty much a kid.
Yeah.
But with my mom's DNA.
Which means she's capable of more than you think.
Um... are we still talking about Seth, or...
This is just sister stuff.
You know, I should probably get to class.
See you later.
Okay.
It's "just sister stuff"?
Okay, let's practice your pop-up one more time.
When you told me you were gonna give me a surfing lesson,
I kind of imagined us in the water.
No, no.
First lesson's always on the sand.
As long as we're skipping the water part, why don't we just do this back at your place?
Or we could just blow the whole thing off.
Rent a movie, order in pancakes.
I thought you said you wanted to learn how to surf.
I'm not training for the Olympics, okay?
Sorry.
I'm just distracted.
Thinking about Marissa.
Story of my life.
I like a guy, he's in love with my older sister...
Look, Marissa and I have a history together, all right?
It's... just complicated.
Uncomplicate it.
Do something.
I can't do anything.
It's not my place.
If you're too lame to do something, I'll just find somebody who will.
I thought this was a done deal.
Miriam already gave us the hospital contract.
He did.
And now he has to present it to the Board of Physicians.
Can't have a hospital without doctors.
Like or not, they got a say.
Right.
Now we have to ply more people with women and liquor.
I don't think that's gonna work.
These guys are doctors, not businessmen.
Then we got that in common.
Call it willful naiveté, call it bleary-eyed optimism.
You think we've got a shot.
Yeah.
There's over 100,000 uninsured that live in Orange County.
There's got to be some angle we can find to make that land on these guys.
Well, there is.
The head of the board, Henry Griffin.
Turns out we have a... a personal connection.
Well, now, there's a shocking turn of events.
It's his daughter, Maya.
She's a stripper, too?
No, she was a year ahead of me at Kellogg.
Now she's one of its most trusted advisors.
And she used to have a thing for me.
Well, who could blame her?
So now you want to wine and dine her, use her affection for you to manipulate her father.
Listen, it's no worse than the strippers we got for Bill Miriam.
Oh, I don't know.
I draw the line at family, Matt.
How about this?
How about we find a strategy that doesn't involve liquor or sexual favors?
Thank you.
I mean, gracias.
Julie?
Hi.
Uh, your receptionist told me you'd be home today, so I thought I'd come by and personally thank you for hosting Kaitlin's birthday party.
And as a token of my appreciation...
Bachelorettes of Newport?
You want to set me up?
Well, unless... you don't want to be set up.
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.
Because I can totally understand if a blind date seems like too much.
Let's see what you have there.
New match.
Wow, she's pretty.
Mmm, pear shaped.
But pretty.
Ooh.
Look at her, nice... smile.
Yeah.
Adult braces.
And her...
Julie, all of these women look fantastic.
It's going to take me a while to choose one.
Do you mind if I get back to you?
Finally, you're home.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were waiting for me.
Well, I just get kind of lonely while you guys are all at school.
Speaking of school, shouldn't you be going back to yours soon?
How many times do I have to tell you guys?
It's called mid-winter break.
It's long.
Apparently.
Look, I want to talk to you about Marissa.
This whole Johnny triangle we're all trapped in.
Triangle?
Well, now that I'm here, it's more like a square.
Well, anyway, see, I like him.
And I'm not getting anywhere because he thinks he's got a chance with Marissa.
Well, not that that's any of your business, but it's not the case.
I don't know.
See, today I asked her if she had feelings for him point blank.
She didn't deny it.
Well, thanks for the heads up.
I think Marissa and I can handle it ourselves.
So if you just want to...
Ryan, I want you to do something about it.
I mean, you're a man of action.
You throw punches at fires.
At least that's the guy I remember from two years ago.
We've all grown up since then.
So you're reformed now?
Congratulations.
Doesn't mean you still can't talk to her.
So you can hook up with Johnny?
You get something out of it, too.
You get to find out where you stand... once and for all.
Ryan, hey.
Is everything okay?
'Cause you sounded really weird on the phone.
I need to know how you feel about Johnny.
So I take it Kaitlin paid you a visit.
This isn't about Kaitlin.
We both knew this was an issue long before she showed up.
I'm with you.
But that's not the whole story, is it?
Maybe you just feel sorry for him or... maybe sometimes you didn't think you can talk to me... or I wasn't listening... or maybe you're in love with him.
Either way, you got to figure it out.
Until then, I...
I don't want to see you.
Look, I know things have been confusing...
Hey.
Morning.
Oh, no, the Atwood grunt.
That's never a good sign.
What's the matter?
I'm going to guess.
Marissa.
Or Johnny.
Maybe Kaitlin.
I'm going to say probably a combo platter.
I think Marissa and I are on thin ice.
She needs to figure out her relationship with Johnny pronto.
She's, uh, got good taste in people.
I'm sure she'll do the right thing.
Speaking of the right thing...
Um...
I tried to talk to Summer.
And?
I chickened out.
Which is kind of my go-to move these days.
But I'm going to take care of it.
And I'm rescheduling the interview.
Think they're going to let you take it again after you blew the first one off?
Well, for the first one I had an epileptic fit.
And there was a three-car pileup on the freeway with a jackknifed trailer truck, so...
- All right, I'll work on my excuse.
- That's a good idea.
Oh, Kaitlin, you're up.
I was just making some grits.
Okay.
Mom, we get it.
We live in a trailer park.
There's no need to go overboard.
Marissa, you want some?
I'm not hungry.
Fine.
I'll go see if Gus likes these.
I mean, he does eat pigeons after all.
Be right back.
I'd kill for some Apple Jacks.
Do you think we have any?
Kaitlin, you had no right to talk to Ryan about my relationship with Johnny.
It's none of your business.
I was just sharing my opinion.
What did I ever do to you?
I mean, I know Mom ignores you and Dad left.
Okay, let's not turn this into family therapy.
Okay, then let's not pretend this is all about Johnny.
What else would this be about?
Come on, you're doing this to punish me.
You know, I was actually happy when you came home.
I thought we were gonna be friends again.
But now I just can't wait for you to leave.
Summer...
I just got off the phone with Mr. Spivey from Brown.
Looks like you've got a fan.
Oh, great.
You know, I was actually just curious.
Did he mention how I went with Seth?
Seth Cohen?
Yeah.
You know, gangly, mop-head, barely has an ass.
Right.
Um... unfortunately, Seth missed his interview.
- What?
- He was a no-show.
He was just in here explaining the situation.
Something about a tractor-trailer accident.
Oh, my God, that little bitch.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
Thank you for your help.
Well...
I finally heard from Dr. Roberts.
That's great.
Or not.
He had me set him up with Laura Cross.
They'll be eating at Al Fiorno's, a table by the window.
Oh, Julie, I'm sorry.
Oh, no, it's my own fault.
I let you do the scheming, clearly not your wheel house.
From now on, if someone needs to be manipulated, we put me in charge.
Fair enough.
Laura Cross...
I don't know her.
Well, she'll probably marry him and enjoy a life of free brow lifts.
Anyway...
I am going to get to know her and find out what I'm up against.
Don't tell me you're going to spy on them.
I tried taking your advice, Kiki, and quite frankly, it sucked.
From now on, we do things the Julie Cooper way.
Julie Cooper, be careful.
I see we have a problem.
Chili, man, I'm fine, all right, I just...
In love with Marissa Cooper.
My friend, in all my years of loving ladies and getting nothing in return
I have never been as bad off as you.
Thanks, man.
Makes me feel a lot better.
Normally...
I would advise you to go cold turkey.
Delete her number from your cell, spam-block her e-mails, and just hope that the obsession passes.
But I see that you are in deeper than this.
So what do I do?
You take a shot.
That way, even if she rejects you, at least you know you tried.
Yeah, and there's always a chance that she feels the same way, right?
Reasons abound.
The point is, you owe it to yourself to at least know whether or not she likes you.
You could have a drink tonight.
You sure?
Well, you've had a tough day.
So has Matt.
Looks like he's come here to drown his sorrows.
Oh.
Well, you should ask him to join us if he's all by himself.
Or not.
Ah, that's Maya Griffin.
O.C. Weekly just did a profile on her.
Apparently she's an up-and-coming Newpsie.
Wow, I have too much time on my hands.
Well, if she's the new queen, she's still got a lot to learn.
Well, why wouldn't she date him?
He's young and attractive.
He's using her.
Her father's the head of the board.
Are you going to talk to him?
Tomorrow.
Tonight, I'm out with my lovely, beautiful, morally uncompromised wife.
We could go to the Crab Shack, pick up something to go.
Sand dabs are in season.
Genius.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you, too.
Things have been...
Really weird between us.
I know.
Um...
That's just why I wanted to get everything out in the open.
Johnny, I don't know if now's the time to...
I love you... and I think you love me, too.
Johnny...
Look, okay, look what's happened between us.
I mean, I got hurt and you took care of me even when I begged you not to.
I know.
That's true.
But...
I told you to stay away from me and you showed up at my house.
I'm not imagining this, okay?
There's something real between us.
That's why neither of us can walk away.
Look... you don't have to say anything right now, okay?
Just, you know, think about it.
Morning.
Morning.
Hi, Ryan.
Feel like a bagel?
I do, thank you.
Ah, there's my son.
How are you?
Good.
Do we have poppy?
Oh, great.
How are you really?
Uh...
I'm really fine, Dad.
How are you?
I'm good.
I'm good.
Just making sure you're staying afloat.
I know you got a lot of stress.
Exams, college applications.
Yeah, no, not to worry.
It's all under control.
Oh, hey, Summer.
Hi.
Just in time for breakfast.
Oh, thanks, Mr. C.
Actually, I was wondering if I could talk to Seth upstairs... um, possibly alone.
Okay.
All right, so...
Ow!
What the hell?
You lied about your college interview, and I don't like liars!
I can explain.
Explain what, that you're pathological?
That you invent stories about college interviews that never even happened?
You make it sounds so bad.
Cohen, you are in a deceit spiral, and if you don't stop now, you could turn into one of those creepy old men who have secret attics where they hide stolen money and porn.
Okay, first of all, that sounds awesome.
Second of all, could be worse.
I got scared.
Scared?
Yeah.
Tongue-tied, uh, dizzy.
My bladder felt weak.
I just want to know why you didn't tell me.
Because I was embarrassed.
You've got this natural confidence.
You're small and you're cute.
People like you.
I'm a social outcast with a mumbling problem.
You're just realizing this now?
Well, if we go to college together, everybody's going to love you, and I'm going to be your nerdy boyfriend.
And I'm going to be your not-so-bright girlfriend that can't keep up when everyone's talking about Yakuza films and Prowst.
It's Proust.
See?
Look, we have to be honest with each other, or this is never going to work.
No, you're right.
So is there anything else you need to tell me?
'Cause now's your chance.
Just put it out on the table.
No.
Okay.
Then you are officially exonerated.
Thesaurus again.
You want to get down?
Hey.
I didn't know we were working this weekend.
I thought maybe you and I would go hit the links.
What, and ruin a sport I love?
It's the weekend, so I'm going to make this brief as I know how.
I was at dinner last night with Kirsten at the Yacht Club.
I saw you there... with Maya.
Henry Griffin told Maya about meeting with me, so she decided to get in touch.
She asked you to dinner.
She did.
Why?
Is it illegal to take a girl out to dinner?
You know, when Kirsten used to run this place,
I saw a lot of creeps in nice suits that used to try to use her to get to her father.
I didn't like it then, and I don't like it now.
We're trying to build a hospital that could service 100,000 uninsured.
You're trying to use a daughter to manipulate her father... and you're comfortable with that.
Look, Sandy, you're a great guy, but maybe you don't have the stomach for this.
All I'm saying is that we're going to have to bend the rules if we want to win the game.
That'd look great on a bumper sticker.
I want to see you on Monday with a real game plan.
All right.
Hey.
Um...
Kirsten let me in.
She seems really nice.
What do you want?
Look, um... you've always been a really good guy to me.
You know, you've helped me with Volchek, trusted me with Marissa...
Now you're in love with her.
I told her.
I-I promised myself I-I would just live with these feelings, you know--
I wouldn't do anything about them, but, um...
I just can't do that anymore.
What, do you want my blessing?
I guess I just... just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Thanks for that.
Leave now.
Well, I'm passionately devoted to my work on the board of the Children's Museum.
Children are so important, don't you think?
Oh, she's so phony.
Well, of course she is.
She lives in Newport.
Oh, God, mayday.
Taryn Baker just walked in.
Well, you'd better get out of there before she sees you.
Dinner with you, apparently.
Oh, too late.
Hi, Taryn.
Why are you all bundled up like that?
Has Newport been taken over by the Taliban?
I'd really love to stay and chat, but I have to be going...
Oh, my goodness, it's Laura Cross!
Laura, hi!
It's me, Taryn, from Orchid Club.
Oh, Taryn, of course.
Do you know Julie?
I have to go.
We haven't met.
Julie?
Julie?
Oh, my!
What a coincidence.
Have you been sitting at the next table this whole time?
Are you spying on me?
Uh...
I...
I'm sorry.
Hey.
There's a sale at Paul Frank if you want to go.
Probably can't afford anything, but we could try stuff on.
No thanks.
I'm guessing you're still mad at me.
Look, I know you may not believe me when I say this, but I'm trying to do you a favor.
Oh, yeah?
Well, thanks.
So far, it's been a real blast.
Remember when we were little, and Dad used to always take us to Baskin-Robbins?
You'd have to sample, like, every single flavor before you could decide on what you actually wanted, and then once you did, you realized that you didn't like it, so you'd cry.
Dad would have to take you back in to get another cone.
Is this another story about how growing up, it was always about me?
No.
It's about you not trusting your instincts.
Maybe I'm not built that way.
So?
It's a skill.
Learn it.
Make a decision and stick with it.
Remember what I used to always get?
Gold Medal Ribbon.
Every time.
I figured I loved it-- why question it?
Honey, you just missed Marissa.
Marissa?
Yeah.
She left this for you.
I'm sorry.
You want to be with Johnny.
No, I'm sorry I ever made you wonder.
Look, you two have a connection.
I get that.
It's not even about him.
No, it's... it's about me.
I was just... not being able to talk to you about Trey.
And then with Kaitlin coming back, her hooking up with Johnny, it just... it threw me for a loop.
But I think we can get past that.
It's not that easy.
You can't just snap your fingers and make everything go back the way it was before.
Well, we can try.
Maybe start with dinner?
Johnny.
Which Cooper are you here to see?
I'm here to see you.
I thought maybe we could go to the beach.
For a night surfing lesson?
I was thinking more like bonfire and tequila.
Even better.
Know where my mom keeps the stash.
So, what's the occasion?
Just feel like you and I never really got a chance to party.
What do you say?
Okay.
Hungry?
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
I...
I should've called.
Oh, it's okay.
I figured you were here.
Who would've thought the Newport Group would be where I go to for a moment of zen?
I know.
Sometimes this job makes you do a lot of hard thinking.
I want this hospital more than I've wanted anything in a long time.
Then you can't let Matt's relationship with Maya Griffin stand in your way.
For all you know, she could be using him, too, or they could live happily ever after.
The point is if you want this as bad as I think you do, you have to go for it.
So where's the line?
I'm not worried about you knowing where the line is.
You always do.
It's who you are.
Coming!
Cohen!
Hang on...
Cohen, why is the door locked?
Cohen, I brought some DVDs.
Save the Last Dance and She's All That.
Now, I know you're not interested in either of them, but I cannot watch another movie about Japanese people flying through the air.
Okay, that's fine.
Let's go downstairs.
Wait, what?
That's fine, but are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great.
Come on.
What's that smell?
It is incense.
I was doing yoga, plus I had some really bad gas.
Gross.
Oh, God, wish I'd brought something to mix it with.
Couple more sips, you won't even notice.
Okay, alkie.
Can we just hook up already?
Or, before you pass out on me.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Well, it's just the fire.
It's so romantic.
Well, the fire is, actually, kind of dying.
Well, okay then.
I'll just go find some driftwood.
Heat things up a bit.
What's that?
Nothing I want to remember.
Where are you going?
To climb up there.
Okay, tequila and rock climbing, I'm not exactly sure that's the best combination.
So don't come.
Johnny, wait.
Go away, Gus.
I told you, I don't play strip pinochle.
You play strip pinochle?
Long story.
What...
What are you doing here?
I stopped by to thank you for fixing me up with Laura.
She's a wonderful woman.
Well, good.
I'm glad it worked out with the two of you.
If you'll excuse me, I have a Hot Pocket in the microwave and a wine cooler with my name on it, so good luck.
What?
What do you want?
You.
Excuse me?
You can be manipulative, you can be aggressive,
I've know you to stretch the truth on occasion.
But the fact is, when I'm not around you, I miss you.
You do?
What can I say?
I've fallen for you.
Well... this just may be your lucky night.
I have an extra Hot Pocket.
Johnny, would you just come down already?
You're wasted.
No, I'm not wasted.
Johnny, just come down.
Stop it, that's high enought.
I'm not gonna fall.
You're scaring me.
I got it.
You're awesome.
Just stop!
Johnny!
It's okay.
Johnny!
Did you see?
Johnny, just come down.
I almost dropped it.
It's okay, I got it.
Johnny, please!
Just come down.
Seth's really into that movie.
Yeah, I know, and he ate all of our dumplings.
Look, I know it's gonna take more than Thai food and teen movies to sort this out, but if you want to talk...
Talking is the last thing I feel like doing.
I figured, since you gave me the silent treatment the whole way in the car.
What do you want from me?
I want you.
You want to answer that?
Not really.
Wait.
It's Kaitlin.
Ah, she's setting the mood.
All right, let me just get rid of her.
Setting the mood.
Tell her that...
Wait.
Kaitlin, let me call you back.
Marissa, can you come and get me?
I'm at Westward Cove with Johnny.
No, I'm busy.
You're getting busy.
No, but you don't understand.
I'm scared.
He's drunk and he's acting like a crazy person.
Hey, come up here!
You got to see this view!
Johnny, just come down.
What's that?
Marissa, it's him, I'm telling you.
Johnny's in trouble and I don't know what to do.
Um, hold on.
She sounds really upset.
It's Johnny?
Yeah, he's in trouble.
Kaitlin?
Ryan, you have to help me.
He's drunk and he's gonna get hurt.
He's really in trouble?
Yes.
Come now.
We'll be right there.
Wow.
So that was, um... that was Save the Last Dance, uh?
Okay, I know there weren't any subtitles or kung fu or whatever,
- but I thought it was pretty good.
- No, I thought it was amazing.
That dance number at the end was so inspiring.
And Summer, I'm so glad...
I'm so, so glad, that she got into Julliard in the end.
And she did it for her mom.
For her mom, Summer.
Yeah, it wasn't that good.
This is pretty amazing, too.
It's just a blue screen, Cohen.
I know, but it's so blue.
I never realized how blue it was before.
I kind of, like, want to go swimming in it or something.
Yeah.
For a little dippy-dip.
Okay, it's pretty blue.
Yeah.
Could you excuse me, I got to go to the bathroom.
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
We should, we should take our pants off.
Come on, Captain Oats.
We both know something's up.
Ew.
Over there.
You go to Kaitlin.
I'm gonna find another way up there.
- Keep him talking.
- Okay.
Be careful.
Johnny, just come down!
Kaitlin.
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm so happy that you're here.
Marissa!
Johnny...
look, you have to get down from there.
Go home!
I don't have anything to say to you.
Look, we can get through this, all right?
I mean, you're one of my best friends.
After all we've been through, I get to be your best friend?
Go away.
Leave me alone.
Come on, let me explain it to you.
Look, just come down, Johnny.
Dude, you are the last person I want to see right now.
Okay, all right, let's get you down from there.
We can talk about it later, okay?
Right, right.
So you can save me one more time for Marissa.
Hey, Marissa!
Marissa!
You want to watch Ryan save me again?
!
Just come down, Johnny, please!
So she'll love you even more.
Okay, just be careful, all right?
What, I might fall, you get to come in and grab me at the last second?
Ryan Atwood saves the...
Previously on The O.C.:
Do you think that Marissa would mind if I invited Johnny?
She seemed a little weird when she saw us together last night.
But they're just friends, so why would it matter?
I love Ryan.
-lt doesn't mean you don't like Johnny.
-l don't.
Then you wouldn't mind that I just made out with him upstairs.
We both have very complex lives...
... andmaybewe shouldconsider all the implications before going further.
Are we building a hospital?
-ls it too late for a new approach?
-Let's do it your way.
You're trying to take care of me.
The least I can do is take care of you.
-Caleb would've been proud.
-We got it.
Sandy, that's wonderful.
And you did it your way.
Yeah.
Cohen!
I got one.
An interview with the Brown guy.
Rushfield told me, and you got one too.
Please tell me it went okay.
It went great.
We totally bonded.
Are you high?
Am I high?
Ryan.
Ryan.
Come on, wake up.
-Hi.
What's wrong?
-Seth is gone.
-What?
He's gone?
-Yeah.
His alarm went off, I went into his room, his bed is empty.
-Calc exam.
-Calc exam?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He probably just went in early to school, cram for it.
-l'm gonna drive there to make sure.
-No, no, I'll go. I'll go.
I gotta get to school early anyway.
If there was anything going on with Seth, anything I should know...
... youwouldtellme, right?
Yeah. I'll call you when I find him.
Hey, man.
So Sandy noticed you're gone.
He's worried.
-Just taking in the sunrise, Ryan.
-That's what they got windows for.
So I wanted to be alone.
Are you the only one that's allowed to brood?
Man, whatever it is, you can tell me.
My Brown interview did not go so well.
Actually, it didn't go at all.
-You blew it off?
-Yep.
Then to put the cherry on top, I went ahead and lied to Summer about it.
Right.
Well, I don't know, talk to her.
Yeah, it's just, Summer was over pot by the 1 0th grade.
She thinks it's juvenile. lt's like telling her I'm into Beanie Babies.
At least tell her you missed the interview.
You do that, and I'll keep quiet about the rest.
We're getting dangerously close to an after-school special.
It's marijuana, I did it twice.
So you're telling me you didn't come down here to buy a bag?
Fine, I wasn't gonna smoke anymore anyways.
-What are you doing?
-Trying to decide on a bathing suit.
-Do you think tankinis are over?
-You're going swimming?
No.
Johnny's taking me for a surf lesson.
Says the waves are best in the morning.
That's what I hear.
Look, I know that you're mad about me and Johnny.
I'm not mad.
Do I look mad?
Okay, we may not be BFFs...
... butyou'remy sister, and I can tell when you're mad.
Kaitlin, look in my eyes.
I don't care about you and Johnny.
You have a boyfriend.
So Johnny Harper's fair game, right?
I'm not talking about this.
Can you honestly tell me you have no feelings for him?
That's what I thought.
Hey.
You're right on time.
Sorry, I didn't mean to walk in on anything.
-No problem.
You ready to surf?
-l gotta go.
Enjoy the beach.
Katie Rubel, 39, single.
Loves tennis, loves working out.
-Do we have anyone for her?
-l say she dies alone.
-Julie.
-l'm sorry.
I just can't focus on fixing other people's love lives when my own is such a mess.
Dr. Roberts will call you.
Or if you want, you could call him.
I know you've been married for 200 years...
... butyoumustremember something about dating.
Well, I hope so, or I'm in the wrong business.
Maybe that's the answer.
Pitch Dr. Roberts the dating service, set him up.
-Set him up?
Are you high?
-No, I'm serious.
Then you'll be back on his radar, and it won't seem like you're pursuing him.
I like it. I'm aloof, but thoughtful.
When he confronts the idea of dating these Newpsies--
Half of whom he's botoxed himself.
--he will realize that the only woman he wants is you.
-And he will call you for dinner.
-l'll suggest Al Forno's.
A table by the window.
I'm impressed.
You're sneakier than I thought, Kirsten Cohen.
Well, being around you all these years, it's rubbed off.
-Hey.
-Hey, Cohen.
Hey, did you write your thank-you note yet to the Brown interviewer?
No, actually, that's something I wanted to talk to you about.
You came to the right person, because I am master of the thank-you note.
Listen to this.
"Thank you so much for the resplendent interview. "
-Resplendent?
-Yeah. I bought a thesaurus.
Shelley loves SAT words.
I didn't know you two were on a first-name basis.
Oh, yeah, we totally power-bonded.
Which means I may have a chance of getting into Brown.
You know what that means?
No calling, texting, e-mailing.
-Just us together. lsn't that great?
-Yeah.
So tell me, how did your interview really go?
Do you think you aced it?
-l knocked it out of the park.
-Really?
Yeah, yeah, and it wasn't easy, believe me.
But, you know, I turned on the Cohen charm, as usual...
... andtheladyswooned.
-Cohen.
-Yeah.
Shelley's a guy.
is it because--?
Yes, yes.
You're-- l'm sorry.
Correct.
But with a feminine energy.
I got a gay vibe.
I'm gender-blind, that's the thing.
That's something that I'm gonna have to work on...
... atBrown,nextyear, when we go together.
When we go together.
-l'm gonna see you later. I gotta go.
-Cohen.
We'll talk after school.
Wow, somebody was really craving caffeine.
Yeah. I can barely keep my eyes open.
Early-morning wake-up call, courtesy of Seth.
-Oh, has he told Summer yet?
-No, and he's not going to.
By the way, I promised that we'd keep quiet about it...
... aslongas he toldher about the interview.
I was looking forward to Summer bitch-slapping Kaitlin for giving Seth pot.
-Gonna get away with it, like always.
-Maybe that's best.
I mean, she screwed up, but she's still pretty much a kid.
Yeah, but with my mom's DNA.
Which means she's capable of more than you think.
-Are we still talking about Seth?
-This is just sister stuff.
You know, I should probably get to class.
See you later.
Okay.
It's just sister stuff?
Okay, let's practice your pop-up one more time.
When you told me you were gonna give me a surfing lesson...
... Ikindof imaginedusinthewater.
No, no.
First lesson's always on the sand.
As long as we're skipping the water part, let's do this back at your place.
Or we could just blow the whole thing off.
Rent a movie, order in pancakes.
You said you wanted to learn how to surf.
I'm not training for the Olympics, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm just distracted.
Thinking about Marissa.
Story of my life.
I like a guy, he's in love with my older sister.
Look, Marissa and I have a history together, all right?
-lt's just complicated.
-Uncomplicate it.
-Do something.
-l can't do anything. lt's not my place.
If you're too lame to do something, I'll just find somebody who will.
I thought this was a done deal.
Merriam gave us the contract.
He did.
Now he has to present it to the board of physicians.
Can't have a hospital without doctors.
Like it or not, they got a say.
Oh, great.
Now we have to ply more people with women and liquor.
I don't think that's gonna work.
They're doctors, not businessmen.
Then we got that in common.
Call it willful naivete, call it bleary-eyed optimism.
-You think we've got a shot?
-Yeah.
There's over 1 00,000 uninsured that live in Orange County.
There's got to be some angle we can find to make that land on these guys.
Well, there is.
The head of the board, Henry Griffin... .
Turns out we have a personal connection.
Well, now, there's a shocking turn of events.
-lt's his daughter, Maya.
-She's a stripper too?
No, she was a year ahead of me at Kellogg.
Now she's his most trusted adviser.
She used to have a thing for me.
Well, who could blame her?
So now you wanna wine and dine her.
Use her affection for you to manipulate her father.
Listen, it's no worse than the strippers we got for Bill Merriam.
Oh, I don't know.
I draw the line at family, Matt.
How about this?
How about we find a strategy that doesn't involve liquor or sexual favors?
Thank you. I mean, gracias.
-Julie.
-Hi.
Your receptionist told me you'd be home today...
... soI thoughtI'dcomeby and personally thank you...
... forhostingKaitlin'sbirthdayparty.
And as a token of my appreciation:
"Bachelorettes of Newport"?
-You wanna set me up?
-Well, unless you don't wanna be set up.
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.
Because I can totally understand if a blind date seems like too much.
Let's see what you have there.
-NewMatch.
Wow, she's pretty.
-Pear-shaped, but pretty.
-Look at her.
Nice smile.
-Yeah.
Adult braces.
And her.
Julie, all of these women look fantastic.
It's gonna take me a while to choose one.
Mind if I get back to you?
Finally.
You're home.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were waiting for me.
Well, I just get kind of lonely while you guys are all at school.
Speaking of school, shouldn't you be going back to yours soon?
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's called mid-winter break. lt's long.
-Apparently.
-Look, I wanna talk to you about Marissa.
This whole Johnny triangle we're all trapped in.
Triangle?
Now that I'm here, it's more like a square.
Well, anyway, see, I like him.
And I'm not getting anywhere because he thinks he's got a chance with Marissa.
Well, not that that's any of your business, but it's not the case.
I don't know.
See, today I asked her if she had feelings for him, point-blank.
She didn't deny it.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Marissa and I can handle it ourselves.
So if you just wanna... .
Ryan, I want you to do something about it.
I mean, you're a man of action.
You throw punches, set fires.
That's the guy I remember from two years ago.
-We've all grown up since then.
-You're reformed now.
Congratulations.
-Doesn't mean you still can't talk to her.
-So you can hook up with Johnny?
You get something out of it too.
You get to find out where you stand.
Once and for all.
Ryan, hey. is everything okay?
You sounded really weird on the phone.
I need to know how you feel about Johnny.
-So I take it Kaitlin paid you a visit.
-This isn't about Kaitlin.
We both knew this was an issue long before she showed up.
-l'm with you.
-But that's not the whole story, is it?
Look, maybe you just feel sorry for him.
Or maybe sometimes you didn't think you could talk to me...
... orI wasn'tlistening.
Or maybe you're in love with him.
Either way, you gotta figure it out.
Until then, I don't wanna see you.
Look, I know things have been confusing... .
Hey.
Morning.
Oh, no, the Atwood grunt.
That's never a good sign.
What's the matter?
Let me guess, Marissa or Johnny.
Maybe Kaitlin. I'm gonna say probably a combo platter.
-l think Marissa and I are on thin ice.
-No.
She needs to figure out her relationship with Johnny, pronto.
She's got good taste in people.
I'm sure she'll do the right thing.
Speaking of the right thing... .
-l tried to talk to Summer.
-And?
I chickened out.
Which is kind of my go-to move these days.
But I'm gonna take care of it, I'm rescheduling the interview.
Think they'll let you after you blew the first one off?
Well, for the first one, I had an epileptic fit.
There was a three-car pileup on the freeway with a jackknifed truck, so... .
-All right, I'll work on my excuse.
-That's a good idea.
And, Rita, when did you first find out that he was cheating on you?
-You mean, the first time?
-Oh, Kaitlin, you're up.
I was just making some grits.
Okay, Mom, we get it.
We live in a trailer park.
-There's no need to go overboard.
-Marissa, you want some?
-l'm not hungry.
-Fine.
I'll go see if Gus likes these.
I mean, he does eat pigeons after all.
Be right back.
I'd kill for some Apple Jacks.
Do you think we have any?
Kaitlin, you had no right to talk to Ryan about my relationship with Johnny.
-lt's none of your business.
-l was sharing my opinion.
What did I ever do to you?
I mean, I know Mom ignores you and Dad left--
-Let's not turn this into family therapy.
-Let's not pretend it's all about Johnny.
-What else would this be about?
-You're doing this to punish me.
You know, I was happy when you came home.
I thought we were gonna be friends.
But now I just can't wait for you to leave.
Summer. I just got off the phone with Mr. Spivey from Brown.
-Looks like you've got a fan.
-Oh, great.
I was just curious, did he mention how it went with Seth?
Seth Cohen?
Yeah.
Gangly, mop head, barely has an ass.
Right.
Unfortunately, Seth missed his interview.
-What?
-He was a no-show.
He was just here explaining the situation.
Something about a tractor-trailer accident.
-Oh, my God, that little bitch.
-Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
Thank you for your help.
-Well, I finally heard from Dr. Roberts.
-That's great.
-Or not.
-He had me set him up with Laura Cross.
They'll be eating at Al Forno's.
Table by the window.
-Oh, Julie, I'm sorry.
-Oh, no, it's my own fault.
I let you do the scheming.
Clearly, not your wheelhouse.
From now on, if someone needs to be manipulated...
-... weputme in charge.
-Fair enough.
Laura Cross, I don't know her.
Well, she'll probably marry him and enjoy a life of free browlifts.
Anyway, I am going to get to know her and find out what I'm up against.
Don't tell me you're gonna spy on them.
I tried taking your advice, Kiki, and quite frankly, it sucked.
From now on, we do things the Julie Cooper way.
Julie Cooper, be careful.
-l see we have a problem.
-Chili, man, I'm fine, all right?
-l'm just-- -ln love with Marissa Cooper.
In all my years of loving ladies and getting nothing in return...
... Ihaveneverbeenasbadoffasyou.
Thanks. lt makes me feel a lot better.
Normally, I would advise you to go cold turkey.
Delete her number from your cell, spam-block her e-mails...
... andhopetheobsessionpasses,but I see that you are in deeper than this.
-So, what do I do?
-Take a shot.
That way, even if she rejects you, at least you know you tried.
Yeah, and there's always the chance that she feels the same way, right?
Reasons abound.
The point is, you owe it to yourself to at least know whether or not she likes you.
-You could have a drink tonight.
-You sure?
Well, you've had a tough day.
So has Matt.
Looks like he's come here to drown his sorrows.
Oh, well, you should ask him to join us if he's all by himself.
Or not.
Oh, that's Maya Griffin.
OC Weekly did a profile on her.
Apparently, she's an up-and-coming Newpsie.
Wow, I have too much time on my hands.
If she's the new queen, she's got a lot to learn.
Well, why wouldn't she date him?
He's young and attractive.
He's using her.
Her father's the head of the board.
Are you gonna talk to him?
Tomorrow.
Tonight, I'm out with my lovely, beautiful, morally uncompromised wife.
We could go to the Crab Shack.
Pick up something to go?
Sand dabs are in season.
Genius.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you too.
-Things have been really--
-Really weird between us. I know.
That's why I wanted to get everything out.
Johnny, I don't know if now's the time-- l love you.
And I think you love me too.
-Johnny.
-Look what's happened between us.
I mean, I got hurt, and you took care of me, even when I begged you not to.
I know.
That's true, but-- l told you to stay away from me, and you showed up at my house.
I'm not imagining this, okay?
There's something real between us.
That's why neither of us can walk away.
Look, you don't have to say anything right now, okay?
Just, you know, think about it.
-Morning.
-Morning.
-Hi, Ryan.
Feel like a bagel?
-l do.
Thank you.
-There's my son.
How are you?
-Good.
Do we have poppy?
Oh, great.
-How are you, really?
-l'm really fine, Dad.
How are you?
Good.
Just making sure you're staying afloat. I know you got lots of stress.
Exams, college applications.
-Yeah, not to worry.
It's all under control.
-Oh, hey, Summer.
-Hi.
-Just in time for breakfast.
-Oh, thanks, Mr. C.
Actually, I was wondering if I could talk to Seth upstairs?
-Possibly alone.
-Okay.
All right, so-
- What the hell?
You lied about your college interview, and I don't like liars.
-l can explain.
-Explain what?
That you're pathological?
That you invent stories about interviews that never even happened?
You make it sound so bad.
Cohen, you are in a deceit spiral.
If you don't stop, you'll turn into one of those creepy men...
... withsecretatticswherethey hide stolen money and porn.
First of all, that sounds awesome.
Second of all, could be worse.
-l got scared.
-Scared?
Yeah.
Tongue-tied, dizzy, my bladder felt weak.
I just wanna know why you didn't tell me.
Because I was embarrassed.
You've got this natural confidence.
You're small and you're cute.
People like you.
I'm a social outcast with a mumbling problem.
-You're just realizing this now?
-lf we go to college together...
... everybody'sgonnaloveyou , and I'm gonna be your nerdy boyfriend.
I'm gonna be your not-so-bright girlfriend that can't keep up...
... wheneveryone'stalkingabout yakuza films and Proust.
-lt's Proust.
-See?
Look, we have to be honest with each other, or this is never gonna work.
-No, you're right.
-Anything else you need to tell me?
Because now's your chance.
Just put it out on the table.
No.
Okay.
Then you are officially exonerated.
Thesaurus again.
You wanna get down?
Hey, I didn't know we were working this weekend.
Thought maybe you and I'd go hit the links.
And ruin a sport I love?
It's the weekend, so I'm gonna make this brief.
I was at dinner last night with Kirsten at the yacht club.
I saw you there.
With Maya.
Griffin told Maya about meeting me, so she decided to get in touch.
-She asked you to dinner?
-She did.
Why, is it illegal to take a girl out to dinner?
You know, when Kirsten used to run this place...
... Isawalot ofcreepsinnicesuits that tried to use her to get to her father.
I didn't like it then, and I don't like it now.
We're trying to build a hospital that could service 1 00,000 uninsured.
You're trying to use a daughter to manipulate her father.
And you're comfortable with that.
Sandy, you're a great guy, but maybe you don't have the stomach for this.
We have to bend the rules if we wanna win the game.
That'd look great on a bumper sticker.
I wanna see you on Monday with a real game plan.
All right.
Hey.
-Kirsten let me in.
She seems really nice.
-What do you want?
Look, you've always been a really good guy to me.
You know, you've helped me with Volchok.
-Trusted me with Marissa--
-Now you're in love with her.
I told her.
I promised myself I would just live with these feelings, you know.
I wouldn't do anything about them.
But I just can't do that anymore.
What do you want, my blessing?
I guess, I just... .
Just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Thanks for that.
Leave.
Now.
I'm passionately devoted to my work on the board of the Children's Museum.
Children are so important, don't you think?
She's so phony.
Well, of course she is.
She lives in Newport.
Oh, God, mayday.
Taryn Baker just walked in.
Get out of there before she sees you.
Oh, too late.
Hi, Taryn.
Why are you all bundled up like that?
Has Newport been taken over by the Taliban?
I'd love to stay and chat, but I have to be going.
Oh, my goodness, it's Laura Cross.
Laura.
Hi.
-lt's me, Taryn, from Orchid Club.
-Oh, Taryn, of course.
-Do you know Julie?
-l have to go.
-We haven't met.
Julie?
-Julie?
Oh, my.
What a coincidence.
Have you been sitting at the next table this whole time?
Are you spying on me?
I... .
I'm sorry.
Hey.
There's a sale at Paul Frank if you wanna go.
Probably can't afford anything.
-But we could try stuff on.
-No, thanks.
I'm guessing you're still mad at me.
I know you may not believe this, but I'm trying to do you a favor.
Oh, yeah?
Well, thanks.
So far it's been a real blast.
Remember when we were little, and Dad used to take us to Baskin-Robbins?
You'd have to sample every flavor before you could decide what you wanted.
And then once you did, you'd realize you didn't like it, so you'd cry.
Dad would take you back to get another.
Another story about how growing up, it was always about me?
No. lt's about you not trusting your instincts.
-Maybe I'm not built that way.
-So?
It's a skill.
Learn it.
Make a decision and stick with it.
-Remember what I used to always get?
-Gold Medal Ribbon.
Every time.
I figured, I loved it, why question it?
Honey, you just missed Marissa.
-Marissa?
-Yeah.
She left this for you.
I'm sorry.
You wanna be with Johnny.
No. I'm sorry I ever made you wonder.
You two have a connection.
I get that. lt's not about him.
No, it's about me.
It was just...
... notbeingable to talk to you about Trey.
And then with Kaitlin coming back, her hooking up with Johnny...
... itthrewme foraloop .
-l think we can get past that.
-lt's not that easy.
You can't just snap your fingers and make everything the way it was.
Well, we can try.
Maybe start with dinner?
Oh, no.
This is KRKR TV.
And now for the latest news.
Early tonight, the captain of a Swedish icebreaker in the Barents Sea reported seeing a strange red fireball come out of the sky.
Says the captain, "It hovered above my ship for about a minute"--
Johnny.
Which Coop are you here to see?
I'm here to see you.
I thought maybe we could go to the beach.
For a night surfing lesson?
I was thinking more like bonfire and tequila.
Even better. I know where my mom keeps the stash.
So, what's the occasion?
Just feel like you and I never got a chance to party.
-What do you say?
-Okay.
-Hungry?
-Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
-l should have called.
-Oh, that's okay.
I figured you were here.
Who would've thought the Newport Group...
... wouldbewherelgo for a moment of Zen?
Sometimes this job makes you do a lot of hard thinking.
I want this hospital more than I've wanted anything in a long time.
Then you can't let Matt's relationship with Maya Griffin stand in your way.
She could be using him too.
Or they could live happily ever after.
The point is, if you want this as bad as I think you do...
... youhaveto go forit.
So where's the line?
I'm not worried about you knowing where the line is.
You always do. lt's who you are.
Coming.
-Cohen?
-Hang on.
Cohen, why is the door locked?
Cohen. I brought some DVDs.
Save the Last Dance and She's All That.
I know you're not interested...
... butI can'twatchanothermovie with Japanese people flying.
That's fine.
Let's go downstairs.
-That's fine?
Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm great.
Come on.
-What's that smell?
-lt is incense.
-l was doing yoga, plus I had bad gas.
-Gross.
Wish we brought something to mix it with.
Couple more sips, you won't even notice.
Okay, alky.
Can we just hook up already?
Before you pass out on me.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Well, it's just the fire, it's so romantic.
And the fire is actually kind of dying.
Well, okay then.
I'll just go find some driftwood.
Heat things up a bit.
What's that?
Nothing I wanna remember.
Where you going?
-Climb up there.
-Okay.
Tequila and rock climbing.
I'm not exactly sure that's the best combination.
So don't come.
Johnny, wait.
Go away, Gus.
I told you, I don't wanna play strip pinochle.
You play strip pinochle?
Long story.
What--?
What are you doing here?
I stopped by to thank you for fixing me up with Laura.
She's a wonderful woman.
Well, good. I'm glad it worked out with the two of you.
If you'll excuse me, I have a Hot Pocket in the microwave...
... anda winecoolerwith my name on it, so good luck.
What?
What do you want?
You.
Excuse me?
You can be manipulative.
You can be aggressive.
I've known you to stretch the truth on occasion.
But the fact is...
... whenI 'mnotaroundyou , I miss you.
You do?
What can I say?
I've fallen for you.
Well, this just may be your lucky night.
I have an extra Hot Pocket.
I'm almost to the top.
Johnny, would you just come down already?
-You're wasted.
-l'm not wasted.
Johnny, just come down.
-Stop it, that's high enough.
-l'm not gonna fall.
You're scaring me.
I get it.
You're awesome.
Just stop.
-Johnny!
Oh, my God.
-lt's okay!
Johnny!
-You see?
-Johnny, just come down.
I almost dropped it.
It's okay, I got it.
Johnny, please, just come down!
Seth is really into that movie.
Yeah, I know.
And he ate all of our dumplings.
I know it's gonna take more than Thai food and teen movies to sort this out...
... butifyouwannatalk ....
Talking's the last thing I feel like doing.
I figured, since you gave me the silent treatment the whole way in the car.
What do you want from me?
I want you.
-You wanna answer that?
-Not really.
-lt's Kaitlin.
-She's setting the mood.
All right.
Let me just get rid of her.
Setting the mood. I'm telling you.
Wait.
Kaitlin, let me call you back.
Can you come and get me?
-I'm at Westwood Cove with Johnny.
-No, I'm busy.
Yeah, you're getting busy.
No, but you don't understand.
I'm scared.
He's drunk and acting like a crazy person.
Come up here!
You gotta see this view!
-Johnny, just come down!
-What's that?
Marissa, it's him.
I'm telling you.
Johnny's in trouble, and I don 't know what to do.
Hold on.
She sounds really upset.
-lt's Johnny?
-Yeah, he's in trouble.
-Kaitlin?
-Ryan, you have to help me.
-He's drunk and he's gonna get hurt.
-He's really in trouble?
-Yes, come now.
-Be right there.
So that was... ?
That was Save the Last Dance, huh?
Okay, I know there weren't any subtitles or kung fu or whatever.
-But I thought it was good.
-l thought it was amazing.
That dance number at the end was so inspiring.
And, Summer, I'm so glad...
... I'mso,so glad...
... thatshegotinto Juilliard in the end.
And she did it for her mom.
For her mom, Summer.
Yeah, it wasn't that good.
This is pretty amazing too.
-lt's just a blue screen, Cohen.
-l know, but it's so blue.
I never realized how blue it was before.
I kind of like... .
I wanna go swimming in it or something.
-Yeah.
-For a little dippy-dip.
-Okay. lt's pretty blue.
-Yeah.
-Excuse me. I gotta go to the bathroom.
-Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
We should-- We should take our pants off.
Come on, Captain Oats.
We both know something's up.
Over there.
You go to Kaitlin.
I'll find another way up there.
-Keep him talking.
-Okay.
Be careful.
-Johnny, just come down!
-Kaitlin.
-Are you all right?
-Oh, I'm so happy that you're here.
Marissa.
Johnny, look, you have to get down from there.
Go home. I don't have anything to say to you.
We can get through this.
You're one of my best friends.
After all we've been through, I get to be your best friend.
Go away!
Leave me alone!
Come on, just let me explain it to you.
Just come down, Johnny.
Dude, you are the last person I wanna see now.
Let's get you down from there.
We can talk about it later, okay?
Right, right.
Right, so you can save me one more time in front of Marissa.
Hey, Marissa!
Marissa!
You wanna watch Ryan save me again?
-Just come down, Johnny, please?
-So she'll love you even more.
-Get back from the edge.
-Listen to her!
-Just be careful.
-Or what, I might fall?
You get to come in and grab me at the last second?

Hell, I could've taken them both.

WOMAN'S VOICE Hey, Meredith, it's Kristen.
You have to tell me what happened last night.
Call me.
MAN'S voice Hey, Meredith.
It's Derrick.
Where you been?
I've been trying to get ahold of you.
I got somebody who wants to meet.
The only way to find out who is by calling me back. lf you wanna solve that mystery, call me.
All right?
bye.
WOMAN'S VOICE Hey, Meredith.
Listen, don't say I don't got your back.
I know that guy ripped your heart out last time, but this one...
All right, Dean.
- This is the place.
- l gotta say Dad and me did just fine without these stupid costumes.
I feel like a high school drama dork.
What was that play that you did?
That
- What was it?
Our Town.
Yeah.
You were good.
It was cute.
You wanna pull this off, or not?
I'm saying these outfits cost hard-earned money, okay?
- Whose?
- Ours.
You think credit-card fraud's easy?
Thanks for letting us look around.
Well, police said they were done with the place, so...
You guys said you're with the alarm company?
That's right.
Well, no offense, but your alarm's about as useful as boobs on a man.
Well, that's why we're here.
See what went wrong, stop it from happening again.
- Now, ma'am, you found the body?
- Yeah.
Right after it happened.
- No.
Few days later.
Meredith's work called, she hadn't showed up.
I knocked on her door.
That's when I noticed the smell.
Any windows open?
Any sign of break-in?
No, windows were locked.
Door was bolted.
Chain was on the door.
We had to cut it.
- And the alarm was still on?
- Like I said...
- ...bang-up job your company's doing.
- Mm-hm.
You see any overturned furniture?
Broken glass?
Struggle?
Everything was in perfect condition.
Except Meredith.
- And what condition was Meredith in?
- Meredith was all over.
In pieces.
The guy who killed her must have been a wack job.
But, I'll tell you, if I didn't know any better, I'd have said a wild animal did it.
Ma'am, you mind if we take some time, give this place a once-over?
Go right ahead.
Knock yourself out.
So the killer walks in and out of the apartment.
- No weapons, no prints.
- l'm telling you the minute I found that article, I knew this was our kind of gig.
I think I agree with you.
You say you talked to the cops?
Uh, yeah.
Spoke to Amy, a charming, perky officer of the law.
- Yeah?
What did you find out?
- Well, she's a Sagittarius.
She loves tequila. I mean...
- Oh, and she's got this tattoo, right-
- Dean.
What?
Yeah.
Nothing we don't already know.
Except for one thing they're keeping out of the papers.
- Hm?
- Meredith's heart was missing.
- Her heart?
- Yeah, her heart.
So, what do you think did it?
The landlady said it looked like an animal attack.
Maybe it was.
- Werewolf?
- Not a werewolf.
The lunar cycle's not right.
Plus, if it was a creature, it would've left some kind of trace.
It's probably a spirit.
Mm.
See if you can find any masking tape around.
Ever see that symbol before?
Never.
Me neither.
Really?
You were a gymnast for five years?
- Well...
- Well...
Help here at the bar.
- Awesome.
Thanks.
- Talked to the bartender.
- You get anything?
- Besides her number.
- Dude.
I'm a professional.
I'm offended that you would think that.
All right.
You mind doing a little bit of thinking with your upstairs brain, Dean?
Huh?
There's nothing.
Meredith worked here.
She waited tables.
Everyone here is her friend.
They say she's normal.
She didn't do or say anything weird before she died.
So...
What about that symbol?
Anything?
Nothing.
It wasn't in Dad's journal or any of the usual books.
So I'll just have to dig a little deeper, I guess.
- There was a victim before Meredith?
- Right, yeah.
His name was...
His name was Ben Swardstrom.
He was mutilated.
Same deal, the door was locked, the alarm was on.
- ls there any connection between them?
- Nothing I can tell. I mean, not yet.
Ben was a banker, Meredith was a waitress.
They never met, never knew anyone in common.
From different worlds.
So the only successful intel we've scored so far is the bartender's phone number.
What?
Sam.
- Meg.
- Sam.
Sam, is that you?
Oh, my gosh.
- What are you doing here?
- l'm just in town visiting friends.
- Where are they?
- Well, they're not here right now.
But what about you, Meg?
You were going to California.
I did. I came, I saw, I conquered.
Oh, and I met what's-his-name, something Michael Murray, at a bar.
- Who?
- lt doesn't matter.
Anyway, the whole scene got old.
So I'm living here for a while.
- You're from Chicago?
- No.
Massachusetts.
Andover.
Gosh, Sam, what are the odds we'd run into each other?
Yeah, I know. I thought I'd never see you again.
Well, I'm glad you were wrong.
Dude.
Cover your mouth.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Meg.
This is...
This is my brother, Dean.
- This is Dean?
- Yeah.
- So you've heard of me?
- Oh, yeah.
I've heard of you.
Nice, the way you treat your brother like luggage.
- Sorry?
- Let him do what he wants to do.
Stop dragging him over God's green earth.
Meg. lt's all right.
Okay.
Awkward.
I'm gonna get a drink now.
Sam, I'm sorry.
It's just the way you told me he treats you...
- lf it were me, I'd kill him.
- lt's all right.
He means well.
- We should hook up while you're in town.
- Yeah.
- Show you a hell of a time.
- That's great.
Why don't you-
Why don't you give me your number.
312-555-0143.
- You know, I never got your last name.
- Masters.
- Masters?
- So you better call.
Scout's honor.
I hope to see you around, Sam.
- Who the hell was she?
- l don't really know.
I only met her once.
Meeting up with her again...
I don't know, man, it's weird.
Well, what was she saying?
I treat you like luggage?
What, were you bitching about me to a chick?
I'm sorry.
It was when we had that fight when I was in that bus stop in Indiana. lt's not important.
Any truth to it?
Am I keeping you against your will?
No, of course not.
Now, would you listen?
What?
- There's something strange going on.
- Tell me about it.
- She wasn't that into me.
- No, man.
I mean our kind of strange.
Maybe even a lead.
- Why do you say that?
- l met Meg weeks ago on the side of the road.
Now I run into her in some Chicago bar?
The bar where a waitress was slaughtered by something supernatural.
- Think that's weird?
- Coincidence.
It happens.
Well, yeah, it happens.
But not to us.
I could be wrong, but there's something about her...
- ...that I can't quite put my finger on.
- l bet you'd like to.
Maybe she's not a suspect.
You got a thing for her, huh?
Maybe you're thinking a little too much with the upstairs brain.
Huh?
Do me a favor.
Check if there's really a Meg Masters from Andover.
See if you can dig anything up...
- ...on that symbol on Meredith's floor.
- What are you gonna do?
- l'm gonna watch Meg.
- You are.
- l wanna see what's what.
Better safe.
- You little pervert.
- Dude.
- l'm going, I'm going.
- Hey.
- You're lurking outside her apartment?
No.
- Yes.
- Funny way of showing your affection.
- You find anything on her or what?
- She checks out.
There's a Masters in the phone book.
I pulled up her high school photo.
Why don't you go knock on her door and invite her to a poetry reading or whatever it is you do?
- What about the symbol?
Any luck?
I did have some luck.
It's...
Turns out it's Zoroastrian.
Very, very old school, like 2000 years before Christ.
It's a sigil for a Daeva.
- What's a Daeva?
- Translates to "demon of darkness."
Zoroastrian demons.
And they're savage, animalistic.
You know, nasty attitudes.
Kind of like demonic pit bulls.
- How'd you figure that out?
- Give me credit.
- l can chase paper too.
- Oh, yeah?
Name the last book you read.
I called Caleb, he told me, all right?
- Yeah.
- Here's the thing, Daevas they have to be summoned, conjured.
- So someone's controlling it?
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
From what I gather, it's pretty risky too.
They tend to bite the hand that feeds them.
- And the arms and torsos.
- So, what do they look like?
Nobody's seen them for a couple of millennia.
Summoning a demon that ancient, someone really knows their stuff.
I think we got a major player in town.
Why don't you give that girl a private strip-o-gram.
- Bite me.
- Bite her.
Don't leave teeth marks.
Just enough to where
- Sam?
You-
- No, no.
I'm- l'm just-
- Pervert.
I don't think you should come.
Because the brothers, they're in town. I didn't know that-
Yes, sir.
Yes. I'll be here waiting for you.
What the hell?
Dude, I gotta talk to you.
So hot little Meg is summoning the Daeva?
Looks like she was using that black altar to control the thing.
So Sammy's got a thing for the bad girl?
What's the deal with that bowl?
She talked into it, the way witches used to scry into crystal balls or entrails.
She was communicating.
- With the Daeva?
- No.
You said those things were savages.
No, this was someone different.
Someone who's giving her orders.
Someone who's coming to that warehouse.
Holy crap.
- What?
- What I was gonna tell you earlier.
I pulled a favor with my friend Amy over at the police department.
The complete records of the two victims.
We missed something the first time.
What?
The first victim, the old man, he spent his whole life in Chicago but he wasn't born here.
Look where he was born.
- Lawrence, Kansas.
- Mm-hm.
And Meredith, the second victim?
Turns out she was adopted.
Guess where she's from.
- Holy crap.
- Yeah.
It is where the demon killed Mom.
It's where everything started.
You think Meg's tied up with the demon?
- lt's a definite possibility.
- What's the significance of Lawrence?
- And how do these Daeva things fit in?
- Beats me.
I say we trash that black altar, grab Meg and have an interrogation.
No.
We can't.
We shouldn't tip her off.
We gotta stake out that warehouse.
We gotta see who...
- ...or what is showing up to meet her.
- l'll tell you one thing I don't think we should do this alone.
We think we got a serious lead on the thing that killed Mom.
So...
This warehouse, it's 1435 West Erie.
Dad, if you get this, get to Chicago as soon as you can.
- Voice mail?
- Yeah.
Jeez.
What'd you get?
I ransacked that trunk.
Holy water, every weapon that I could think of.
Exorcism rituals from about a half-dozen religions.
I'm not sure what to expect, so I guess we should just expect everything, huh?
- Big night.
- Yeah.
Nervous?
No.
No.
Are you?
No.
No way.
Could you imagine if we actually found that damn thing?
That demon?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
- l know. I'm just saying what if we did?
What if this whole thing was over tonight?
Man, I'd sleep for a month.
Go back to school.
Just be a person again.
- You wanna go back to school?
- Yeah, once we're done hunting it.
Huh.
- ls there something wrong with that?
- No.
No.
It's great.
Good for you.
I mean...
- What are you gonna do when it's over?
- lt's never gonna be over.
There's gonna be others.
There's gonna be something to hunt.
There's gotta be something you want for yourself.
Yeah, I don't want you to leave the second this thing's over, Sam.
Dude, what's your problem?
Why do you think I drag you everywhere?
Huh?
Why do you think I came...
- ...and got you at Stanford?
- Because Dad was in trouble.
- You wanted to find what killed Mom.
- Yes, that, but it's more than that, man.
You and me and Dad.
I mean, I want us to be together again.
I want us to be a family again.
Dean, we are a family.
I'd do anything for you.
But things will never be the way they were before.
Could be.
I don't want them to be.
I'm not gonna live this life forever.
Dean, when this is all over you're gonna have to let me go my own way.
Guys.
Hiding's a little bit childish, don't you think?
Well, that didn't work out like I'd planned.
Why don't you come out.
Sam I have to say, this puts a real crimp in our relationship.
Yeah, tell me about it.
- So where's your little Daeva friend?
- Around.
- The shotgun's not gonna do much good.
Well, don't worry, sweetheart.
Shotgun's not for the demon.
So who is it, Meg?
Who's coming?
Who are you waiting for?
You.
Aah!
Hey, Sam?
Don't take this the wrong way, but your girlfriend is a bitch.
This...
The whole thing was a trap.
Running into you at the bar.
Following you here hearing what you had to say.
It was all a setup, wasn't it?
- That the victims were from Lawrence?
Doesn't mean anything.
- lt was just to draw you in.
- You killed those two people for nothing.
Baby, I've killed a lot more for a lot less.
You trapped us.
Good for you.
It's Miller time.
Why don't you kill us already?
Not very quick on the uptake, are we?
This trap isn't for you.
Dad.
It's a trap for Dad.
Well, sweetheart, you're dumber than you look.
Because even if Dad was in town, which he is not he wouldn't walk into this.
He's too good.
He is pretty good, I'll give you that.
But you see...
- ...he has one weakness.
- What's that?
You.
He lets his guard down around his boys.
Lets his emotions cloud his judgments.
I happen to know he is in town.
And he'll come and try to save you.
And then the Daevas will kill everybody nice and slow and messy.
Well, I got news for you.
It's gonna take a lot more than some shadow to kill him.
Oh, the Daevas are in the room here.
They're invisible.
Their shadows are the only part you can see.
Why you doing this, Meg?
What kind of deal you got worked out here, huh?
- And with who?
- l'm doing this for the same reasons you do what you do.
Loyalty.
Love.
Like the love you have for Mommy.
- And Jess.
- Go to hell.
Baby, I'm already there.
Come on, Sam.
There's no need to be nasty.
I think we both know how you really feel about me.
You know I saw you watching me changing in my apartment.
It turned you on, didn't it?
- Get a room, you two.
- l didn't mind.
I liked that you were watching me.
Come on, Sammy.
You and I can still have a little dirty fun.
You wanna have fun?
Go ahead then.
I'm a little tied up right now.
Now, were you just trying to distract me while your brother cuts free?
No.
It was because I have a knife of my own.
- Aah!
- Sam.
Get the altar.
Aah!
No.
No.
No.
Yeah.
There.
So I guess the Daevas didn't like being bossed around.
I guess not.
- Hey, Sam?
- Hm?
Next time you wanna get laid find a girl that's not so buckets of crazy, huh?
Why didn't you just leave that stuff in the car?
I said it before and I'll say it again:
Better safe than sorry.
Hey.
- Dad?
- Hey, boys.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hey, Dad.
Dad, it was a trap.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I thought it might have been.
- Were you there?
Yeah.
I got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive.
She was the bad guy, right?
Yes, sir.
- Good.
Well, it doesn't surprise me.
It's tried to stop me before.
- The demon has?
It knows I'm close.
It knows I'm gonna kill it.
Not just exorcise it or send it back to hell.
Actually kill it.
How?
I'm working on that.
Well, let us come with you.
We'll help.
No, Sam.
Not yet.
Listen, try to understand this demon is a scary son of a bitch.
I don't want you in the crossfire.
I don't want you hurt.
- Dad, you don't have to worry about us.
Of course I do.
I'm your father.
Listen, Sammy, last time we were together we had one hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Too long.
No!
Shut your eyes.
These things are shadow demons.
So let's light them up.
- Dad.
Over here.
All right.
Come on.
We don't have much time.
Soon as the flare's out, they'll be back.
No, wait.
Wait.
Sam, wait.
- Dad, you can't come with us.
- What?
What are you talking about?
- You boys...
You're beat to hell.
- We'll be all right.
Dean, we should stick together.
- We'll go after this demon together.
- Sam, listen to me.
We almost got Dad killed in there.
Don't you understand?
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
I mean, Meg was right.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
He's stronger without us around.
Dad.
No.
After everything.
After all the time we've spent looking for you...
Please.
- l gotta be a part of this fight.
- Sammy, this fight is just starting.
And we are all gonna have a part to play.
For now, you gotta trust me, son.
Okay?
You gotta let me go.
Be careful, boys.
Come on.

You guys said you're with the alarm company?
That's right.
Well, no offense, but your alarm's about as useful as boobs on a man.
Well, that's why we're here.
See what went wrong, stop it from happening again.
-Now, ma'am, you found the body?
-Yeah.
SAM:
Right after it happened.
-No.
Few days later.
Meredith's work called, she hadn't showed up.
WOMAN:
I knocked on her door.
That's when I noticed the smell.
Any windows open?
Any sign of break-in?
No, windows were locked.
Door was bolted.
Chain was on the door.
We had to cut it.
-And the alarm was still on?
-Like I said...
-...bang-up job your company's doing.
-Mm-hm.
You see any overturned furniture?
Broken glass?
Struggle?
Everything was in perfect condition.
Except Meredith.
-And what condition was Meredith in?
-Meredith was all over.
In pieces.
WOMAN:
The guy who killed her must have been a wack job.
But, I'll tell you, if I didn't know any better, I'd have said a wild animal did it.
Ma'am, you mind if we take some time, give this place a once-over?
Go right ahead.
Knock yourself out.
So the killer walks in and out of the apartment.
-No weapons, no prints.
-l'm telling you the minute I found that article, I knew this was our kind of gig.
I think I agree with you.
You say you talked to the cops?
Uh, yeah.
Spoke to Amy, a charming, perky officer of the law.
-Yeah?
What did you find out?
-Well, she's a Sagittarius.
She loves tequila. I mean....
-Oh, and she's got this tattoo, right--
-Dean.
What?
Yeah.
Nothing we don't already know.
Except for one thing they're keeping out of the papers.
-Hm?
-Meredith's heart was missing.
-Her heart?
-Yeah, her heart.
So, what do you think did it?
The landlady said it looked like an animal attack.
Maybe it was.
-Werewolf?
-Not a werewolf.
The lunar cycle's not right.
Plus, if it was a creature, it would've left some kind of trace.
It's probably a spirit.
Mm.
See if you can find any masking tape around.
Ever see that symbol before?
DEAN:
Never.
Me neither.
[ROCK music playing]
Really?
You were a gymnast for five years?
-Well....
-Well....
[chattering]
WOMAN:
Help here at the bar.
-Awesome.
Thanks.
-Talked to the bartender.
-You get anything?
-Besides her number.
-Dude.
I'm a professional.
I'm offended that you would think that.
All right.
You mind doing a little bit of thinking with your upstairs brain, Dean?
Huh?
There's nothing.
Meredith worked here.
She waited tables.
Everyone here is her friend.
They say she's normal.
She didn't do or say anything weird before she died.
So....
What about that symbol?
Anything?
Nothing.
It wasn't in Dad's journal or any of the usual books.
So I'll just have to dig a little deeper, I guess.
-There was a victim before Meredith?
-Right, yeah.
His name was....
His name was Ben Swardstrom.
He was mutilated.
Same deal, the door was locked, the alarm was on.
-ls there any connection between them?
-Nothing I can tell. I mean, not yet.
Ben was a banker, Meredith was a waitress.
They never met, never knew anyone in common.
From different worlds.
So the only successful intel we've scored so far is the bartender's phone number.
What?
Sam.
-Meg.
-Sam.
Sam, is that you?
Oh, my gosh.
-What are you doing here?
-l'm just in town visiting friends.
-Where are they?
-Well, they're not here right now.
But what about you, Meg?
You were going to California.
I did. I came, I saw, I conquered.
Oh, and I met what's-his-name, something Michael Murray, at a bar.
-Who?
-lt doesn't matter.
Anyway, the whole scene got old.
So I'm living here for a while.
[CLEARS THROAT]
-You're from Chicago?
-No.
Massachusetts.
Andover.
Gosh, Sam, what are the odds we'd run into each other?
Yeah, I know. I thought I'd never see you again.
Well, I'm glad you were wrong.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Dude.
Cover your mouth.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Meg.
This is....
This is my brother, Dean.
-This is Dean?
-Yeah.
-So you've heard of me?
-Oh, yeah.
I've heard of you.
Nice, the way you treat your brother like luggage.
-Sorry?
-Let him do what he wants to do.
Stop dragging him over God's green earth.
Meg. lt's all right.
[whistles]
Okay.
Awkward.
I'm gonna get a drink now.
Sam, I'm sorry.
It's just the way you told me he treats you....
-lf it were me, I'd kill him.
-lt's all right.
He means well.
-We should hook up while you're in town.
-Yeah.
-Show you a hell of a time.
-That's great.
Why don't you--
Why don't you give me your number.
312-555-0143.
-You know, I never got your last name.
-Masters.
-Masters?
-So you better call.
Scout's honor.
I hope to see you around, Sam.
-Who the hell was she?
-l don't really know.
I only met her once.
Meeting up with her again....
I don't know, man, it's weird.
Well, what was she saying?
I treat you like luggage?
What, were you bitching about me to a chick?
I'm sorry.
It was when we had that fight when I was in that bus stop in Indiana. lt's not important.
Any truth to it?
Am I keeping you against your will?
No, of course not.
Now, would you listen?
What?
-There's something strange going on.
-Tell me about it.
-She wasn't that into me.
-No, man.
I mean our kind of strange.
Maybe even a lead.
-Why do you say that?
-l met Meg weeks ago on the side of the road.
Now I run into her in some Chicago bar?
The bar where a waitress was slaughtered by something supernatural.
-Think that's weird?
-Coincidence.
It happens.
Well, yeah, it happens.
But not to us.
I could be wrong, but there's something about her...
-...that I can't quite put my finger on.
-l bet you'd like to.
Maybe she's not a suspect.
You got a thing for her, huh?
Maybe you're thinking a little too much with the upstairs brain.
Huh?
Do me a favor.
Check if there's really a Meg Masters from Andover.
See if you can dig anything up...
-...on that symbol on Meredith's floor.
-What are you gonna do?
-l'm gonna watch Meg.
-You are.
-l wanna see what's what.
Better safe.
-You little pervert.
-Dude.
-l'm going, I'm going.
[PHONE ringing]
-Hey.
-You're lurking outside her apartment?
No.
-Yes.
-Funny way of showing your affection.
-You find anything on her or what?
-She checks out.
There's a Masters in the phone book.
I pulled up her high school photo.
Why don't you go knock on her door and invite her to a poetry reading or whatever it is you do?
-What about the symbol?
Any luck?
DEAN [ON PHONE]:
I did have some luck.
It's....
Turns out it's Zoroastrian.
Very, very old school, like 2000 years before Christ.
It's a sigil for a Daeva.
-What's a Daeva?
-Translates to "demon of darkness."
Zoroastrian demons.
And they're savage, animalistic.
You know, nasty attitudes.
Kind of like demonic pit bulls.
-How'd you figure that out?
-Give me credit.
-l can chase paper too.
-Oh, yeah?
Name the last book you read.
I called Caleb, he told me, all right?
-Yeah.
-Here's the thing, Daevas they have to be summoned, conjured.
-So someone's controlling it?
-Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
From what I gather, it's pretty risky too.
They tend to bite the hand that feeds them.
-And the arms and torsos.
-So, what do they look like?
Nobody's seen them for a couple of millennia.
Summoning a demon that ancient, someone really knows their stuff.
I think we got a major player in town.
Why don't you give that girl a private strip-o-gram.
-Bite me.
-Bite her.
Don't leave teeth marks.
Just enough to where-
- Sam?
You--
[CLEARS THROAT]
-No, no.
I'm-- l'm just--
-Pervert.
[CHANTING in FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
I don't think you should come.
Because the brothers, they're in town. I didn't know that--
Yes, sir.
MEG:
Yes. I'll be here waiting for you.
What the hell?
[IN unison] Dude, I gotta talk to you.
So hot little Meg is summoning the Daeva?
Looks like she was using that black altar to control the thing.
So Sammy's got a thing for the bad girl?
What's the deal with that bowl?
She talked into it, the way witches used to scry into crystal balls or entrails.
She was communicating.
-With the Daeva?
-No.
You said those things were savages.
No, this was someone different.
Someone who's giving her orders.
Someone who's coming to that warehouse.
Holy crap.
-What?
-What I was gonna tell you earlier.
I pulled a favor with my friend Amy over at the police department.
The complete records of the two victims.
We missed something the first time.
What?
The first victim, the old man, he spent his whole life in Chicago but he wasn't born here.
Look where he was born.
-Lawrence, Kansas.
-Mm-hm.
And Meredith, the second victim?
Turns out she was adopted.
Guess where she's from.
-Holy crap.
-Yeah.
It is where the demon killed Mom.
It's where everything started.
You think Meg's tied up with the demon?
-lt's a definite possibility.
-What's the significance of Lawrence?
-And how do these Daeva things fit in?
-Beats me.
I say we trash that black altar, grab Meg and have an interrogation.
No.
We can't.
We shouldn't tip her off.
We gotta stake out that warehouse.
We gotta see who...
-...or what is showing up to meet her.
-l'll tell you one thing I don't think we should do this alone.
We think we got a serious lead on the thing that killed Mom.
So....
This warehouse, it's 1435 West Erie.
Dad, if you get this, get to Chicago as soon as you can.
-Voice mail?
-Yeah.
Jeez.
What'd you get?
I ransacked that trunk.
Holy water, every weapon that I could think of.
Exorcism rituals from about a half-dozen religions.
I'm not sure what to expect, so I guess we should just expect everything, huh?
-Big night.
-Yeah.
Nervous?
No.
No.
Are you?
No.
No way.
Could you imagine if we actually found that damn thing?
That demon?
-Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
-l know. I'm just saying what if we did?
What if this whole thing was over tonight?
Man, I'd sleep for a month.
Go back to school.
Just be a person again.
-You wanna go back to school?
-Yeah, once we're done hunting it.
Huh.
-ls there something wrong with that?
-No.
No.
It's great.
Good for you.
I mean....
-What are you gonna do when it's over?
-lt's never gonna be over.
There's gonna be others.
There's gonna be something to hunt.
There's gotta be something you want for yourself.
Yeah, I don't want you to leave the second this thing's over, Sam.
Dude, what's your problem?
[DEAN CHUCKLES]
Why do you think I drag you everywhere?
Huh?
Why do you think I came...
-...and got you at Stanford?
-Because Dad was in trouble.
-You wanted to find what killed Mom.
-Yes, that, but it's more than that, man.
You and me and Dad.
I mean, I want us to be together again.
I want us to be a family again.
Dean, we are a family.
I'd do anything for you.
But things will never be the way they were before.
Could be.
I don't want them to be.
I'm not gonna live this life forever.
Dean, when this is all over you're gonna have to let me go my own way.
[MEG chanting]
MEG:
Guys.
Hiding's a little bit childish, don't you think?
Well, that didn't work out like I'd planned.
Why don't you come out.
Sam I have to say, this puts a real crimp in our relationship.
Yeah, tell me about it.
-So where's your little Daeva friend?
-Around.
-The shotgun's not gonna do much good.
DEAN:
Well, don't worry, sweetheart.
Shotgun's not for the demon.
So who is it, Meg?
Who's coming?
Who are you waiting for?
You.
[GRUNTlNG]
Aah!
Hey, Sam?
Don't take this the wrong way, but your girlfriend is a bitch.
SAM:
This....
The whole thing was a trap.
Running into you at the bar.
SAM:
Following you here hearing what you had to say.
It was all a setup, wasn't it?
-That the victims were from Lawrence?
MEG:
Doesn't mean anything.
-lt was just to draw you in.
-You killed those two people for nothing.
Baby, I've killed a lot more for a lot less.
DEAN:
You trapped us.
Good for you.
It's Miller time.
Why don't you kill us already?
Not very quick on the uptake, are we?
This trap isn't for you.
Dad.
It's a trap for Dad.
Well, sweetheart, you're dumber than you look.
Because even if Dad was in town, which he is not he wouldn't walk into this.
He's too good.
He is pretty good, I'll give you that.
But you see...
-...he has one weakness.
-What's that?
You.
He lets his guard down around his boys.
Lets his emotions cloud his judgments.
I happen to know he is in town.
And he'll come and try to save you.
And then the Daevas will kill everybody nice and slow and messy.
DEAN:
Well, I got news for you.
It's gonna take a lot more than some shadow to kill him.
MEG:
Oh, the Daevas are in the room here.
They're invisible.
Their shadows are the only part you can see.
SAM:
Why you doing this, Meg?
What kind of deal you got worked out here, huh?
-And with who?
-l'm doing this for the same reasons you do what you do.
Loyalty.
Love.
Like the love you have for Mommy.
-And Jess.
-Go to hell.
Baby, I'm already there.
Come on, Sam.
There's no need to be nasty.
I think we both know how you really feel about me.
You know I saw you watching me changing in my apartment.
It turned you on, didn't it?
-Get a room, you two.
-l didn't mind.
I liked that you were watching me.
Come on, Sammy.
You and I can still have a little dirty fun.
You wanna have fun?
Go ahead then.
I'm a little tied up right now.
[METAL clinking]
Now, were you just trying to distract me while your brother cuts free?
No.
It was because I have a knife of my own.
-Aah!
-Sam.
Get the altar.
Aah!
MEG:
No.
No.
No.
[screaming]
Yeah.
There.
So I guess the Daevas didn't like being bossed around.
I guess not.
-Hey, Sam?
-Hm?
Next time you wanna get laid find a girl that's not so buckets of crazy, huh?
Why didn't you just leave that stuff in the car?
I said it before and I'll say it again:
Better safe than sorry.
Hey.
-Dad?
-Hey, boys.
-Hi, Sam.
-Hey, Dad.
Dad, it was a trap.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I thought it might have been.
-Were you there?
JOHN:
Yeah.
I got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive.
She was the bad guy, right?
[IN unison]:
Yes, sir.
-Good.
Well, it doesn't surprise me.
It's tried to stop me before.
-The demon has?
JOHN:
It knows I'm close.
It knows I'm gonna kill it.
JOHN:
Not just exorcise it or send it back to hell.
Actually kill it.
How?
I'm working on that.
Well, let us come with you.
We'll help.
No, Sam.
Not yet.
Listen, try to understand this demon is a scary son of a bitch.
I don't want you in the crossfire.
I don't want you hurt.
-Dad, you don't have to worry about us.
JOHN:
Of course I do.
I'm your father.
Listen, Sammy, last time we were together we had one hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Too long.
[sniffs]
No!
[screaming]
Shut your eyes.
These things are shadow demons.
So let's light them up.
[coughing]
-Dad.
SAM:
Over here.
[GRUNTlNG]
All right.
Come on.
We don't have much time.
Soon as the flare's out, they'll be back.
No, wait.
Wait.
Sam, wait.
-Dad, you can't come with us.
-What?
What are you talking about?
-You boys....
You're beat to hell.
-We'll be all right.
Dean, we should stick together.
-We'll go after this demon together.
-Sam, listen to me.
We almost got Dad killed in there.
Don't you understand?
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
I mean, Meg was right.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
He's stronger without us around.
Dad.
No.
After everything.
After all the time we've spent looking for you....
Please.
-l gotta be a part of this fight.
-Sammy, this fight is just starting.
And we are all gonna have a part to play.
For now, you gotta trust me, son.
Okay?
You gotta let me go.
Be careful, boys.
Come on.
[ENGLISH SDH]
NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:
-Dad.
This is bigger than you think.
They're everywhere.
He wants us to pick up where he left off.
Saving people.
Hunting things.
The family business.
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.
You're a selfish bastard, you know that?
You just do whatever you want.
Hey, I'm taking off.
I will leave your ass, you hear me?
SAM:
That's what I want you to do.
-l'm Meg.
Sam.
So where you headed?
No way I'm telling you.
-Why not?
-You could be some kind of freak.
It makes no sense.
Hell, I could've taken them both.
Why let them go?
[BLUES music PLAYING ON radio]
[RADIO cutting OUT]
-Great.

Meredith.
Hello.

WOMAN'S VOICE [ON intercom]:

Hey, Meredith, it's Kristen.
You have to tell me what happened last night.
Call me.
MAN'S voice [ON MACHINE]:
Hey, Meredith.
It's Derrick.
Where you been?
I've been trying to get ahold of you.
I got somebody who wants to meet.
The only way to find out who is by calling me back. lf you wanna solve that mystery, call me.
All right?
bye.
WOMAN'S VOICE [ON machine]:
Hey, Meredith.
Listen, don't say I don't got your back.
I know that guy ripped your heart out last time, but this one....
[screaming]
[ROCK music playing ON RADIO]
All right, Dean.
-This is the place.
-l gotta say Dad and me did just fine without these stupid costumes.
I feel like a high school drama dork.
What was that play that you did?
That-
- What was it?
Our Town.
Yeah.
You were good.
It was cute.
You wanna pull this off, or not?
I'm saying these outfits cost hard-earned money, okay?
-Whose?
-Ours.
You think credit-card fraud's easy?
Thanks for letting us look around.
Well, police said they were done with the place, so....

Do me a favor.
Check if there's really a Meg Masters from Andover.
See if you can dig anything up...
-...on that symbol on Meredith's floor.
-What are you gonna do?
-l'm gonna watch Meg.
-You are.
-l wanna see what's what.
Better safe.
-You little pervert.
-Dude.
-l'm going, I'm going.
[PHONE ringing]
-Hey.
-You're lurking outside her apartment?
No.
-Yes.
-Funny way of showing your affection.
-You find anything on her or what?
-She checks out.
There's a Masters in the phone book.
I pulled up her high school photo.
Why don't you go knock on her door and invite her to a poetry reading or whatever it is you do?
-What about the symbol?
Any luck?
DEAN [ON PHONE]:
I did have some luck.
It's....
Turns out it's Zoroastrian.
Very, very old school, like 2000 years before Christ.
It's a sigil for a Daeva.
-What's a Daeva?
-Translates to "demon of darkness."
Zoroastrian demons.
And they're savage, animalistic.
You know, nasty attitudes.
Kind of like demonic pit bulls.
-How'd you figure that out?
-Give me credit.
-l can chase paper too.
-Oh, yeah?
Name the last book you read.
I called Caleb, he told me, all right?
-Yeah.
-Here's the thing, Daevas they have to be summoned, conjured.
-So someone's controlling it?
-Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
From what I gather, it's pretty risky too.
They tend to bite the hand that feeds them.
-And the arms and torsos.
-So, what do they look like?
Nobody's seen them for a couple of millennia.
Summoning a demon that ancient, someone really knows their stuff.
I think we got a major player in town.
Why don't you give that girl a private strip-o-gram.
-Bite me.
-Bite her.
Don't leave teeth marks.
Just enough to where-
- Sam?
You--
[CLEARS THROAT]
-No, no.
I'm-- l'm just--
-Pervert.
[CHANTING in FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
I don't think you should come.
Because the brothers, they're in town. I didn't know that--
Yes, sir.
MEG:
Yes. I'll be here waiting for you.
What the hell?
[IN unison] Dude, I gotta talk to you.
So hot little Meg is summoning the Daeva?
Looks like she was using that black altar to control the thing.
So Sammy's got a thing for the bad girl?
What's the deal with that bowl?
She talked into it, the way witches used to scry into crystal balls or entrails.
She was communicating.
-With the Daeva?
-No.
You said those things were savages.
No, this was someone different.
Someone who's giving her orders.
Someone who's coming to that warehouse.
Holy crap.
-What?
-What I was gonna tell you earlier.
I pulled a favor with my friend Amy over at the police department.
The complete records of the two victims.
We missed something the first time.
What?
The first victim, the old man, he spent his whole life in Chicago but he wasn't born here.
Look where he was born.
-Lawrence, Kansas.
-Mm-hm.
And Meredith, the second victim?
Turns out she was adopted.
Guess where she's from.
-Holy crap.
-Yeah.
It is where the demon killed Mom.
It's where everything started.
You think Meg's tied up with the demon?
-lt's a definite possibility.
-What's the significance of Lawrence?
-And how do these Daeva things fit in?
-Beats me.
I say we trash that black altar, grab Meg and have an interrogation.
No.
We can't.
We shouldn't tip her off.
We gotta stake out that warehouse.
We gotta see who...
-...or what is showing up to meet her.
-l'll tell you one thing I don't think we should do this alone.
We think we got a serious lead on the thing that killed Mom.
So....
This warehouse, it's 1435 West Erie.
Dad, if you get this, get to Chicago as soon as you can.
-Voice mail?
-Yeah.
Jeez.
What'd you get?
I ransacked that trunk.
Holy water, every weapon that I could think of.
Exorcism rituals from about a half-dozen religions.
I'm not sure what to expect, so I guess we should just expect everything, huh?
-Big night.
-Yeah.
Nervous?
No.
No.
Are you?
No.
No way.
Could you imagine if we actually found that damn thing?
That demon?
-Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
-l know. I'm just saying what if we did?
What if this whole thing was over tonight?
Man, I'd sleep for a month.
Go back to school.
Just be a person again.
-You wanna go back to school?
-Yeah, once we're done hunting it.
Huh.
-ls there something wrong with that?
-No.
No.
It's great.
Good for you.
I mean....
-What are you gonna do when it's over?
-lt's never gonna be over.
There's gonna be others.
There's gonna be something to hunt.
There's gotta be something you want for yourself.
Yeah, I don't want you to leave the second this thing's over, Sam.
Dude, what's your problem?
[DEAN CHUCKLES]
Why do you think I drag you everywhere?
Huh?
Why do you think I came...
-...and got you at Stanford?
-Because Dad was in trouble.
-You wanted to find what killed Mom.
-Yes, that, but it's more than that, man.
You and me and Dad.
I mean, I want us to be together again.
I want us to be a family again.
Dean, we are a family.
I'd do anything for you.
But things will never be the way they were before.
Could be.
I don't want them to be.
I'm not gonna live this life forever.
Dean, when this is all over you're gonna have to let me go my own way.
[MEG chanting]
MEG:
Guys.
Hiding's a little bit childish, don't you think?
Well, that didn't work out like I'd planned.
Why don't you come out.
Sam I have to say, this puts a real crimp in our relationship.
Yeah, tell me about it.
-So where's your little Daeva friend?
-Around.
-The shotgun's not gonna do much good.
DEAN:
Well, don't worry, sweetheart.
Shotgun's not for the demon.
So who is it, Meg?
Who's coming?
Who are you waiting for?
You.
[GRUNTlNG]
Aah!
Hey, Sam?
Don't take this the wrong way, but your girlfriend is a bitch.
SAM:
This....
The whole thing was a trap.
Running into you at the bar.
SAM:
Following you here hearing what you had to say.
It was all a setup, wasn't it?
-That the victims were from Lawrence?
MEG:
Doesn't mean anything.
-lt was just to draw you in.
-You killed those two people for nothing.
Baby, I've killed a lot more for a lot less.
DEAN:
You trapped us.
Good for you.
It's Miller time.
Why don't you kill us already?
Not very quick on the uptake, are we?
This trap isn't for you.
Dad.
It's a trap for Dad.
Well, sweetheart, you're dumber than you look.
Because even if Dad was in town, which he is not he wouldn't walk into this.
He's too good.
He is pretty good, I'll give you that.
But you see...
-...he has one weakness.
-What's that?
You.
He lets his guard down around his boys.
Lets his emotions cloud his judgments.
I happen to know he is in town.
And he'll come and try to save you.
And then the Daevas will kill everybody nice and slow and messy.
DEAN:
Well, I got news for you.
It's gonna take a lot more than some shadow to kill him.
MEG:
Oh, the Daevas are in the room here.
They're invisible.
Their shadows are the only part you can see.
SAM:
Why you doing this, Meg?
What kind of deal you got worked out here, huh?
-And with who?
-l'm doing this for the same reasons you do what you do.
Loyalty.
Love.
Like the love you have for Mommy.
-And Jess.
-Go to hell.
Baby, I'm already there.
Come on, Sam.
There's no need to be nasty.
I think we both know how you really feel about me.
You know I saw you watching me changing in my apartment.
It turned you on, didn't it?
-Get a room, you two.
-l didn't mind.
I liked that you were watching me.
Come on, Sammy.
You and I can still have a little dirty fun.
You wanna have fun?
Go ahead then.
I'm a little tied up right now.
[METAL clinking]
Now, were you just trying to distract me while your brother cuts free?
No.
It was because I have a knife of my own.
-Aah!
-Sam.
Get the altar.
Aah!
MEG:
No.
No.
No.
[screaming]
Yeah.
There.
So I guess the Daevas didn't like being bossed around.
I guess not.
-Hey, Sam?
-Hm?
Next time you wanna get laid find a girl that's not so buckets of crazy, huh?
Why didn't you just leave that stuff in the car?
I said it before and I'll say it again:
Better safe than sorry.
Hey.
-Dad?
-Hey, boys.
-Hi, Sam.
-Hey, Dad.
Dad, it was a trap.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I thought it might have been.
-Were you there?
JOHN:
Yeah.
I got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive.
She was the bad guy, right?
[IN unison]:
Yes, sir.
-Good.
Well, it doesn't surprise me.
It's tried to stop me before.
-The demon has?
JOHN:
It knows I'm close.
It knows I'm gonna kill it.
JOHN:
Not just exorcise it or send it back to hell.
Actually kill it.
How?
I'm working on that.
Well, let us come with you.
We'll help.
No, Sam.
Not yet.
Listen, try to understand this demon is a scary son of a bitch.
I don't want you in the crossfire.
I don't want you hurt.
-Dad, you don't have to worry about us.
JOHN:
Of course I do.
I'm your father.
Listen, Sammy, last time we were together we had one hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Too long.
[sniffs]
No!
[screaming]
Shut your eyes.
These things are shadow demons.
So let's light them up.
[coughing]
-Dad.
SAM:
Over here.
[GRUNTlNG]
All right.
Come on.
We don't have much time.
Soon as the flare's out, they'll be back.
No, wait.
Wait.
Sam, wait.
-Dad, you can't come with us.
-What?
What are you talking about?
-You boys....
You're beat to hell.
-We'll be all right.
Dean, we should stick together.
-We'll go after this demon together.
-Sam, listen to me.
We almost got Dad killed in there.
Don't you understand?
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
I mean, Meg was right.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
He's stronger without us around.
Dad.
No.
After everything.
After all the time we've spent looking for you....
Please.
-l gotta be a part of this fight.
-Sammy, this fight is just starting.
And we are all gonna have a part to play.
For now, you gotta trust me, son.
Okay?
You gotta let me go.
Be careful, boys.
Come on.
[ENGLISH SDH]
NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:
-Dad.
This is bigger than you think.
They're everywhere.
He wants us to pick up where he left off.
Saving people.
Hunting things.
The family business.
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.
You're a selfish bastard, you know that?
You just do whatever you want.
Hey, I'm taking off.
I will leave your ass, you hear me?
SAM:
That's what I want you to do.
-l'm Meg.
Sam.
So where you headed?
No way I'm telling you.
-Why not?
-You could be some kind of freak.
It makes no sense.
Hell, I could've taken them both.
Why let them go?
[BLUES music PLAYING ON radio]
[RADIO cutting OUT]
-Great.
FEMALE voice:
Meredith.
Meredith.
Hello.
FEMALE voice:
Meredith.
Meredith.
[ALARM beeping]
WOMAN'S VOICE [ON intercom]:
System disarmed.
System armed.
WOMAN'S VOICE [ON machine]:
Hey, Meredith, it's Kristen.
You have to tell me what happened last night.
Call me.
MAN'S voice [ON MACHINE]:
Hey, Meredith.
It's Derrick.
Where you been?
I've been trying to get ahold of you.
I got somebody who wants to meet.
The only way to find out who is by calling me back. lf you wanna solve that mystery, call me.
All right?
bye.
WOMAN'S VOICE [ON machine]:
Hey, Meredith.
Listen, don't say I don't got your back.
I know that guy ripped your heart out last time, but this one....
[screaming]
[ROCK music playing ON RADIO]
All right, Dean.
-This is the place.
-l gotta say Dad and me did just fine without these stupid costumes.
I feel like a high school drama dork.
What was that play that you did?
That-
- What was it?
Our Town.
Yeah.
You were good.
It was cute.
You wanna pull this off, or not?
I'm saying these outfits cost hard-earned money, okay?
-Whose?
-Ours.
You think credit-card fraud's easy?
Thanks for letting us look around.
Well, police said they were done with the place, so....
You guys said you're with the alarm company?
That's right.
Well, no offense, but your alarm's about as useful as boobs on a man.
Well, that's why we're here.
See what went wrong, stop it from happening again.
-Now, ma'am, you found the body?
-Yeah.
SAM:
Right after it happened.
-No.
Few days later.
Meredith's work called, she hadn't showed up.
WOMAN:
I knocked on her door.
That's when I noticed the smell.
Any windows open?
Any sign of break-in?
No, windows were locked.
Door was bolted.
Chain was on the door.
We had to cut it.
-And the alarm was still on?
-Like I said...
-...bang-up job your company's doing.
-Mm-hm.
You see any overturned furniture?
Broken glass?
Struggle?
Everything was in perfect condition.
Except Meredith.
-And what condition was Meredith in?
-Meredith was all over.
In pieces.
WOMAN:
The guy who killed her must have been a wack job.
But, I'll tell you, if I didn't know any better, I'd have said a wild animal did it.
Ma'am, you mind if we take some time, give this place a once-over?
Go right ahead.
Knock yourself out.
So the killer walks in and out of the apartment.
-No weapons, no prints.
-l'm telling you the minute I found that article, I knew this was our kind of gig.
I think I agree with you.
You say you talked to the cops?
Uh, yeah.
Spoke to Amy, a charming, perky officer of the law.
-Yeah?
What did you find out?
-Well, she's a Sagittarius.
She loves tequila. I mean....
-Oh, and she's got this tattoo, right--
-Dean.
What?
Yeah.
Nothing we don't already know.
Except for one thing they're keeping out of the papers.
-Hm?
-Meredith's heart was missing.
-Her heart?
-Yeah, her heart.
So, what do you think did it?
The landlady said it looked like an animal attack.
Maybe it was.
-Werewolf?
-Not a werewolf.
The lunar cycle's not right.
Plus, if it was a creature, it would've left some kind of trace.
It's probably a spirit.
Mm.
See if you can find any masking tape around.
Ever see that symbol before?
DEAN:
Never.
Me neither.
[ROCK music playing]
Really?
You were a gymnast for five years?
-Well....
-Well....
[chattering]
WOMAN:
Help here at the bar.
-Awesome.
Thanks.
-Talked to the bartender.
-You get anything?
-Besides her number.
-Dude.
I'm a professional.
I'm offended that you would think that.
All right.
You mind doing a little bit of thinking with your upstairs brain, Dean?
Huh?
There's nothing.
Meredith worked here.
She waited tables.
Everyone here is her friend.
They say she's normal.
She didn't do or say anything weird before she died.
So....
What about that symbol?
Anything?
Nothing.
It wasn't in Dad's journal or any of the usual books.
So I'll just have to dig a little deeper, I guess.
-There was a victim before Meredith?
-Right, yeah.
His name was....
His name was Ben Swardstrom.
He was mutilated.
Same deal, the door was locked, the alarm was on.
-ls there any connection between them?
-Nothing I can tell. I mean, not yet.
Ben was a banker, Meredith was a waitress.
They never met, never knew anyone in common.
From different worlds.
So the only successful intel we've scored so far is the bartender's phone number.
What?
Sam.
-Meg.
-Sam.
Sam, is that you?
Oh, my gosh.
-What are you doing here?
-l'm just in town visiting friends.
-Where are they?
-Well, they're not here right now.
But what about you, Meg?
You were going to California.
I did. I came, I saw, I conquered.
Oh, and I met what's-his-name, something Michael Murray, at a bar.
-Who?
-lt doesn't matter.
Anyway, the whole scene got old.
So I'm living here for a while.
[CLEARS THROAT]
-You're from Chicago?
-No.
Massachusetts.
Andover.
Gosh, Sam, what are the odds we'd run into each other?
Yeah, I know. I thought I'd never see you again.
Well, I'm glad you were wrong.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Dude.
Cover your mouth.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Meg.
This is....
This is my brother, Dean.
-This is Dean?
-Yeah.
-So you've heard of me?
-Oh, yeah.
I've heard of you.
Nice, the way you treat your brother like luggage.
-Sorry?
-Let him do what he wants to do.
Stop dragging him over God's green earth.
Meg. lt's all right.
[whistles]
Okay.
Awkward.
I'm gonna get a drink now.
Sam, I'm sorry.
It's just the way you told me he treats you....
-lf it were me, I'd kill him.
-lt's all right.
He means well.
-We should hook up while you're in town.
-Yeah.
-Show you a hell of a time.
-That's great.
Why don't you--
Why don't you give me your number.
312-555-0143.
-You know, I never got your last name.
-Masters.
-Masters?
-So you better call.
Scout's honor.
I hope to see you around, Sam.
-Who the hell was she?
-l don't really know.
I only met her once.
Meeting up with her again....
I don't know, man, it's weird.
Well, what was she saying?
I treat you like luggage?
What, were you bitching about me to a chick?
I'm sorry.
It was when we had that fight when I was in that bus stop in Indiana. lt's not important.
Any truth to it?
Am I keeping you against your will?
No, of course not.
Now, would you listen?
What?
-There's something strange going on.
-Tell me about it.
-She wasn't that into me.
-No, man.
I mean our kind of strange.
Maybe even a lead.
-Why do you say that?
-l met Meg weeks ago on the side of the road.
Now I run into her in some Chicago bar?
The bar where a waitress was slaughtered by something supernatural.
-Think that's weird?
-Coincidence.
It happens.
Well, yeah, it happens.
But not to us.
I could be wrong, but there's something about her...
-...that I can't quite put my finger on.
-l bet you'd like to.
Maybe she's not a suspect.
You got a thing for her, huh?
Maybe you're thinking a little too much with the upstairs brain.
Huh?
Do me a favor.
Check if there's really a Meg Masters from Andover.
See if you can dig anything up...
-...on that symbol on Meredith's floor.
-What are you gonna do?
-l'm gonna watch Meg.
-You are.
-l wanna see what's what.
Better safe.
-You little pervert.
-Dude.
-l'm going, I'm going.
[PHONE ringing]

Looks like she was using that black altar to control the thing.
So Sammy's got a thing for the bad girl?
What's the deal with that bowl?

She was communicating.

-That the victims were from Lawrence?
MEG:
Doesn't mean anything.
-lt was just to draw you in.
-You killed those two people for nothing.
Baby, I've killed a lot more for a lot less.
DEAN:
You trapped us.
Good for you.
It's Miller time.
Why don't you kill us already?
Not very quick on the uptake, are we?
This trap isn't for you.
Dad.
It's a trap for Dad.
Well, sweetheart, you're dumber than you look.
Because even if Dad was in town, which he is not he wouldn't walk into this.
He's too good.
He is pretty good, I'll give you that.
But you see...
-...he has one weakness.
-What's that?
You.
He lets his guard down around his boys.
Lets his emotions cloud his judgments.
I happen to know he is in town.
And he'll come and try to save you.
And then the Daevas will kill everybody nice and slow and messy.
DEAN:
Well, I got news for you.
It's gonna take a lot more than some shadow to kill him.
MEG:
Oh, the Daevas are in the room here.
They're invisible.
Their shadows are the only part you can see.
SAM:
Why you doing this, Meg?
What kind of deal you got worked out here, huh?
-And with who?
-l'm doing this for the same reasons you do what you do.
Loyalty.
Love.
Like the love you have for Mommy.
-And Jess.
-Go to hell.
Baby, I'm already there.
Come on, Sam.
There's no need to be nasty.
I think we both know how you really feel about me.
You know I saw you watching me changing in my apartment.
It turned you on, didn't it?
-Get a room, you two.
-l didn't mind.
I liked that you were watching me.
Come on, Sammy.
You and I can still have a little dirty fun.
You wanna have fun?
Go ahead then.
I'm a little tied up right now.
[METAL clinking]
Now, were you just trying to distract me while your brother cuts free?
No.
It was because I have a knife of my own.
-Aah!
-Sam.
Get the altar.
Aah!
MEG:
No.
No.
No.
[screaming]
Yeah.
There.
So I guess the Daevas didn't like being bossed around.
I guess not.
-Hey, Sam?
-Hm?
Next time you wanna get laid find a girl that's not so buckets of crazy, huh?
Why didn't you just leave that stuff in the car?
I said it before and I'll say it again:
Better safe than sorry.
Hey.
-Dad?
-Hey, boys.
-Hi, Sam.
-Hey, Dad.
Dad, it was a trap.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I thought it might have been.
-Were you there?
JOHN:
Yeah.
I got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive.
She was the bad guy, right?
[IN unison]:
Yes, sir.
-Good.
Well, it doesn't surprise me.
It's tried to stop me before.
-The demon has?
JOHN:
It knows I'm close.
It knows I'm gonna kill it.
JOHN:
Not just exorcise it or send it back to hell.
Actually kill it.
How?
I'm working on that.
Well, let us come with you.
We'll help.
No, Sam.
Not yet.
Listen, try to understand this demon is a scary son of a bitch.
I don't want you in the crossfire.
I don't want you hurt.
-Dad, you don't have to worry about us.
JOHN:
Of course I do.
I'm your father.
Listen, Sammy, last time we were together we had one hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Too long.
[sniffs]
No!
[screaming]
Shut your eyes.
These things are shadow demons.
So let's light them up.
[coughing]
-Dad.
SAM:
Over here.
[GRUNTlNG]
All right.
Come on.
We don't have much time.
Soon as the flare's out, they'll be back.
No, wait.
Wait.
Sam, wait.
-Dad, you can't come with us.
-What?
What are you talking about?
-You boys....
You're beat to hell.
-We'll be all right.
Dean, we should stick together.
-We'll go after this demon together.
-Sam, listen to me.
We almost got Dad killed in there.
Don't you understand?
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
I mean, Meg was right.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
He's stronger without us around.
Dad.
No.
After everything.
After all the time we've spent looking for you....
Please.
-l gotta be a part of this fight.
-Sammy, this fight is just starting.
And we are all gonna have a part to play.
For now, you gotta trust me, son.
Okay?
You gotta let me go.
Be careful, boys.
Come on.
[ENGLISH SDH]
kristin:
hey, meredith, it's kristin.
you have to tell me what happened last night.
call me.
brad:
hey, meredith. brad calling.
listen, do you want to hook up later?
well, i'll talk to you then.
give me a call. thanks.
brock: hey, meredith, what's going on?
this is brock.
i just wanted to let you know the gang is gonna get together.
we're gonna go to the garage.
we're gonna have some beers and some shots.
all right, dean, this is the place.
i've got to say dad and me did just fine without these stupid costumes.
i feel like a high-school-drama dork.
what was that play that you did?
what was it -- "our town"?
yeah, you were good.
it was cute.
look, you want to pull this off or not?
i'm just saying these outfits cost hard-earned money.
whose?
ours. you think credit-card fraud is easy?
thanks for letting us look around.
the police said they were done with the place, so... you guys said you were with the alarm company?
that's right.
well, no offense, but your alarm is about as useful as boobs on a man.
well, that's why we're here -- to see what went wrong, to stop it from happening again.
now, ma'am, you found the body?
yeah.
right after it happened?
no, a few days later.
meredith's work called.
she hadn't showed up.
i knocked on her door.
that's when i noticed...
the smell.
any windows open?
any sign of break-in?
windows were locked.
front door was bolted.
chain was on the door.
we had to cut it to get in.
and the alarm was still on?
like i said. bang-up job your company is doing.
did you see any overturned furniture, broken glass, signs of struggle?
everything was in perfect condition... except meredith.
well, what condition was meredith in?
meredith was all over, in pieces.
the guy who killed her must have been a whack job.
but i tell you, if i didn't know any better, i'd have said a wild animal did it.
ma'am, you mind if we take some time, give this place a once-over?
go right ahead.
knock yourself out.
so the killer walks in and out of the apartment -- no weapons, no prints, nothing.
i'm telling you, the minute i found that article, i knew this was our kind of gig.
i think i agree with you.
so, you talked to the cops?
uh, yeah, i spoke to amy -- a, uh, charming, perky officer of the law.
what did you find out?
well, she's a sagittarius.
she loves tequila.
i mean...whew.
oh, and she's got this little tattoo. dean!
what?
yeah.
nothing we don't already know, except for one thing they're keeping out of the papers.
meredith's heart was missing.
her heart?
yeah, her heart.
so, what do you think did it to her?
the landlady said it looked like an animal attack.
maybe it was.
werewolf?
not a werewolf.
the lunar cycle's not right.
if it was a creature, it would've left some kind of trace.
it was probably a spirit.
hmm.
see if you can find any masking tape around.
ever see that symbol before?
never.
me, neither.
i talked to the bartender.
did you get anything...
besides her number?
dude, i'm a professional.
i'm offended that... all right.
you mind doing a little bit of thinking with your upstairs brain, dean?
hmm?
there's nothing to find out.
meredith worked here.
she waited tables.
everyone here is her friend.
everyone says she's normal.
she didn't do or say anything weird before she died.
what about that symbol?
did you find anything?
nope. nothing.
it wasn't in dad's journal or in any of the usual books.
i just have to dig a little deeper, i guess.
there was a first victim, right, before meredith?
right, yeah.
his name was, uh... his name was ben swardstrom.
last month he was found mutilated in his town house.
same deal. the door was locked.
the alarm was on.
is there any connection between them?
nothing i could tell.
ben was a banker.
meredith was a waitress.
they never met, never knew anyone in common.
they were practically from different worlds.
so the only successful intel we've scored is the bartender's phone number.
what?
sam?
meg.
sam!
sam, is that you?
oh, my gosh!
[ sighs ] what are you doing here?
i'm just in town -- visiting friends.
where are they?
well, they're not here right now, but what about you, meg?
i thought you were going to california.
oh, i did.
i came. i saw.
i conquered.
oh, and i met what's his name -- something michael murray -- at a bar.
who?
it doesn't matter.
anyway, the whole scene got old, so i'm living here for a while.
you're from chicago?
no, massachusetts -- andover.
gosh, sam, what are the odds we'd run into each other?
i know. i thought i'd never see you again.
well, i'm glad you were wrong.
dude, cover your mouth.
yeah, i'm sorry, meg.
this is, um -- this is my brother, dean.
this is dean?
yeah.
so you've heard of me?
oh, yeah, i've heard of you.
nice -- the way you treat your brother like luggage.
sorry?
why don't you let him do what he wants to do?
stop dragging him over god's green earth.
meg...it's all right.
[ whistles ] okay. awkward.
[ chuckles ] i'm gonna get a drink now.
sam, i'm sorry.
it's just, the way you told me he treats you, if it were me, i'd kill him.
it's all right.
he means well.
we should hook up while you're in town.
yeah.
i could show you a hell of a time.
that sounds great.
why don't you give me your number?
312-555-0143.
you know what?
i never got your last name.
masters.
masters?
so you better call.
scout's honor.
i hope to see you around, sam.
who the hell we he?
i don't really know.
i only met her once.
meeting up with her again?
i don't know, man.
it's weird.
what was she saying -- i treat you like luggage?
were you bitching about me to some chick?
look, i'm sorry, dean.
it was when we had that huge fight when i was in the bus stop in indiana.
is there any truth to what she's saying?
am i keeping you against your will, sam?
no, of course not.
now, would you listen?
what?
!
i think there's something strange going on here, dean.
tell me about it.
she wasn't even into me.
no, man, i mean, like our kind of strange.
maybe even a lead.
why do you say that?
i met meg weeks ago literally on the side of the road.
now i run into her in some random chicago bar -- the same bar where a waitress was slaughtered by something supernatural.
you don't think that's weird?
it happens.
well, yeah, it happens, but not to us.
look, i could be wrong.
i'm just saying there's something about this girl that i can't quite put my finger on.
but i bet you'd like to.
but maybe she's not a suspect.
maybe you got a thing for her, huh?
you're thinking too much with your upstairs brain, huh?
do me a favor.
check and see if there's a meg masters from massachusetts and see if you can't dig anything up on that symbol.
what are you gonna do?
i'm gonna watch meg.
[ laughs ] yeah.
i just want to see what's what.
all right, you little pervert.
i'm going. i'm going.
hey.
you're lurking outside that poor girl's apartment, aren't you?
no.
yes.
you've got a funny way of showing your affection.
you find anything on her or what?
there's a meg masters in the andover phone book.
i even pulled up her high-school photo.
now, look, why don't you go knock on her door and invite her to a poetry reading or whatever it is you do, huh?
what about the symbol?
any luck?
yeah, that i did have some luck with.
turns out it's zoroastrian.
very, very old-school, like 2,000 years before christ.
it's a sigil for a daeva.
what's a daeva?
it translates to "demon of darkness" -- zoroastrian demons, and they're savage, animalistic, nasty attitudes -- kind of like demonic pit bulls.
how did you figure that out?
you don't have a corner on paper chasing around here.
name the last book you read.
i called dad's friend caleb.
he told me, all right.
anyway, here's the thing.
these daevas, they have to be summoned.
so someone's controlling it?
yeah, that's what i'm saying.
and from what i gather, it's pretty risky business, too.
these suckers tend to bite the hand that feeds them... and the arms and the torsos.
what do they look like?
nobody's seen them for a couple of millennia.
summoning a demon that ancient, someone really knows their stuff.
i think we've got a major player in town.
why don't you go give that girl a private strip-o-gram?
bite me.
bite her.
don't leave teeth marks, though.
sam?
are you --
no, no, i'm just -- pervert!
what a creep!
i don't think you should come because the brothers -- they're in town.
i didn't know that --
yes, sir.
yes, i'll be here...
waiting for you.
what the hell?
dude, i've got to talk to you.
so, hot little meg is summoning the daeva?
it looks like she was using that black altar to control the thing.
so sammy's got a thing for the bad girl.
and what's the deal with that bowl again?
she was talking into it -- the way witches used to scry into crystal balls.
she was communicating with someone.
with the daeva?
no, you said those things were savages.
no, this was someone different, someone who's giving her orders, someone who's coming to that warehouse.
holy crap.
what?
what i was gonna tell you earlier.
i pulled a favor with my...
[ clears throat ] ...friend amy over at the police department.
complete records of the two victims.
we missed something the first time.
what?
the first victim -- the old man?
he spent his whole life in chicago, but look where he was born. lawrence, kansas.
mm-hmm.
meredith -- the second victim?
it turns out she was adopted.
and guess where she's from?
holy crap.
yeah.
i mean, that is where the demon killed mom.
you think meg's tied up with the demon?
i think it's a definite possibility.
what's the significance of lawrence?
and how do these daeva things fit in?
i say we trash that black altar, grab meg, and have ourselves a friendly little interrogation.
no, we can't.
we shouldn't tip her off.
we've got to stake out that warehouse.
we've got to see who...or what is showing up to meet her.
i'll tell you one thing.
i don't think we should do this alone.
we think we've got a serious lead on the thing that killed mom.
so, uh, this warehouse -- it's 1435 west erie.
dad, if you get this, get to chicago as soon as you can.
voice mail?
yeah.
jeez. what'd you get?
[ sighs ] i ransacked that trunk -- holy water, y weapon that i could think of.
exorcism rituals from about a half-dozen religions.
i'm not sure what to expect, so i guess we should just expect everything, huh?
it's a big night.
yeah.
you nervous?
no. no, are you?
no. no way.
god, could you imagine if we actually found that damn thing, that demon?
let's not get ahead of ourselves, all right?
i know. i'm just saying...
what if we did?
what if this whole thing was over tonight?
man, i'd sleep for a month, go back to school, just be a person again.
you want to go back to school?
yeah, once we're done hunting the thing.
why?
is there something wrong with that?
no, no, it's great.
good for you.
i mean, what are you gonna do when it's all over?
it's never gonna be over.
there's gonna be others.
there's always gonna be something to hunt.
but there's got to be something that you want for yourself.
i don't want you to leave the second this is over.
dude, what's your problem?
why do you think i drag you everywhere, huh?
why do you think i came and got you at stanford?
'cause dad was in trouble.
'cause you wanted to find the thing that killed mom.
yes, that, but it's more than that, man.
you and me and dad -- i want us to be together again.
i want us to be a family again.
dean, we are a family.
i'd do anything for you.
but things will never be the way they were before.
they could be.
i don't want them to be.
i'm not gonna live this life forever.
dean, when this is all over, you're gonna have to let me go my own way.
guys. hiding is a little bit childish, don't you think?
that didn't work out like i'd planned.
why don't you come out?
sam, i have to say, this puts a real crimp in our relationship.
yeah, tell me about it.
so, where's your little daeva friend?
around.
and that shotgun's not gonna do much good.
oh, don't worry, sweetheart.
the shotgun's not for the demon.
so, who is it, meg?
who's coming?
who are you waiting for?
you.
hey, sam, don't take this the wrong way, but your girlfriend...
is a bitch.
this, the whole thing, was a trap.
running into you at the bar, following you here, hearing what you had to say -- it was all a setup, wasn't it?
and that the victims were from lawrence.
it doesn't mean anything.
it was just to draw you in, that's all.
you killed those two people for nothing.
baby, i've killed a lot more for a lot less.
you trapped us.
good for you.
it's miller time.
why don't you kill us already?
not very quick on the uptake, are we?
this trap isn't for you.
dad.
it's a trap for dad.
oh, sweetheart, you're dumber than you look.
'cause even if dad was in town, which he is not, he wouldn't walk into something like this.
he's too good.
he is pretty good, i'll give you that.
but you see he has one weakness.
what's that?
you.
he lets his guard down around his boys, lets his emotions cloud his judgment.
i happen to know he is in town, and he'll come and try to save you.
and then the daevas will kill everybody -- nice and slow...
and messy.
well, i've got news for you.
it's gonna take a lot more than some...shadow to kill him.
oh, the daevas are in the room here.
they're invisible.
their shadows are just the only part you can see.
why are you doing this, meg?
what kind of deal you got worked out here, huh... and with who?
i'm doing this for the same reasons you do what you do -- loyalty, love.
like the love you had for mommy...and jess.go to he baby, i'm already there.
[ sighs ] come on, sam.
there's no need to be nasty.
i think we both know... how you really feel about me.
you know i saw you...
watching me... changing in my apartment.
it turned you on, didn't it?
get a room, you two.
i didn't mind.
i liked that you were watching me.
come on, sammy, you and i can still have a little dirty fun.
you want to have fun?
go ahead, then.
i'm a little tied up right now.
now, were you just trying to distract me while your brother cuts free?
no.
no.
it was because i have a knife of my own.
sam!
get the altar.
[ chuckles ] so, i guess the daevas didn't like being bossed around.
i guess not.
hey, sam?
hmm?
next time you want to get laid, find a girl that's not so buckets of crazy, huh?
why don't you just leave that stuff in the car?
i said it before, and i'll say it again -- better safe than sorry.
hey!
dad.
hey, boys.
hi, sam.
hi, dad.
dad, it was a trap.
i didn't know.
i'm sorry.
it's all right.
i thought it might have been.
were you there?
i got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive.
she was the bad guy, right?
yes, sir.yes, sir.
good. well, it doesn't surprise me.
it's tried to stop me before.
the demon has?
it knows i'm close.
it knows i'm gonna kill it.
not just exorcise it or send it back to hell, actually kill it.
how?
i'm working on that.
let us come with you.
we'll help.
no, sam.
not yet.
listen, try to understand.
this demon is a scary son of a bitch.
i don't want you caught in the crossfire.
i don't want you hurt.
you don't have to worry about us.
of course i do.
i'm your father.
listen, sammy, the last time we were together, we had one hell of a fight.
yes, sir.
it's good to see you again.
it's been a long time.
too long.
no!
these things are shadow demons, so let's light 'em up!
dad!
over here!
come on!
all right, come on.
we don't have much time.
as soon as the flare's out, they'll be back.
wait, wait!
sam, wait.
dad, you can't come with us.
what?
what are you talking about?
we'll be all right.
dean, we should stick together!
we'll go after those -- sam, listen to me!
we almost got dad killed in there.
don't you understand?
they're not gonna stop.
they're gonna try again.
they're gonna use us to get to him.
i mean, meg was right.
dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
he...he's stronger without us around.
dad... no.
after everything, after all the time we spent looking for you, please.
i've got to be a part of this fight.
sammy, this fight is just starting, and we are all gonna have a part to play.
for now, you've got to trust me, son.
okay?
you've got to let me go.
be careful, boys.
come on.
Kristin: hey, meredith, it's kristin.
You have to tell me what happened last night.
Call me.
Brad: hey, meredith.
Brad calling.

What are you doing here?
I'm just in town -
- Visiting friends.
Where are they?
Well, they're not here right now,
But what about you, meg?
I thought you were going to california.
Oh, i did.
I came.
I saw.
I conquered.
Oh, and i met what's his name --
Something michael murray -
- At a bar.
Who?
It doesn't matter.
Anyway, the whole scene got old,
So i'm living here for a while.
You're from chicago?
No, massachusetts -
- Andover.
Gosh, sam,
What are the odds we'd run into each other?
I know.
I thought i'd never see you again.
Well, i'm glad you were wrong.
Dude, cover your mouth.
Yeah, i'm sorry, meg.
This is, um -
- This is my brother, dean.
This is dean?
Yeah.
So you've heard of me?
Oh, yeah, i've heard of you.
Nice -
- The way you treat your brother like luggage.
Sorry?
Why don't you let him do what he wants to do?
Stop dragging him over god's green earth.
Meg...it's all right.
Okay.
Awkward.
I'm gonna get a drink now.
Sam, i'm sorry.
It's just, the way you told me he treats you,
If it were me, i'd kill him.
It's all right.
He means well.
We should hook up while you're in town.
Yeah.
I could show you a hell of a time.
That sounds great.
Why don't you give me your number?
312-555-0143.
You know what?
I never got your last name.
Masters.
Masters?
So you better call.
Scout's honor.
I hope to see you around, sam.
Who the hell we he?
I don't really know.
I only met her once.
Meeting up with her again?
I don't know, man.
It's weird.
What was she saying -- I treat you like luggage?
Were you bitching about me to some chick?
Look, i'm sorry, dean.
It was when we had that huge fight
When i was in the bus stop in indiana.
Is there any truth to what she's saying?
Am i keeping you against your will, sam?
No, of course not.
Now, would you listen?
What?
!
I think there's something strange going on here, dean.
Tell me about it.
She wasn't even into me.
No, man, i mean, like our kind of strange.
Maybe even a lead.
Why do you say that?
I met meg weeks ago literally on the side of the road.
Now i run into her in some random chicago bar --
The same bar where a waitress
Was slaughtered by something supernatural.
You don't think that's weird?
It happens.
Well, yeah, it happens, but not to us.
Look, i could be wrong.
I'm just saying there's something about this girl
That i can't quite put my finger on.
But i bet you'd like to.
But maybe she's not a suspect.
Maybe you got a thing for her, huh?
You're thinking too much with your upstairs brain, huh?
Do me a favor.
Check and see if there's a meg masters from massachusetts
And see if you can't dig anything up on that symbol.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna watch meg.
Yeah.
I just want to see what's what.
All right, you little pervert.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Hey.
You're lurking outside that poor girl's apartment,
Aren't you?
No.
Yes.
You've got a funny way of showing your affection.
You find anything on her or what?
There's a meg masters in the andover phone book.
I even pulled up her high-School photo.
Now, look, why don't you go knock on her door
And invite her to a poetry reading
Or whatever it is you do, huh?
What about the symbol?
Any luck?
Yeah, that i did have some luck with.
Turns out it's zoroastrian.
Very, very old-School, like 2,000 years before christ.
It's a sigil for a daeva.
What's a daeva?
It translates to "demon of darkness" --
Zoroastrian demons, and they're savage, animalistic,
Nasty attitudes -
- Kind of like demonic pit bulls.
How did you figure that out?
You don't have a corner on paper chasing around here.
Name the last book you read.
I called dad's friend caleb.
He told me, all right.
Anyway, here's the thing.
These daevas, they have to be summoned.
So someone's controlling it?
Yeah, that's what i'm saying.
And from what i gather, it's pretty risky business, too.
These suckers tend to bite the hand that feeds them...
And the arms and the torsos.
What do they look like?
Nobody's seen them for a couple of millennia.
Summoning a demon that ancient,
Someone really knows their stuff.
I think we've got a major player in town.
Why don't you go give that girl a private strip-O-Gram?
Bite me.
Bite her.
Don't leave teeth marks, though.
Sam?
Are you --
No, no, i'm just --
Pervert!
What a creep!
I don't think you should come
Because the brothers -
- They're in town.
I didn't know that --
Yes, sir.
Yes, i'll be here... waiting for you.
What the hell?
Dude, i've got to talk to you.
So, hot little meg is summoning the daeva?
It looks like she was using that black altar
To control the thing.
So sammy's got a thing for the bad girl.
And what's the deal with that bowl again?
She was talking into it --
The way witches used to scry into crystal balls.
She was communicating with someone.
With the daeva?
No, you said those things were savages.
No, this was someone different,
Someone who's giving her orders,
Someone who's coming to that warehouse.
Holy crap.
What?
What i was gonna tell you earlier.
I pulled a favor with my
Friend amy over at the police department.
Complete records of the two victims.
We missed something the first time.
What?
The first victim -
- The old man?
He spent his whole life in chicago,
But look where he was born.
Lawrence, kansas.
Mm-Hmm.
Meredith -
- The second victim?
It turns out she was adopted.
And guess where she's from?
Holy crap.
Yeah.
I mean, that is where the demon killed mom.
You think meg's tied up with the demon?
I think it's a definite possibility.
What's the significance of lawrence?
And how do these daeva things fit in?
I say we trash that black altar, grab meg,
And have ourselves a friendly little interrogation.
No, we can't.
We shouldn't tip her off.
We've got to stake out that warehouse.
We've got to see who...or what is showing up to meet her.
I'll tell you one thing.
I don't think we should do this alone.
We think we've got a serious lead
On the thing that killed mom.
So, uh, this warehouse -
- It's 1435 west erie.
Dad, if you get this,
Get to chicago as soon as you can.
Voice mail?
Yeah.
Jeez.
What'd you get?
I ransacked that trunk --
Holy water, y weapon that i could think of.
Exorcism rituals from about a half-Dozen religions.
I'm not sure what to expect,
So i guess we should just expect everything, huh?
It's a big night.
Yeah.
You nervous?
No.
No, are you?
No.
No way.
God, could you imagine if we actually
Found that damn thing, that demon?
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, all right?
I know.
I'm just saying... what if we did?
What if this whole thing was over tonight?
Man, i'd sleep for a month,
Go back to school, just be a person again.
You want to go back to school?
Yeah, once we're done hunting the thing.
Why?
Is there something wrong with that?
No, no, it's great.
Good for you.
I mean, what are you gonna do when it's all over?
It's never gonna be over.
There's gonna be others.
There's always gonna be something to hunt.
But there's got to be something that you want for yourself.
I don't want you to leave the second this is over.
Dude, what's your problem?
Why do you think i drag you everywhere, huh?
Why do you think i came and got you at stanford?
'Cause dad was in trouble.
'Cause you wanted to find the thing that killed mom.
Yes, that, but it's more than that, man.
You and me and dad --
I want us to be together again.
I want us to be a family again.
Dean, we are a family.
I'd do anything for you.
But things will never be the way they were before.
They could be.
I don't want them to be.
I'm not gonna live this life forever.
Dean, when this is all over,
You're gonna have to let me go my own way.
Guys.
Hiding is a little bit childish, don't you think?
That didn't work out like i'd planned.
Why don't you come out?
Sam, i have to say,
This puts a real crimp in our relationship.
Yeah, tell me about it.
So, where's your little daeva friend?
Around.
And that shotgun's not gonna do much good.
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.
The shotgun's not for the demon.
So, who is it, meg?
Who's coming?
Who are you waiting for?
You.
Hey, sam, don't take this the wrong way,
But your girlfriend... is a bitch.
This, the whole thing, was a trap.
Running into you at the bar,
Following you here, hearing what you had to say --
It was all a setup, wasn't it?
And that the victims were from lawrence.
It doesn't mean anything.
It was just to draw you in, that's all.
You killed those two people for nothing.
Baby, i've killed a lot more for a lot less.
You trapped us.
Good for you.
It's miller time.
Why don't you kill us already?
Not very quick on the uptake, are we?
This trap isn't for you.
Dad.
It's a trap for dad.
Oh, sweetheart, you're dumber than you look.
'Cause even if dad was in town, which he is not,
He wouldn't walk into something like this.
He's too good.
He is pretty good, i'll give you that.
But you see
He has one weakness.
What's that?
You.
He lets his guard down around his boys,
Lets his emotions cloud his judgment.
I happen to know he is in town,
And he'll come and try to save you.
And then the daevas will kill everybody --
Nice and slow... and messy.
Well, i've got news for you.
It's gonna take a lot more than some...shadow to kill him.
Oh, the daevas are in the room here.
They're invisible.
Their shadows are just the only part you can see.
Why are you doing this, meg?
What kind of deal you got worked out here, huh...
And with who?
I'm doing this for the same reasons
You do what you do --
Loyalty, love.
Like the love you had for mommy...and jess.Go to he
Baby, i'm already there.
Come on, sam.
There's no need to be nasty.
I think we both know...
How you really feel about me.
You know
I saw you... watching me...
Changing in my apartment.
It turned you on, didn't it?
Get a room, you two.
I didn't mind.
I liked that you were watching me.
Come on, sammy,
You and i can still have a little dirty fun.
You want to have fun?
Go ahead, then.
I'm a little tied up right now.
Now, were you just trying to distract me
While your brother cuts free?
No.
No.
It was because i have a knife of my own.
Sam!
Get the altar.
So, i guess the daevas
Didn't like being bossed around.
I guess not.
Hey, sam?
Hmm?
Next time you want to get laid,
Find a girl that's not so buckets of crazy, huh?
Why don't you just leave that stuff in the car?
I said it before, and i'll say it again --
Better safe than sorry.
Hey!
Dad.
Hey, boys.
Hi, sam.
Hi, dad.
Dad, it was a trap.
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I thought it might have been.
Were you there?
I got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive.
She was the bad guy, right?
Yes, sir.Yes, sir.
Good.
Well, it doesn't surprise me.
It's tried to stop me before.
The demon has?
It knows i'm close.
It knows i'm gonna kill it.
Not just exorcise it or send it back to hell,
Actually kill it.
How?
I'm working on that.
Let us come with you.
We'll help.
No, sam.
Not yet.
Listen, try to understand.
This demon is a scary son of a bitch.
I don't want you caught in the crossfire.
I don't want you hurt.
You don't have to worry about us.
Of course i do.
I'm your father.
Listen, sammy, the last time we were together,
We had one hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Too long.
No!
These things are shadow demons,
So let's light 'em up!
Dad!
Over here!
Come on!
All right, come on.
We don't have much time.
As soon as the flare's out, they'll be back.
Wait, wait!
Sam, wait.
Dad, you can't come with us.
What?
What are you talking about?
We'll be all right.
Dean, we should stick together!
We'll go after those --
Sam, listen to me!
We almost got dad killed in there.
Don't you understand?
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
I mean, meg was right.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
He...he's stronger without us around.
Dad...
No.
After everything,
After all the time we spent looking for you,
Please.
I've got to be a part of this fight.
Sammy, this fight is just starting,
And we are all gonna have a part to play.
For now, you've got to trust me, son.
Okay?
You've got to let me go.
Be careful, boys.
Come on.
Hey, Meredith, it's Kristin.
You have to tell me what happened last night.
Call me.
Hey, Meredith.
Brad calling.
Listen, do you want to hook up later?
Well, I'll talk to you then.
Give me a call.
Thanks.
Hey, Meredith, don't say I don't got your back.
I just wanted to let you know the gang is gonna get together.
We're gonna go to the garage.
We're gonna have some beers and some shots.
All right, Dean, this is the place.
I've got to say dad and me did just fine
Without these stupid costumes.
I feel like a highschool-drama dork.
What was that play that you did?
What was it -- "Our town"?
Yeah, you were good.
It was cute.
Look, you want to pull this off or not?
I'm just saying these outfits cost hard-earned money.
Whose?
Ours.
You think credit-card fraud is easy?
Thanks for letting us look around.
The police said they were done with the place, so...
You guys said you were with the alarm company?
That's right.
Well, no offense,
But your alarm is about as useful as boobs on a man.
Well, that's why we're here --
To see what went wrong, to stop it from happening again.
Now, ma'am, you found the body?
Yeah.
Right after it happened?
No, a few days later.
Meredith's work called.
She hadn't showed up.
I knocked on her door.
That's when I noticed... the smell.
Any windows open?
Any sign of break-In?
Windows were locked.
Front door was bolted.
Chain was on the door.
We had to cut it to get in.
And the alarm was still on?
Like I said.
Bang-Up job your company is doing.
Did you see any overturned furniture,
Broken glass, signs of struggle?
Everything was in perfect condition...
Except Meredith.
Well, what condition was Meredith in?
Meredith was all over, in pieces.
The guy who killed her must have been a whack job.
But I tell you, if I didn't know any better,
I'd have said a wild animal did it.
Ma'am, you mind if we take some time,
Give this place a once-over?
Go right ahead.
Knock yourself out.
So the killer walks in and out of the apartment --
No weapons, no prints, nothing.
I'm telling you, the minute I found that article,
I knew this was our kind of gig.
I think I agree with you.
So, you talked to the cops?
Uh, yeah, I spoke to Amy --
A, uh, charming, perky officer of the law.
What did you find out?
Well, she's a sagittarius.
She loves tequila.
I mean...whew.
Oh, and she's got this little tattoo.
Dean!
What?
Yeah.
Nothing we don't already know,
Except for one thing they're keeping out of the papers.
Meredith's heart was missing.
Her heart?
Yeah, her heart.
So, what do you think did it to her?
The landlady said it looked like an animal attack.
Maybe it was.
Werewolf?
Not a werewolf.
The lunar cycle's not right.
If it was a creature,
It would've left some kind of trace.
It was probably a spirit.
Hmm.
See if you can find any masking tape around.
Ever see that symbol before?
Never.
Me, neither.
I talked to the bartender.
Did you get anything...
besides her number?
Dude, I'm a professional.
I'm offended that...
All right.
You mind doing a little bit of thinking
With your upstairs brain, Dean?
Hmm?
There's nothing to find out.
Meredith worked here.
She waited tables.
Everyone here is her friend.
Everyone says she's normal.
She didn't do or say anything weird before she died.
What about that symbol?
Did you find anything?
Nope.
Nothing.
It wasn't in dad's journal or in any of the usual books.
I just have to dig a little deeper, I guess.
There was a first victim, right, before Meredith?
Right, yeah.
His name was, uh...
His name was Ben Swardstrom.
Last month he was found mutilated in his town house.
Same deal.
The door was locked.
The alarm was on.
Is there any connection between them?
Nothing I could tell.
Ben was a banker.
Meredith was a waitress.
They never met, never knew anyone in common.
They were practically from different worlds.
So the only successful intel we've scored
Is the bartender's phone number.
What?
Sam?
Meg.
Sam!
Sam, is that you?
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing here?
I'm just in town -
- Visiting friends.
Where are they?
Well, they're not here right now,
But what about you, Meg?
I thought you were going to California.
Oh, I did.
I came.
I saw.
I conquered.
Oh, and I met what's his name --
Something Michael Murray -
- At a bar.
Who?
It doesn't matter.
Anyway, the whole scene got old,
So I'm living here for a while.
You're from Chicago?
No, Massachusetts -
- Andover.
Gosh, Sam,
What are the odds we'd run into each other?
I know.
I thought I'd never see you again.
Well, I'm glad you were wrong.
Dude, cover your mouth.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Meg.
This is, um -
- This is my brother, Dean.
This is Dean?
Yeah.
So you've heard of me?
Oh, yeah, I've heard of you.
Nice -
- The way you treat your brother like luggage.
Sorry?
Why don't you let him do what he wants to do?
Stop dragging him over god's green earth.
Meg...it's all right.
Okay.
Awkward.
I'm gonna get a drink now.
Sam, I'm sorry.
It's just, the way you told me he treats you,
If it were me, I'd kill him.
It's all right.
He means well.
We should hook up while you're in town.
Yeah.
I could show you a hell of a time.
That sounds great.
Why don't you give me your number?
312-555-0143.
You know what?
I never got your last name.
Masters.
Masters?
So you better call.
Scout's honor.
I hope to see you around, Sam.
Who the hell we he?
I don't really know.
I only met her once.
Meeting up with her again?
I don't know, man.
It's weird.
What was she saying -- I treat you like luggage?
Were you bitching about me to some chick?
Look, I'm sorry, Dean.
It was when we had that huge fight
When I was in the bus stop in Indiana.
Is there any truth to what she's saying?
Am I keeping you against your will, Sam?
No, of course not.
Now, would you listen?
What?
!
I think there's something strange going on here, Dean.
Tell me about it.
She wasn't even into me.
No, man, I mean, like our kind of strange.

Well, yeah, it happens, but not to us.
Look, I could be wrong.

But I bet you'd like to.
But maybe she's not a suspect.
Maybe you got a thing for her, huh?
You're thinking too much with your upstairs brain, huh?
Do me a favor.
Check and see if there's a Meg Masters from Massachusetts
And see if you can't dig anything up on that symbol.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna watch Meg.
Yeah.
I just want to see what's what.
All right, you little pervert.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Hey.
You're lurking outside that poor girl's apartment,
Aren't you?
No.
Yes.
You've got a funny way of showing your affection.

So, where's your little Daeva friend?
Around.
And that shotgun's not gonna do much good.
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.
The shotgun's not for the demon.
So, who is it, Meg?
Who's coming?
Who are you waiting for?
You.
Hey, Sam, don't take this the wrong way,
But your girlfriend... is a bitch.
This, the whole thing, was a trap.
Running into you at the bar,
Following you here, hearing what you had to say --
It was all a setup, wasn't it?
And that the victims were from Lawrence.
It doesn't mean anything.
It was just to draw you in, that's all.
You killed those two people for nothing.
Baby, I've killed a lot more for a lot less.
You trapped us.
Good for you.
It's miller time.
Why don't you kill us already?
Not very quick on the uptake, are we?
This trap isn't for you.
Dad.
It's a trap for dad.
Oh, sweetheart, you're dumber than you look.
'Cause even if dad was in town, which he is not,
He wouldn't walk into something like this.
He's too good.
He is pretty good, I'll give you that.
But you see
He has one weakness.
What's that?
You.
He lets his guard down around his boys,
Lets his emotions cloud his judgment.
I happen to know he is in town,
And he'll come and try to save you.
And then the Daevas will kill everybody --
Nice and slow... and messy.
Well, I've got news for you.
It's gonna take a lot more than some...shadow to kill him.
Oh, the Daevas are in the room here.
They're invisible.
Their shadows are just the only part you can see.
Why are you doing this, Meg?
What kind of deal you got worked out here, huh...
And with who?
I'm doing this for the same reasons
You do what you do --
Loyalty, love.
Like the love you had for mommy...and Jess.
Go to hell
Baby, I'm already there.
Come on, Sam.
There's no need to be nasty.
I think we both know...
How you really feel about me.
You know
I saw you... watching me...
Changing in my apartment.
It turned you on, didn't it?
Get a room, you two.
I didn't mind.
I liked that you were watching me.
Come on, Sammy,
You and I can still have a little dirty fun.
You want to have fun?
Go ahead, then.
I'm a little tied up right now.
Now, were you just trying to distract me
While your brother cuts free?
No.
No.
It was because I have a knife of my own.
Sam!
Get the altar.
So, I guess the Daevas
Didn't like being bossed around.
I guess not.
Hey, Sam?
Hmm?
Next time you want to get laid,
Find a girl that's not so buckets of crazy, huh?
Why don't you just leave that stuff in the car?
I said it before, and I'll say it again --
Better safe than sorry.
Hey!
Dad.
Hey, boys.
Hi, Sam.
Hi, dad.
Dad, it was a trap.
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I thought it might have been.
Were you there?
I got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive.
She was the bad guy, right?
Yes, sir.Yes, sir.
Good.
Well, it doesn't surprise me.
It's tried to stop me before.
The demon has?
It knows I'm close.
It knows I'm gonna kill it.
Not just exorcise it or send it back to hell,
Actually kill it.
How?
I'm working on that.
Let us come with you.
We'll help.
No, Sam.
Not yet.
Listen, try to understand.
This demon is a scary son of a bitch.
I don't want you caught in the crossfire.
I don't want you hurt.
You don't have to worry about us.
Of course I do.
I'm your father.
Listen, Sammy, the last time we were together,
We had one hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Too long.
No!
These things are shadow demons,
So let's light 'em up!
Dad!
Over here!
Come on!
All right, come on.
We don't have much time.
As soon as the flare's out, they'll be back.
Wait, wait!
Sam, wait.
Dad, you can't come with us.
What?
What are you talking about?
We'll be all right.
Dean, we should stick together!
We'll go after those --
Sam, listen to me!
We almost got dad killed in there.
Don't you understand?
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
I mean, Meg was right.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
He...he's stronger without us around.
Dad...
No.
After everything,
After all the time we spent looking for you,
Please.
I've got to be a part of this fight.
Sammy, this fight is just starting,
And we are all gonna have a part to play.
For now, you've got to trust me, son.
Okay?
You've got to let me go.
Be careful, boys.
Come on.
Great.
Meredith.
Meredith.
Hello?
Meredith.
Meredith.
System disarmed.
System armed.
Hey, Meredith, it's Kristin.
You have to tell me what happened last night.
Call me.
Hey Meredith, it's Dereck.
Where have you been?
I've tried to get you all day 'cause I got maybe something's gonna please you.
Guess what.
Call me when you come back, ok?
So if you wanna solve that mystery, call me.
Alright.
Bye.
Hey, Meredith.
Listen,
All right, Dean, this is the place.
I've got to say dad and me did just fine without these stupid costumes.
I feel like a high-school-drama dork.
What was that play that you did?
What was it... "Our Town".
Yeah, you were good.
It was cute.
Look, you want to pull this off or not?
I'm just saying these outfits cost hard-earned money.
- Whose?
- Ours.
You think credit-card fraud is easy?
Thanks for letting us look around.
The police said they were done with the place, so...
You guys said you were with the alarm company?
That's right.
Well, no offense, but your alarm is about as useful as boobs on a man.
Well, that's why we're here, to see what went wrong, to stop it from happening again.
Now, ma'am, you found the body?
Yeah.
Right after it happened?
No, a few days later.
Meredith's work called.
She hadn't showed up.
I knocked on her door.
That's when I noticed... the smell.
Any windows open?
Any sign of break-in?
Windows were locked.
Front door was bolted.
Chain was on the door.
We had to cut it to get in.
And the alarm was still on?
Like I said.
Bang-up job your company is doing.
Did you see any overturned furniture, broken glass, signs of struggle?
Everything was in perfect condition... except Meredith.
Well, what condition was Meredith in?
Meredith was all over, in pieces.
The guy who killed her must have been a whack job.
But I tell you, if I didn't know any better,
I'd have said a wild animal did it.
Ma'am, you mind if we take some time, give this place a once-over?
Go right ahead.
Knock yourself out.
So the killer walks in and out of the apartment...
- no weapons, no prints, nothing.
- I'm telling you, the minute I found that article, I knew this was our kind of gig.
I think I agree with you.
So, you talked to the cops?
Uh, yeah, I spoke to Amy... a, uh, charming, perky officer of the law.
- What did you find out?
- Well, she's a sagittarius.
She loves tequila.
I mean...
Oh, and she's got this little tattoo.
- Dean!
- What?
Yeah.
Nothing we don't already know, except for one thing they're keeping out of the papers.
Meredith's heart was missing.
Her heart?
Yeah, her heart.
So, what do you think did it to her?
The landlady said it looked like an animal attack.
Maybe it was.
- Werewolf?
- Not a werewolf.
The lunar cycle's not right.
Plus, if it was a creature, it would've left some kind of trace.
It was probably a spirit.
See if you can find any masking tape around.
Ever see that symbol before?
Never.
Me, neither.
I want to step on your hands and cut the rope and the twine tangled up on your mind, love
On the outside.
On the hillside.
We can play with the paste all night.
I talked to the bartender.
Did you get anything... besides her number?
Dude,
I'm a professional.
I'm offended that... you would think that.
All right.
You mind doing a little bit of thinking with your upstairs brain, Dean?
Hmm?
There's nothing to find out.
Meredith worked here.
She waited tables.
Everyone here is her friends.
Everyone says she's normal.
She didn't do or say anything weird before she died.
So...
What about that symbol?
Did you find anything?
Nope.
Nothing.
It wasn't in dad's journal or in any of the usual books.
I just have to dig a little deeper, I guess.
There was a first victim, right, before Meredith?
Right, yeah.
His name was, uh... his name was Ben Swardstrom.
Last month he was found mutilated in his town house.
Same deal.
The door was locked.
The alarm was on.
- Is there any connection between them?
- Nothing I could tell.
I mean not yet, at least.
Ben was a banker.
Meredith was a waitress.
They never met, never knew anyone in common.
They were practically from different worlds.
So, to recap, the only successful intel we've scored so far is the bartender's phone number.
What?
Sam!
Well, we talked about you and we've heard about you...
Meg.
Sam!
Sam, is that you?
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing here?
I'm just in town... visiting friends.
Where are they?
Well, they're not here right now, but what about you, Meg?
I thought you were going to California.
I did.
I came.
I saw.
I conquered.
Oh, and I met what's his name... something Michael Murray, at a bar.
Who?
It doesn't matter.
Anyway, the whole scene got old, so I'm living here for a while.
- You're from Chicago?
- No, Massachusetts.
Andover.
Gosh, Sam, what are the odds we'd run into each other?
I know.
I thought I'd never see you again.
Well, I'm glad you were wrong.
Dude, cover your mouth.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Meg.
This is, um...
This is my brother, Dean.
- This is Dean?
- Yeah.
So you've heard of me?
Oh, yeah, I've heard of you.
Nice, the way you treat your brother like luggage.
- Sorry?
- Why don't you let him do what he wants to do?
Stop dragging him over god's green earth.
Meg... it's all right.
Okay.
Awkward.
I'm gonna get a drink now.
Sam, I'm sorry.
It's just, the way you told me he treats you,
- if it were me, I'd kill him.
- It's all right.
He means well.
- We should hook up while you're in town.
- Yeah.
- I could show you a hell of a time.
- That sounds great.
Why don't you give me your number?
312-555-0143.
You know what?
I never got your last name.
- Masters.
- Masters?
So you better call.
Scout's honor.
I hope to see you around, Sam.
Who the hell was she?
I don't really know.
I only met her once.
Meeting up with her again?
I don't know, man.
It's weird.
What was she saying...
I treat you like luggage?
Were you bitching about me to some chick?
Look, I'm sorry, Dean.
It was when we had that huge fight when I was in the bus stop in Indiana.
But that's not important.
Is there any truth to what she's saying?
Am I keeping you against your will, Sam?
No, of course not.
Now, would you listen?
What?
!
I think there's something strange going on here, Dean.
Tell me about it.
She wasn't even into me.
No, man, I mean, like our kind of strange.
- Like maybe even a lead.
- Why do you say that?
I met Meg weeks ago literally on the side of the road.
Now I run into her in some random Chicago bar... the same bar where a waitress was slaughtered by something supernatural.
You don't think that's a little weird?
I don't know, random coincidence, it happens.
Well, yeah, it happens, but not to us.
Look, I could be wrong.
I'm just saying that there's something about this girl that I can't quite put my finger on.
But I bet you'd like to.
But maybe she's not a suspect.
Maybe you got a thing for her, huh?
Maybe you're thinking too much with your upstairs brain, huh?
Do me a favor.
Check and see if there's really a Meg Masters from Andover, Massachusetts and see if you can't dig anything up on that symbol on Meredith's floor.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna watch Meg.
I just want to see what's what.
Better safe than sorry.
All right, you little pervert.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Hey.
Let me guess.
You're lurking outside that poor girl's apartment, aren't you?
No.
Yes.
You've got a funny way of showing your affection.
You find anything on her or what?
Sorry man, I should check this out.
There's a Meg Masters in the Andover phone book.
I even pulled up her high-school photo.
Now, look, why don't you go knock on her door and invite her to a poetry reading or whatever it is you do.
What about the symbol?
Any luck?
Yeah, that I did have some luck with.
Turns out it's zoroastrian.
Very, very old-school, like 2,000 years before Christ.
It's a sigil for a Daeva.
- What's a Daeva?
- It translates to "demon of darkness"... zoroastrian demons, and they're savage, animalistic, nasty attitudes;
kind of like demonic pit bulls.
- How did you figure that out?
- Give me some credit, man.
You don't have a corner on paper chasing around here.
Name the last book you read.
I called dad's friend, Caleb.
He told me, all right.
Anyway, here's the thing.
These Daevas, they have to be summoned.
Conjured.
So someone's controlling it?
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
And from what I gather, it's pretty risky business, too.
These suckers tend to bite the hand that feeds them... and the arm and the torsos.
- So what do they look like?
- Nobody knows.
Nobody's seen them for a couple of millennia.
Summoning a demon that ancient, someone really knows their stuff.
I think we've got a major player in town.
Why don't you go give that girl a private strip-o-gram?
- Bite me.
- Bite her.
Don't leave teeth marks, though.
It's not...
Sam?
- No, no, I'm just...
- Pervert!
I don't think you should come because the brothers, they're in town.
I didn't know that...
Yes, sir.
Yes, I'll be here... waiting for you.
What the hell?
Dude, I've got to talk to you.
So, hot little Meg is summoning the Daeva?
It looks like she was using that black altar to control the thing.
So Sammy's got a thing for the bad girl.
- And what's the deal with that bowl again?
- She was talking into it... the way witches used to scry into crystal balls or animal entrails.
She was communicating with someone.
- With who?
With the Daeva?
- No, you said those things were savages.
No, this was someone different, someone who's giving her orders, someone who's coming to that warehouse.
Holy crap.
What?
What I was gonna tell you earlier.
I pulled a favor with my... friend Amy, over at the police department.
The complete records of the two victims.
We missed something the first time.
What?
The first victim, the old man?
He spent his whole life in Chicago, but he wasn't born here.
Look where he was born.
Lawrence, Kansas.
Meredith, the second victim?
It turns out she was adopted.
And guess where she's from?
Holy crap.
Yeah.
I mean, that is where the demon killed mom.
That's where everything started.
You think Meg's tied up with the demon?
I think it's a definite possibility.
But I don't understand!
What's the significance of Lawrence?
And how do these Daeva things fit in?
I say we trash that black altar, grab Meg, and have ourselves a friendly little interrogation.
No, we can't.
We shouldn't tip her off.
We've got to stake out that warehouse.
We've got to see who... or what, is showing up to meet her.
I'll tell you one thing.
I don't think we should do this alone.
We think we've got a serious lead on the thing that killed mom.
So, uh, this warehouse... it's
1435 west erie.
Dad, if you get this, get to Chicago as soon as you can.
Voice mail?
Yeah.
Jeez.
What'd you get?
I ransacked that trunk... holy water, every weapon that I could think of.
Exorcism rituals from about a half-dozen religions.
I'm not sure what to expect, so I guess we should just expect everything, huh?
It's a big night.
Yeah.
You nervous?
No.
Are you?
No.
No way.
God, could you imagine if we actually found that damn thing, that demon?
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, all right?
I know.
I'm just saying... what if we did?
What if this whole thing was over tonight?
Man, I'd sleep for a month, go back to school, just be a person again.
- You want to go back to school?
- Yeah, once we're done hunting the thing.
Huh.
Why?
Is there something wrong with that?
No, no, it's great.
Good for you.
I mean,
- what are you gonna do when it's all over?
- It's never gonna be over.
There's gonna be others.
There's always gonna be something to hunt.
But there's got to be something that you want for yourself.
Yeah, I don't want you to leave the second this is over, Sam.
Dude, what's your problem?
Why do you think I drag you everywhere?
Why do you think I came and got you at Stanford in the first place?
'Cause dad was in trouble.
'Cause you wanted to find the thing that killed mom.
Yes, that, but it's more than that, man.
You and me and dad...
I want us to... to be together again.
I want us to be a family again.
Dean, we are a family.
I'd do anything for you.
But things will never be the way they were before.
They could be.
I don't want them to be.
I'm not gonna live this life forever.
Dean, when this is all over, you're gonna have to let me go my own way.
Guys.
Hiding is a little bit childish, don't you think?
That didn't work out like I'd planned.
Why don't you come out?
Sam,
I have to say, this puts a real crimp in our relationship.
Yeah, tell me about it.
So, where's your little Daeva friend?
Around.
And that shotgun's not gonna do much good.
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.
The shotgun's not for the demon.
So, who is it, Meg?
Who's coming?
Who are you waiting for?
You.
Hey, Sam, don't take this the wrong way, but your girlfriend... is a bitch.
This, the whole thing, was a trap.
Running into you at the bar, following you here, hearing what you had to say... it was all a set up, wasn't it?
And that the victims were from Lawrence.
It doesn't mean anything.
It was just to draw you in, that's all.
- You killed those two people for nothing.
- Baby, I've killed a lot more for a lot less.
You trapped us.
Good for you.
It's miller time.
Why don't you kill us already?
Not very quick on the up take, are we?
This trap isn't for you.
Dad.
It's a trap for dad.
Oh, sweetheart, you're dumber than you look.
'Cause even if dad was in town, which he is not, he wouldn't walk into something like this.
He's too good.
He is pretty good, I'll give you that.
But you see... he has one weakness.
What's that?

I happen to know he is in town, and he'll come and try to save you.
And then the Daevas will kill everybody... nice and slow... and messy.
Well, I've got news for you.
It's gonna take a lot more than some... shadow to kill him.
Oh, the Daevas are in the room here.
They're invisible.
Their shadows are just the only part you can see.
Why are you doing this, Meg?
What kind of deal you got worked out here, huh...
- and with who?
- I'm doing this for the same reasons you do what you do.
Loyalty, love.
Like the love you had for mommy... and Jess.
Go to hell.
Baby, I'm already there.
Come on, Sam.
There's no need to be nasty.
I think we both know... how you really feel about me.
You know...
I saw you... watching me... changing in my apartment.
It turned you on, didn't it?
- Get a room, you two.
- I didn't mind.
I liked that you were watching me.
Come on, Sammy, you and I can still have a little dirty fun.
You want to have fun?
Go ahead, then.
I'm a little tied up right now.
Now, were you just trying to distract me while your brother cuts free?
No.
No.
It was because I have a knife of my own.
Sam!
Get the altar!
So, I guess the Daevas didn't like being bossed around.
I guess not.
Hey, Sam?
The next time you want to get laid, find a girl that's not so buckets of crazy, huh?
Why don't you just leave that stuff in the car?
I said it before, and I'll say it again... better safe than sorry.
Hey!
Dad.
Hey, boys.
Hi, Sam.
Hi, dad.
Dad, it was a trap.
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I thought it might have been.
Were you there?
I got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive.
She was the bad guy, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
Well, it doesn't surprise me.
It's tried to stop me before.
- The demon has?
- It knows I'm close.
It knows I'm gonna kill it.
Not just exorcise it or send it back to Hell, actually kill it.
How?
I'm working on that.
Let us come with you.
We'll help.
No, Sam.
Not yet.
Listen, try to understand.
This demon is a scary son of a bitch.
I don't want you caught in the crossfire.
- I don't want you hurt.
- You don't have to worry about us.
Of course I do.
I'm your father.
Listen, Sammy, the last time we were together, we had one hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Too long.
No!
Shot your ass!
These things are shadow demons, so let's light 'em up!
Dad!
Over here!
Come on!
All right, come on.
We don't have much time.
As soon as the flare's out, they'll be back.
Wait, wait!
Sam, wait.
- Dad, you can't come with us.
- What?
What are you talking about?
You boys...
- you're beat to hell.
- We'll be all right.
Dean, we should stick together!
- We'll go after those...
- Sam, listen to me!
We almost got dad killed in there.
Don't you understand?
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.
I mean, Meg was right.
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.
He... he's stronger without us around.
Dad... no.
After everything, after all the time we spent looking for you, please.
- I've got to be a part of this fight.
- Sammy, this fight is just starting, and we are all gonna have a part to play.
For now, you've got to trust me, son.
Okay?
You've got to let me go.
Be careful, boys.
Come on.
Make it stop!
...stop!
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
This mattress isn't big enough for the 3 of us.
I know.
When's the furniture coming?
It's coming tomorrow.
Mommy,is it a school day?
Indeed it is.
I want my red dress,momm
I know you do,honey.
And tomorrow when the truck arrives-
What?
- My waffle shirt.
- It's coming.
You sent it on the truck?
Most of the things we shipped.
I gave you one child.
I carrying another, presumably yours.
So don't take that attitude.
Mommy,i want my red dress.
I don't believe i was taking any-
Well,yes,you were,robert.
Ok.
My plaid shirt.
Is it a school day,mommy?
Yes,darling.
I told you it is.
It is,i believe, in the wash.
I wish it was saturday.
Well,it was saturday, and it will be again.
Bob!
Bob,it's dirty!
The shirt is dirty,kim.
I said have a good day.
It's coming tomorrow.
Stress of moving getting to you?
How was your weekend?
Good weekend.
Not long enough.
I made a call,expedite your furniture delivery.
Well,kim says it's coming tomorrow.
Got a small but good surprise.
Made a couple of calls.
It's coming this morning.
That's real good of you.
Glad to do it.

You brown?
Where are they?
Deployment.
You brown?
I believe this note is for you.
Sergeant?
Slim,jonas wanted you to suss out combat loading,
Ten-By,pallet,c-130 for transport by-
This don't involve no danger pay,
But it is gonna give you a bit of an education.
He wanted me to load this pallet?
It's not as romantic as jumping out of aircrafts and all,
But i think you'll find it has its charms.
Begin with define "combat loading" for me.
No,your little friends ain't here,but i'm here,
And i'm gonna teach you a whole new lovely thing.
Didn't you join the army to learn?
What's combat loading?
Combat loading is the loading of a pack, pallet,aircraft,ship,
Or any other conveyance to maximized combat readiness at the point of debarkation.
That's right.
You wanna put the ammunition so that it is first off before the dartboards.
That's correct.
And that's a good start.
Now,your task is to take this manifest
And under my intermittent supervision,
Load this pallet using,at all times,
Your powers of deduction to create a perfect combat loading:
Assault mission against an entrenched position.
Night.
Tropical.
Off you go.
I thought your team was on deployment.
Get down!
We're taking fire.
They hit anything vital?
Negative.
Well,then, stop complaining.
Slow our friends up a bit,will you?
Oh,boss, look what we have here.
Who?
Patrick collins.
From the terrorist watch list?
Why is he chasing us instead of planning his next anthrax attack?
Chinese military satellite would pay for quite a few misdeeds.
Betty blue,betty blue.
Stand by.
There's been a change in plans.
You ready for a little bit of theatrics?
Sun's coming down hard,boss.
We could lose 'em in 10 minutes.
Don't wanna lose 'em.
We've got traffic dogs on our tail.
And i wanna handle it personally.
We're gonna drag the wing.
You listenin'?
Affirmative.
We're gonna make 'em think we're hit.
We'll skew the truck around like they took out a tire.
What?
We'll skew the truck around like they took out a tire and stop.
Is my husband happy at his work?
You know the problem is stress, but the stress is mine.
What we have here,
This is a photograph of a broken mirror.
And you're saying that some stressed-Out person fired those 2 shots into the mirror.
Yes.
I did.
You fired those shots?
Yes,i did.
At a rat.
At a rat,yes.
And you missed the rat, but you grouped 2 shots,
.45 pistol,2-Shot group, both in the kill zone,
With your husband's pistol.
My husband's pistol,yes.
Es that complete our requirements for today?
Tell me again.
Just 2 people sitting in the room.
Is that what we are,jimmy?
I'm not compelled to attend this meeting.
Failure to comply being grounds for my husband's dismissal from the unit?
Shots fired in an on-Base residential community.
Tell me again.
Jonas came back from mission.
He un-Holstered his pistol,
Laid it on top of the bureau.
He went in to take a shower.
And i came into the bedroom,
And i saw the largest rat anyone's ever seen scurrying-
Up the wall?
And i picked up the pistol and i cranked off 2 shots.
You fired those shots, not your husband.
That's right.
Would you lie to cover for your husband?
Of course.
Are yolying now?
Of course not.
All right.
Sergeant?
I have a message from your wife.
Thank you,mandy.
Sergeantrown.
Yes,colonel.
Sergeant,this is special agent griffiths.
He's representing the fbi,
Pursuant to your actions on the assault and recapture
Of a hijacked airline in wyndahm,idaho.
Sir,i,uh...
I don't...
I don't deserve any special recognition for that mission.
The entire team-
No,son,we aren't here to decorate you.
The government's deciding whether or not
To prosecute you and your pals
For violating a direct order by assaulting
That hijacked airplane without authorization.
You are entitled to an attorney.
Get your mission notes and a fresh set of clothes
And meet us in the cave in an hour.
There's nothing wrong?
No.
Or with the baby?
No.
Don't you ever do this again.
What?
It's kind of a rough day at the shop,huh?
I beg your pardon?
That's fine.
I don't appreciate it.
And i...
If you are well, if the baby is well,
Do not... do not...
What are you talking about?
If you can't deal with some delayed furniture...
What... what do you thi i'm doing at work?
What do you... and i get that message?
What message?
I'm trying to work.
Do you understand that?
I understand.
I don't understand why you're screaming at me.
I'm not screaming at you.
I'm informing you.
I never,absent catastrophic circumstances,
Want to receive this message.
What message?
"Come home. "
- I-
- No.
I'm not interested.
If you're not interested,
Then don't come home until you are interested.
And don't you dare ever speak to me in that way again.
Over there.
Ov there.
Stop.
Where's the nearest water source?
15 kilometers.
Fill the jerricans.
That dog won't hunt.
Take a look.
They plugged us for real.
The canteens.
Great.
Collins will come at us the back way.
Grey,you ready with those?
A little artistry.
How long till party time?
They aren't but a few minutes out.
Gentlemen,
Don't shoot the white guy.
He's our little gift to washington.
Don't shoot the white guy.
Don't shoot the white guy.
Just a few questions, sergeant,
Regarding your comments on the assault on the plane.
Yes,sir.
Now,this is a contemporary account.
I... i don't understand.
You wrote it at the time of the assault.
I wrote my notes on the flight back.
And you were not aware that your unit conducted an unlicensed,
In fact,illegal assault on the said airliner?
With respect,sir, the actions of my unit saved the lives of-
You were aware that until the suspension of the posse comitatus act,
Any independent action taken by your unit was a violation of theaw?
Did you indicate,sir,
That i'm entitled to the services of an attorney?
Do you have something to conceal,sergeant?
Sir,i do not.
Then why would you wish an attorney?
Are you an attorney,sir?
Just answer my questions.
Here we go.
They shot our guy.
Get me out of t line of fire!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
How about that?
Cease fire.
Cease fire.
They got him.
********
We want to talk.
Throw your weapons out!
Come out with your hands over your head!
We want to bargain.
I don't see that you got anything to bargain with.
We've disabled your truck,
And we're between you and the water source.
Come out,or we will come in and kill you.
You advance on us,
I will shoot the european.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Hold your fire
I said i'll kill him!
Why should i care?
You didn't kill him.
You didn't kill him.
Then why did you lure us here?
You want him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right.
You don't care?
You want him dead?
I'll shoot him.
No.
Hold on.
That's better.
Or i'll trade him to you.
For what?
For the piece from the satellite.
My things were supposed to arrive tomorrow.
Made a call to a fella who made a call, and that the army way.
But it's the wrong furniture.
And that's the army way,too,sometimes.
I've been on the phone all day
Instead of signing up for college classes as i planned.
I'm sorry,ma'am.
No,it's not your fault.
Well,hon, it isn't my fault.
I'm not saying that.
I understand.
You're trying to help.
Let me make another call.
Please don't.
I must beg you.
It's not-
Who is it?
It's keisha holmes.
Her husband's in the regular army.
It's randy.
He's in the airborne.
I forget where.
Oh,no.
Keisha holmes.
We know them.
I know them.
C get a little more artistry about you.
I wanna drive out of here with collins and the component.
Can you remove the contents without destroying the data
And leave the box intact?
Give me your watch.
You're a smart cookie, ain't you?
You mean for a black man?
I mean even for a black man.
But i can't give up the satellite component, and you know that.
Then i can't give you our prisoner.
We want him,
But we don't want him that bad.
That's not what your newspapers say.
Don't let 'em take me.
Drive me back to aboukir.
They'll ransom me.
Friend,i don't thk you can live that long.
You want to talk!
We'll talk!
If not?
If not,we kill him!
Then we'll come down and have a little chat with you.
Then he dies,too.
You choose.
He's gonna cheat you.
What do you want with the satellite anyway?
He tell you something?
What do you want with it?
If you can sell it,i can.
It's not mine to sell or trade.
It belongs to my government now.
How much longer?
Wait one.
No.
No.
She's just gonna take him for a little walk,keisha.
No.
I want all of you women out of my house.
Right now.
Keisha,we called the pastor.
I don't want the pastor.
I don't...
I don't want your company.
I don't want you...
Please.
Please.
Where was he stationed?
In iraq.
- Was it his first?
- It was his second deployment.
I know them from bragg.
She shouldn't sit alone.
What are you doing here?
The last time i saw you,keisha,
You borrowed my yellow blouse.
You forgot to give it back.
You forgot to give it back.
You remember,hon?
Where were you going that day?
You were going to meet randy.
I'm so sorry.
That's right.
Were you aware that prior to suspension of the posse comitatus act,
Any military action taken by your unit was in violation of the law?
With respect,sir, i wish you had been with us.
You can screw with me in here if it diverts you.
But be assured, you will pay the price.
You have said i'm entitled to an attorney.
Say the word, and i'll supply one.
Alright then.
Were you aware you were in violation of the law?
The situation,with respect, sir,was in flux.
What is in flux,soldier, is your freedom.
A crime has been committed.
We were in contact with the enemy,sir.
Your friends have committed a crime as well.
I'd like to speak to them now.
Sir,i believe the other members of the team are listed in your report.
Yes.
Where are they?
Sir,they're otherwise engaged.
But you admit to actually participating in the assault on the airliner.
In the assault upon the airliner,no.
But... wait.
I was in the woods neutralizing the terrorist spotters.
But you were present when the decision was made to assault the airplane.
No,sir.
I was in the woods.
Per his orders.
And where is the team that did the actual assaulting of the aircraft?
They've been deployed.
For how long?
I'm afraid that's classified,sir.
Why,when's your report due?
End of the week.
You know, i'm looking at his picture,
But i can't see anything.
Keisha,you're in shock.
I know what it is.
You know,kim,you remember when we were at bragg?
Yes,i do.
And that...
What was her name?
Trisha galloway.
And she had those mirrors.
Did you know that?
What mirrors?
But you know who i meant.
Yes.
And she... you remember,
She had these mirrors set up in the house
So that at any point she could see...
I remember.
The condolence assistance officers
If they came up the walk so she wouldn't be caught...
So she wouldn't be caught unaware.
And i thought, "well,that poor woman has had too much. "
I remember,darling.
But you don't know.
You don't know,kim.
Bob came back from iraq.
That's right.
He did.
Both times he came back.
Yes,he did.
And what is he doing now?
The 303rd logistical studies.
And what is that?
They just...
In effect, he's sort of a clerk.
So you... you don't know.
You don't know,kim, what it does to have a man forever in combat.
Forever in combat, kim,because-
- That's right.
- Forever in combat.
You forget.
You think you remember,
But you don't know
Because... because you're out of it now.
I'm out of it.
And i'm out of it now,too.
Keisha.
We can't know what they're going through.
All right.
I'm gonna tell you what.
The european, is he still alive?
He's alive.
Show me.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the pze.
Come on.
All right.
Now,show me the satellite piece,
And we'll leave one of your jeeps.
I'm not your travel agent.
Get your own ride back.
You have 2 jeeps.
You don't need them both.
The trade is the european for the component and a jeep.
We're all ready.
Did i say the trade was done?
I said it.
The satellite and one of your trucks,
Or the man dies.
Bring it out.
Let's go.
That's close enough.
He'll cheat you.
Do i look like a fool?
Test it.
It's active.
Good.
We drive off now.
If you're gonna go,go.
How long you figure to make the rendezvous?
Easy. 40 minutes of driving.
Let's get on it.
I know some people who wanna talk to you.
A few things to answer for over the years.
A few friends of yours they'd like to find.
Truck's dead.
They put a lucky shot through the engine block.
Truck's dead?
Yes,boss,it is.
We gave them our only working jeep?
Nice.
All right,we're going to the fallback.
Fallback rendezvous is... 19 miles.
I wanna see the hot box with the satellite component in it.
I figure the truck has a stretcher.
If not,rig one.
Full canteens.
Fill 'em up, drink up,ruck up.
How's our friend holding?
He lost a lot of blood.
I can stabilize him,but...
Peritonitis is almost certain.
How did you fool the geiger counter?
Save your strength.
They accepted the box from the satellite,
But,of course, the box is empty.
You crushed up your watches, threw 'em in the box.
Radium from the dials set the geiger counter off.
19 miles. 10 hours.
We've got some hard dry travelg to do.
Let's get to it.
I just need you to sign this form, swearing to the truthfulness of your statement.
How's his appetite?
His appetite?
I thought we were talking about myself.
Of course.
That's right.
His appetite's fine, by the way.
Is he under a lot of stress?
Darling,these men are under all the stress
From the day they log in to the day they retire.
That's not,as i understand it,abnormal.
Psychologically, that's real.
You see your husband takes it easier if you can, when you can.
It's always good to see you,molly.
Thank you,doctor.
You think retirement is the only thing that'delieve the stress?
What?
The only thing to lessen stress is to retire.
That's not what i said.
You're not gonna put that on the form,are you?
Jimmy,don't put that on the form.
I'm not gonna put anything on his form.
Why would i when we're talking about you?
That's right.
He's been talking about retirement?
Lord,what have i done?
We finished here,sir?
Yes.
We're finished.
Colonel.
This isn't over.
Thank you for your time,sir.
That's all.
Thank you,sergeant.
You got something on your mind?
No,sir.
No,i didn't throw you to the wolves,son.
In technical terms, what i did was let you draw fire.
You boys took down the plane.
Everybody knows that.
Well done.
Hoo-Rah.
But you ticked off the fbi
Who had to file a report to save face.
Let 'em save face.
Bulk of the team's out of town because i sent them out.
You never set foot on their blessed aircraft.
Let 'em talk to you.
You savvy?
Sir,might you have told me beforehand it was all a show?
Hell,no.
Son...
You're a hothead.
And as time goes by, you're probably grow out of it.
But today that's what i was looking for.
I wanted you angry and indignant.
Wheels within wheels, young sergeant.
Good work.
Now,get the hell out of here.
Government man's wasted one day of mine's,
Never coming back, and i've got work to do.
All right,hold.
3 minutes.
We don't need it,boss.
I didn't say you need it.
I just said do it.
How much longer on the stretcher?
We got a half hour to rendezvous,
Or it's all academic.
Why don't you leave me here?
'Cause i'm taking you in.
You're taking me in,
But you didn't take me.
Drink this.
That drug's gonna dry you out.
You didn't take me.
I didn't take you, but i got you.
They shot me, and they gave me up.
How about that?
Compass is swinging wild.
2 compasses, 2 different readings.
Pick the one swings freer.
Predominant winds from the north.
Rocks pitted on the north face.
2-8 degrees true will be about...
About there.
L right, coffee break's over.
I put a rocket under 'em.
About what?
I'm lost.
About the furniture for brown.
You called about his furniture.
Did you have a hard day today,molly, with jonas being away?
Evening,mrs.
Gerhardt.
Good evening,colonel.
I'm just picking up some groceries for keisha holmes.
Yeah,i heard.
I'm sorry.
Was there something else you wanted to ask me?
No.
I thought there was something you wanted to ask me.
About?
About dr.
Willey.
I'm meeting with him about stress.
Is thereomething you wanna tell me went on with the doctor?
Can't think of a thing.
Besides,you'll see it in the report.
If jonas needs a break, i'll staff him.
Staff him?
I'll put him on the intel staff.
My husband isn't going to fly a chair.
If he needs it.
What he needs is what you need-
For him to be with his team.
Thank you,molly.
Tom.
Let's get out of here.
Send from blue team.
Mission accomplished.
Additional package on board.
Priority 5.
Requires medivac, security,interrogators.
Code is...
Help me.
What's his code name?
His code name is westwind,boss.
Do we wanna put it on the air?
If they ask who we have,
Respond, "we have somebody you've been looking for. "
How's he doing?
He's alive.
Won't be walking for 6 months,but...
Nice watch.
It was my father's.
I never was big on loot.
Friendly gesture,
But i doubt they'll let me keep it.
That's between you and them,friend.
That fight may go on.
But between you and me,it's over.
We're done for the day.
Go in and put your pajamas on now,honey.
I'll be in in a minute.
Molly.
Well done with keisha.
Molly,i'm sorry i was snippy with you today.
No need to apologize.
Well,yes,there is,
As you were trying to help a woman in need,
And i criticized you for it.
Child,
You impress me.
Mommy!
- Good night.
- Good night.
Go on.
I just came by to get some of my things and i'll-
When is my bed gonna come?
Serena,it's not important.
Yes,it is.
I beg your pardon?
Why don't you go brush your teeth for daddy.
Look,i'm so-
I never called you to say come home.
I called to say call home.
Your precious army garbled the transmission.
I'm sorry.
I called to say the furniture has not arrived,
So maybe you'd like to take us out to dinner.
That's what i called to say.
Mom,can i sleep with you and dad tonight?
Maybe not tonight,honey.
How was your day?
Molly blane calling about the holmes funeral.
Short notice.
No,i'd like to.
It's been a hard day here.
Are your kids at your mother's?
Yeah,for another hour or two.
I wanna see you.
Can you meet me there in 10 minutes?
Sure.
Good.
You have a good night,too,gina.
Keisha holmes, 243 normandy,bellow woods.
Widow of staff sergeant randall holmes, mother of daniel.
She will require 8 seats athe memorial.
Her mother,stepfather, and a party of 6.
I advise 6 additional seats.
Yes.
They always do.
I know.
He doesn't rate a live bugler.
I understand.
But i'd be much obliged if you could.
Thank you,captain.
I..
I'm having trouble breathing.
Thank you.
Will they use torture on me?
I don't think so.
But you're not sure.
It's against the law.
Oh,i see.
Torture is against the law.
This is where you end to,isn't it?
Is it?
Some variation.
Is it where i end?
I expect so.
We've both had a long run.
Haven't we?
Will you tell me your name?
No.
Can't do it,friend.
I'd like to know the name of the man who finally caught me.
I didn't catch you.
Your people gave you up.
Easy.
And,..
I'd like something to eat.
Sure.
Gonna grab him some food.
That guy.
Is he who i think he is?
That's who he is.
That's some story for tomorrow.
I'm sure they'll talk to you about that when we land.
Make it stop!
...stop!
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
This mattress isn't big enough for the 3 of us.
I know.
When's the furniture coming?
It's coming tomorrow.
Mommy,is it a school day?
Indeed it is.
I want my red dress,momm
I know you do,honey.
And tomorrow when the truck arrives-
What?
- My waffle shirt.
- It's coming.
You sent it on the truck?
Most of the things we shipped.
I gave you one child.
I carrying another, presumably yours.
So don't take that attitude.
Mommy,i want my red dress.
I don't believe i was taking any-
Well,yes,you were,robert.
Ok.
My plaid shirt.
Is it a school day,mommy?
Yes,darling.
I told you it is.
It is,i believe, in the wash.
I wish it was saturday.
Well,it was saturday, and it will be again.
Bob!
Bob,it's dirty!
The shirt is dirty,kim.
I said have a good day.
It's coming tomorrow.
Stress of moving getting to you?
How was your weekend?
Good weekend.
Not long enough.
I made a call,expedite your furniture delivery.
Well,kim says it's coming tomorrow.
Got a small but good surprise.
Made a couple of calls.
It's coming this morning.
That's real good of you.
Glad to do it.
Hey,is jonas sleeping in?
Oh,honey,jonas went out with the team last friday night.
Jonas,he left with the team?
Have a good morning.
Serengeti plain africa
Betty blue,betty blue.
China bird in sight, 80 meters to the south.
We have the overwatch.
Down you go.
Go down to the end of the town and back in time for tea.
How's he doing?
You're awfully chatty today, aren't you,boss?
Just ask him.
Betty blue, betty blue.
Sitrep.
Out in 2 minutes.
Satellite appears to be safe.
Fellas,we're about to have some company.
The.
Unit season 01 episode 02
You got 'em?
In range in a few seconds.
Get the satellite component and get out of there.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Hold tight.
They got the component.
I'm not leaving without it.
Alpha team?
No longer at this address.
You brown?
Where are they?
Deployment.
You brown?
I believe this note is for you.
Sergeant?
Slim,jonas wanted you to suss out combat loading,
Ten-By,pallet,c-130 for transport by-
This don't involve no danger pay,
But it is gonna give you a bit of an education.
He wanted me to load this pallet?
It's not as romantic as jumping out of aircrafts and all,
But i think you'll find it has its charms.
Begin with define "combat loading" for me.
No,your little friends ain't here,but i'm here,
And i'm gonna teach you a whole new lovely thing.
Didn't you join the army to learn?
What's combat loading?
Combat loading is the loading of a pack, pallet,aircraft,ship,
Or any other conveyance to maximized combat readiness at the point of debarkation.
That's right.
You wanna put the ammunition so that it is first off before the dartboards.
That's correct.
And that's a good start.
Now,your task is to take this manifest
And under my intermittent supervision,
Load this pallet using,at all times,
Your powers of deduction to create a perfect combat loading:
Assault mission against an entrenched position.
Night.
Tropical.
Off you go.
I thought your team was on deployment.
Get down!
We're taking fire.
They hit anything vital?
Negative.
Well,then, stop complaining.
Slow our friends up a bit,will you?
Oh,boss, look what we have here.
Who?
Patrick collins.
From the terrorist watch list?
Why is he chasing us instead of planning his next anthrax attack?
Chinese military satellite would pay for quite a few misdeeds.
Betty blue,betty blue.
Stand by.
There's been a change in plans.
You ready for a little bit of theatrics?
Sun's coming down hard,boss.
We could lose 'em in 10 minutes.
Don't wanna lose 'em.
We've got traffic dogs on our tail.
And i wanna handle it personally.
We're gonna drag the wing.
You listenin'?
Affirmative.
We're gonna make 'em think we're hit.
We'll skew the truck around like they took out a tire.
What?
We'll skew the truck around like they took out a tire and stop.
Is my husband happy at his work?
You know the problem is stress, but the stress is mine.
What we have here,
This is a photograph of a broken mirror.
And you're saying that some stressed-Out person fired those 2 shots into the mirror.
Yes.
I did.
You fired those shots?
Yes,i did.
At a rat.
At a rat,yes.
And you missed the rat, but you grouped 2 shots,
.45 pistol,2-Shot group, both in the kill zone,
With your husband's pistol.
My husband's pistol,yes.
Es that complete our requirements for today?
Tell me again.
Just 2 people sitting in the room.
Is that what we are,jimmy?
I'm not compelled to attend this meeting.
Failure to comply being grounds for my husband's dismissal from the unit?
Shots fired in an on-Base residential community.
Tell me again.
Jonas came back from mission.
He un-Holstered his pistol,
Laid it on top of the bureau.
He went in to take a shower.
And i came into the bedroom,
And i saw the largest rat anyone's ever seen scurrying-
Up the wall?
And i picked up the pistol and i cranked off 2 shots.
You fired those shots, not your husband.
That's right.
Would you lie to cover for your husband?
Of course.
Are yolying now?
Of course not.
All right.
Sergeant?
I have a message from your wife.
Thank you,mandy.
Sergeantrown.
Yes,colonel.
Sergeant,this is special agent griffiths.
He's representing the fbi,
Pursuant to your actions on the assault and recapture
Of a hijacked airline in wyndahm,idaho.
Sir,i,uh...
I don't...
I don't deserve any special recognition for that mission.
The entire team-
No,son,we aren't here to decorate you.
The government's deciding whether or not
To prosecute you and your pals
For violating a direct order by assaulting
That hijacked airplane without authorization.
You are entitled to an attorney.
Get your mission notes and a fresh set of clothes
And meet us in the cave in an hour.
There's nothing wrong?
No.
Or with the baby?
No.
Don't you ever do this again.
What?
It's kind of a rough day at the shop,huh?
I beg your pardon?
That's fine.
I don't appreciate it.
And i...
If you are well, if the baby is well,
Do not... do not...
What are you talking about?
If you can't deal with some delayed furniture...
What... what do you thi i'm doing at work?
What do you... and i get that message?
What message?
I'm trying to work.
Do you understand that?
I understand.
I don't understand why you're screaming at me.
I'm not screaming at you.
I'm informing you.
I never,absent catastrophic circumstances,
Want to receive this message.
What message?
"Come home. "
- I-
- No.
I'm not interested.
If you're not interested,
Then don't come home until you are interested.
And don't you dare ever speak to me in that way again.
Over there.
Ov there.
Stop.
Where's the nearest water source?
15 kilometers.
Fill the jerricans.
That dog won't hunt.
Take a look.
They plugged us for real.
The canteens.
Great.
Collins will come at us the back way.
Grey,you ready with those?
A little artistry.
How long till party time?
They aren't but a few minutes out.
Gentlemen,
Don't shoot the white guy.
He's our little gift to washington.
Don't shoot the white guy.
Don't shoot the white guy.
Just a few questions, sergeant,
Regarding your comments on the assault on the plane.
Yes,sir.
Now,this is a contemporary account.
I... i don't understand.
You wrote it at the time of the assault.
I wrote my notes on the flight back.
And you were not aware that your unit conducted an unlicensed,
In fact,illegal assault on the said airliner?
With respect,sir, the actions of my unit saved the lives of-
You were aware that until the suspension of the posse comitatus act,
Any independent action taken by your unit was a violation of theaw?
Did you indicate,sir,
That i'm entitled to the services of an attorney?
Do you have something to conceal,sergeant?
Sir,i do not.
Then why would you wish an attorney?
Are you an attorney,sir?
Just answer my questions.
Here we go.
They shot our guy.
Get me out of t line of fire!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
How about that?
Cease fire.
Cease fire.
They got him.
********
We want to talk.
Throw your weapons out!
Come out with your hands over your head!
We want to bargain.
I don't see that you got anything to bargain with.
We've disabled your truck,
And we're between you and the water source.
Come out,or we will come in and kill you.
You advance on us,
I will shoot the european.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Hold your fire
I said i'll kill him!
Why should i care?
You didn't kill him.
You didn't kill him.
Then why did you lure us here?
You want him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right.
You don't care?
You want him dead?
I'll shoot him.
No.
Hold on.
That's better.
Or i'll trade him to you.
For what?
For the piece from the satellite.
My things were supposed to arrive tomorrow.
Made a call to a fella who made a call, and that the army way.
But it's the wrong furniture.
And that's the army way,too,sometimes.
I've been on the phone all day
Instead of signing up for college classes as i planned.
I'm sorry,ma'am.
No,it's not your fault.
Well,hon, it isn't my fault.
I'm not saying that.
I understand.
You're trying to help.
Let me make another call.
Please don't.
I must beg you.
It's not-
Who is it?
It's keisha holmes.
Her husband's in the regular army.
It's randy.
He's in the airborne.
I forget where.
Oh,no.
Keisha holmes.
We know them.
I know them.
C get a little more artistry about you.
I wanna drive out of here with collins and the component.
Can you remove the contents without destroying the data
And leave the box intact?
Give me your watch.
You're a smart cookie, ain't you?
You mean for a black man?
I mean even for a black man.
But i can't give up the satellite component, and you know that.
Then i can't give you our prisoner.
We want him,
But we don't want him that bad.
That's not what your newspapers say.
Don't let 'em take me.
Drive me back to aboukir.
They'll ransom me.
Friend,i don't thk you can live that long.
You want to talk!
We'll talk!
If not?
If not,we kill him!
Then we'll come down and have a little chat with you.
Then he dies,too.
You choose.
He's gonna cheat you.
What do you want with the satellite anyway?
He tell you something?
What do you want with it?
If you can sell it,i can.
It's not mine to sell or trade.
It belongs to my government now.
How much longer?
Wait one.
No.
No.
She's just gonna take him for a little walk,keisha.
No.
I want all of you women out of my house.
Right now.
Keisha,we called the pastor.
I don't want the pastor.
I don't...
I don't want your company.
I don't want you...
Please.
Please.
Where was he stationed?
In iraq.
- Was it his first?
- It was his second deployment.
I know them from bragg.
She shouldn't sit alone.
What are you doing here?
The last time i saw you,keisha,
You borrowed my yellow blouse.
You forgot to give it back.
You forgot to give it back.
You remember,hon?
Where were you going that day?
You were going to meet randy.
I'm so sorry.
That's right.
Were you aware that prior to suspension of the posse comitatus act,
Any military action taken by your unit was in violation of the law?
With respect,sir, i wish you had been with us.
You can screw with me in here if it diverts you.
But be assured, you will pay the price.
You have said i'm entitled to an attorney.
Say the word, and i'll supply one.
Alright then.
Were you aware you were in violation of the law?
The situation,with respect, sir,was in flux.
What is in flux,soldier, is your freedom.
A crime has been committed.
We were in contact with the enemy,sir.
Your friends have committed a crime as well.
I'd like to speak to them now.
Sir,i believe the other members of the team are listed in your report.
Yes.
Where are they?
Sir,they're otherwise engaged.
But you admit to actually participating in the assault on the airliner.
In the assault upon the airliner,no.
But... wait.
I was in the woods neutralizing the terrorist spotters.
But you were present when the decision was made to assault the airplane.
No,sir.
I was in the woods.
Per his orders.
And where is the team that did the actual assaulting of the aircraft?
They've been deployed.
For how long?
I'm afraid that's classified,sir.
Why,when's your report due?
End of the week.
You know, i'm looking at his picture,
But i can't see anything.
Keisha,you're in shock.
I know what it is.
You know,kim,you remember when we were at bragg?
Yes,i do.
And that...
What was her name?
Trisha galloway.
And she had those mirrors.
Did you know that?
What mirrors?
But you know who i meant.
Yes.
And she... you remember,
She had these mirrors set up in the house
So that at any point she could see...
I remember.
The condolence assistance officers
If they came up the walk so she wouldn't be caught...
So she wouldn't be caught unaware.
And i thought, "well,that poor woman has had too much. "
I remember,darling.
But you don't know.
You don't know,kim.
Bob came back from iraq.
That's right.
He did.
Both times he came back.
Yes,he did.
And what is he doing now?
The 303rd logistical studies.
And what is that?
They just...
In effect, he's sort of a clerk.
So you... you don't know.
You don't know,kim, what it does to have a man forever in combat.
Forever in combat, kim,because-
- That's right.
- Forever in combat.
You forget.
You think you remember,
But you don't know
Because... because you're out of it now.
I'm out of it.
And i'm out of it now,too.
Keisha.
We can't know what they're going through.
All right.
I'm gonna tell you what.
The european, is he still alive?
He's alive.
Show me.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the pze.
Come on.
All right.
Now,show me the satellite piece,
And we'll leave one of your jeeps.
I'm not your travel agent.
Get your own ride back.
You have 2 jeeps.
You don't need them both.
The trade is the european for the component and a jeep.
We're all ready.
Did i say the trade was done?
I said it.
The satellite and one of your trucks,
Or the man dies.
Bring it out.
Let's go.
That's close enough.
He'll cheat you.
Do i look like a fool?
Test it.
It's active.
Good.
We drive off now.
If you're gonna go,go.
How long you figure to make the rendezvous?
Easy. 40 minutes of driving.
Let's get on it.
I know some people who wanna talk to you.
A few things to answer for over the years.
A few friends of yours they'd like to find.
Truck's dead.
They put a lucky shot through the engine block.
Truck's dead?
Yes,boss,it is.
We gave them our only working jeep?
Nice.
All right,we're going to the fallback.
Fallback rendezvous is... 19 miles.
I wanna see the hot box with the satellite component in it.
I figure the truck has a stretcher.
If not,rig one.
Full canteens.
Fill 'em up, drink up,ruck up.
How's our friend holding?
He lost a lot of blood.
I can stabilize him,but...
Peritonitis is almost certain.
How did you fool the geiger counter?
Save your strength.
They accepted the box from the satellite,
But,of course, the box is empty.
You crushed up your watches, threw 'em in the box.
Radium from the dials set the geiger counter off.
19 miles. 10 hours.
We've got some hard dry travelg to do.
Let's get to it.
I just need you to sign this form, swearing to the truthfulness of your statement.
How's his appetite?
His appetite?
I thought we were talking about myself.
Of course.
That's right.
His appetite's fine, by the way.
Is he under a lot of stress?
Darling,these men are under all the stress
From the day they log in to the day they retire.
That's not,as i understand it,abnormal.
Psychologically, that's real.
You see your husband takes it easier if you can, when you can.
It's always good to see you,molly.
Thank you,doctor.
You think retirement is the only thing that'delieve the stress?
What?
The only thing to lessen stress is to retire.
That's not what i said.
You're not gonna put that on the form,are you?
Jimmy,don't put that on the form.
I'm not gonna put anything on his form.
Why would i when we're talking about you?
That's right.
He's been talking about retirement?
Lord,what have i done?
We finished here,sir?
Yes.
We're finished.
Colonel.
This isn't over.
Thank you for your time,sir.
That's all.
Thank you,sergeant.
You got something on your mind?
No,sir.
No,i didn't throw you to the wolves,son.
In technical terms, what i did was let you draw fire.
You boys took down the plane.
Everybody knows that.
Well done.
Hoo-Rah.
But you ticked off the fbi
Who had to file a report to save face.
Let 'em save face.
Bulk of the team's out of town because i sent them out.
You never set foot on their blessed aircraft.
Let 'em talk to you.
You savvy?
Sir,might you have told me beforehand it was all a show?
Hell,no.
Son...
You're a hothead.
And as time goes by, you're probably grow out of it.
But today that's what i was looking for.
I wanted you angry and indignant.
Wheels within wheels, young sergeant.
Good work.
Now,get the hell out of here.
Government man's wasted one day of mine's,
Never coming back, and i've got work to do.
All right,hold.
3 minutes.
We don't need it,boss.
I didn't say you need it.
I just said do it.
How much longer on the stretcher?
We got a half hour to rendezvous,
Or it's all academic.
Why don't you leave me here?
'Cause i'm taking you in.
You're taking me in,
But you didn't take me.
Drink this.
That drug's gonna dry you out.
You didn't take me.
I didn't take you, but i got you.
They shot me, and they gave me up.
How about that?
Compass is swinging wild.
2 compasses, 2 different readings.
Pick the one swings freer.
Predominant winds from the north.
Rocks pitted on the north face.
2-8 degrees true will be about...
About there.
L right, coffee break's over.
I put a rocket under 'em.
About what?
I'm lost.
About the furniture for brown.
You called about his furniture.
Did you have a hard day today,molly, with jonas being away?
Evening,mrs.
Gerhardt.
Good evening,colonel.
I'm just picking up some groceries for keisha holmes.
Yeah,i heard.
I'm sorry.
Was there something else you wanted to ask me?
No.
I thought there was something you wanted to ask me.
About?
About dr.
Willey.
I'm meeting with him about stress.
Is thereomething you wanna tell me went on with the doctor?
Can't think of a thing.
Besides,you'll see it in the report.
If jonas needs a break, i'll staff him.
Staff him?
I'll put him on the intel staff.
My husband isn't going to fly a chair.
If he needs it.
What he needs is what you need-
For him to be with his team.
Thank you,molly.
Tom.
Let's get out of here.
Send from blue team.
Mission accomplished.
Additional package on board.
Priority 5.
Requires medivac, security,interrogators.
Code is...
Help me.
What's his code name?
His code name is westwind,boss.
Do we wanna put it on the air?
If they ask who we have,
Respond, "we have somebody you've been looking for. "
How's he doing?
He's alive.
Won't be walking for 6 months,but...
Nice watch.
It was my father's.
I never was big on loot.
Friendly gesture,
But i doubt they'll let me keep it.
That's between you and them,friend.
That fight may go on.
But between you and me,it's over.
We're done for the day.
Go in and put your pajamas on now,honey.
I'll be in in a minute.
Molly.
Well done with keisha.
Molly,i'm sorry i was snippy with you today.
No need to apologize.
Well,yes,there is,
As you were trying to help a woman in need,
And i criticized you for it.
Child,
You impress me.
Mommy!
- Good night.
- Good night.
Go on.
I just came by to get some of my things and i'll-
When is my bed gonna come?
Serena,it's not important.
Yes,it is.
I beg your pardon?
Why don't you go brush your teeth for daddy.
Look,i'm so-
I never called you to say come home.
I called to say call home.
Your precious army garbled the transmission.
I'm sorry.
I called to say the furniture has not arrived,
So maybe you'd like to take us out to dinner.
That's what i called to say.
Mom,can i sleep with you and dad tonight?
Maybe not tonight,honey.
How was your day?
Molly blane calling about the holmes funeral.
Short notice.
No,i'd like to.
It's been a hard day here.
Are your kids at your mother's?
Yeah,for another hour or two.
I wanna see you.
Can you meet me there in 10 minutes?
Sure.
Good.
You have a good night,too,gina.
Keisha holmes, 243 normandy,bellow woods.

Her mother,stepfather, and a party of 6.
I advise 6 additional seats.
Yes.
They always do.
I know.
He doesn't rate a live bugler.
I understand.
But i'd be much obliged if you could.
Thank you,captain.
I..
I'm having trouble breathing.
Thank you.
Will they use torture on me?
I don't think so.
But you're not sure.
It's against the law.
Oh,i see.
Torture is against the law.
This is where you end to,isn't it?
Is it?
Some variation.
Is it where i end?
I expect so.
We've both had a long run.
Haven't we?
Will you tell me your name?
No.
Can't do it,friend.
I'd like to know the name of the man who finally caught me.
I didn't catch you.
Your people gave you up.
Easy.
And,..
I'd like something to eat.
Sure.
Gonna grab him some food.
That guy.
Is he who i think he is?
That's who he is.
That's some story for tomorrow.
I'm sure they'll talk to you about that when we land.
The.
Unit "stress" season 01 episode 02
Make it stop!
...stop!
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
This mattress isn't big enough for the 3 of us.
I know.
When's the furniture coming?
It's coming tomorrow.
Mommy,is it a school day?
Indeed it is.
I want my red dress,momm
I know you do,honey.
And tomorrow when the truck arrives-
What?
- My waffle shirt.
- It's coming.
You sent it on the truck?
Most of the things we shipped.
I gave you one child.
I carrying another, presumably yours.
So don't take that attitude.
Mommy,i want my red dress.
I don't believe i was taking any-
Well,yes,you were,robert.
Ok.
My plaid shirt.
Is it a school day,mommy?
Yes,darling.
I told you it is.
It is,i believe, in the wash.
I wish it was saturday.
Well,it was saturday, and it will be again.
Bob!
Bob,it's dirty!
The shirt is dirty,kim.
I said have a good day.
It's coming tomorrow.
Stress of moving getting to you?
How was your weekend?
Good weekend.
Not long enough.
I made a call,expedite your furniture delivery.
Well,kim says it's coming tomorrow.
Got a small but good surprise.
Made a couple of calls.
It's coming this morning.
That's real good of you.
Glad to do it.
Hey,is jonas sleeping in?
Oh,honey,jonas went out with the team last friday night.
Jonas,he left with the team?
Have a good morning.
Serengeti plain africa
Betty blue,betty blue.
China bird in sight, 80 meters to the south.
We have the overwatch.
Down you go.
Go down to the end of the town and back in time for tea.
How's he doing?
You're awfully chatty today, aren't you,boss?
Just ask him.
Betty blue, betty blue.
Sitrep.
Out in 2 minutes.
Satellite appears to be safe.
Fellas,we're about to have some company.
The.
Unit season 01 episode 02
You got 'em?
In range in a few seconds.
Get the satellite component and get out of there.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Hold tight.
They got the component.
I'm not leaving without it.
Alpha team?
No longer at this address.
You brown?
Where are they?
Deployment.
You brown?
I believe this note is for you.
Sergeant?
Slim,jonas wanted you to suss out combat loading,
Ten-By,pallet,c-130 for transport by-
This don't involve no danger pay,
But it is gonna give you a bit of an education.
He wanted me to load this pallet?
It's not as romantic as jumping out of aircrafts and all,
But i think you'll find it has its charms.
Begin with define "combat loading" for me.
No,your little friends ain't here,but i'm here,
And i'm gonna teach you a whole new lovely thing.
Didn't you join the army to learn?
What's combat loading?
Combat loading is the loading of a pack, pallet,aircraft,ship,
Or any other conveyance to maximized combat readiness at the point of debarkation.
That's right.
You wanna put the ammunition so that it is first off before the dartboards.
That's correct.
And that's a good start.
Now,your task is to take this manifest
And under my intermittent supervision,
Load this pallet using,at all times,
Your powers of deduction to create a perfect combat loading:
Assault mission against an entrenched position.
Night.
Tropical.
Off you go.
I thought your team was on deployment.
Get down!
We're taking fire.
They hit anything vital?
Negative.
Well,then, stop complaining.
Slow our friends up a bit,will you?
Oh,boss, look what we have here.
Who?
Patrick collins.
From the terrorist watch list?
Why is he chasing us instead of planning his next anthrax attack?
Chinese military satellite would pay for quite a few misdeeds.
Betty blue,betty blue.
Stand by.
There's been a change in plans.
You ready for a little bit of theatrics?
Sun's coming down hard,boss.
We could lose 'em in 10 minutes.
Don't wanna lose 'em.
We've got traffic dogs on our tail.
And i wanna handle it personally.
We're gonna drag the wing.
You listenin'?
Affirmative.
We're gonna make 'em think we're hit.
We'll skew the truck around like they took out a tire.
What?
We'll skew the truck around like they took out a tire and stop.
Is my husband happy at his work?
You know the problem is stress, but the stress is mine.
What we have here,
This is a photograph of a broken mirror.
And you're saying that some stressed-Out person fired those 2 shots into the mirror.
Yes.
I did.
You fired those shots?
Yes,i did.
At a rat.
At a rat,yes.
And you missed the rat, but you grouped 2 shots,
.45 pistol,2-Shot group, both in the kill zone,
With your husband's pistol.
My husband's pistol,yes.
Es that complete our requirements for today?
Tell me again.
Just 2 people sitting in the room.
Is that what we are,jimmy?
I'm not compelled to attend this meeting.
Failure to comply being grounds for my husband's dismissal from the unit?
Shots fired in an on-Base residential community.
Tell me again.
Jonas came back from mission.
He un-Holstered his pistol,
Laid it on top of the bureau.
He went in to take a shower.
And i came into the bedroom,
And i saw the largest rat anyone's ever seen scurrying-
Up the wall?
And i picked up the pistol and i cranked off 2 shots.
You fired those shots, not your husband.
That's right.
Would you lie to cover for your husband?
Of course.
Are yolying now?
Of course not.
All right.
Sergeant?
I have a message from your wife.
Thank you,mandy.
Sergeantrown.
Yes,colonel.
Sergeant,this is special agent griffiths.
He's representing the fbi,
Pursuant to your actions on the assault and recapture
Of a hijacked airline in wyndahm,idaho.
Sir,i,uh...
I don't...
I don't deserve any special recognition for that mission.
The entire team-
No,son,we aren't here to decorate you.
The government's deciding whether or not
To prosecute you and your pals
For violating a direct order by assaulting
That hijacked airplane without authorization.
You are entitled to an attorney.
Get your mission notes and a fresh set of clothes
And meet us in the cave in an hour.
There's nothing wrong?
No.
Or with the baby?
No.
Don't you ever do this again.
What?
It's kind of a rough day at the shop,huh?
I beg your pardon?
That's fine.
I don't appreciate it.
And i...
If you are well, if the baby is well,
Do not... do not...
What are you talking about?
If you can't deal with some delayed furniture...
What... what do you thi i'm doing at work?
What do you... and i get that message?
What message?
I'm trying to work.
Do you understand that?
I understand.
I don't understand why you're screaming at me.
I'm not screaming at you.
I'm informing you.
I never,absent catastrophic circumstances,
Want to receive this message.
What message?
"Come home. "
- I-
- No.
I'm not interested.
If you're not interested,
Then don't come home until you are interested.
And don't you dare ever speak to me in that way again.
Over there.
Ov there.
Stop.
Where's the nearest water source?
15 kilometers.
Fill the jerricans.
That dog won't hunt.
Take a look.
They plugged us for real.
The canteens.
Great.
Collins will come at us the back way.
Grey,you ready with those?
A little artistry.
How long till party time?
They aren't but a few minutes out.
Gentlemen,
Don't shoot the white guy.
He's our little gift to washington.
Don't shoot the white guy.
Don't shoot the white guy.
Just a few questions, sergeant,
Regarding your comments on the assault on the plane.
Yes,sir.
Now,this is a contemporary account.
I... i don't understand.
You wrote it at the time of the assault.
I wrote my notes on the flight back.
And you were not aware that your unit conducted an unlicensed,
In fact,illegal assault on the said airliner?
With respect,sir, the actions of my unit saved the lives of-
You were aware that until the suspension of the posse comitatus act,
Any independent action taken by your unit was a violation of theaw?
Did you indicate,sir,
That i'm entitled to the services of an attorney?
Do you have something to conceal,sergeant?
Sir,i do not.
Then why would you wish an attorney?
Are you an attorney,sir?
Just answer my questions.
Here we go.
They shot our guy.
Get me out of t line of fire!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
How about that?
Cease fire.
Cease fire.
They got him.
********
We want to talk.
Throw your weapons out!
Come out with your hands over your head!
We want to bargain.
I don't see that you got anything to bargain with.
We've disabled your truck,
And we're between you and the water source.
Come out,or we will come in and kill you.
You advance on us,
I will shoot the european.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Hold your fire
I said i'll kill him!
Why should i care?
You didn't kill him.
You didn't kill him.
Then why did you lure us here?
You want him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right.
You don't care?
You want him dead?
I'll shoot him.
No.
Hold on.
That's better.
Or i'll trade him to you.
For what?
For the piece from the satellite.
My things were supposed to arrive tomorrow.
Made a call to a fella who made a call, and that the army way.
But it's the wrong furniture.
And that's the army way,too,sometimes.
I've been on the phone all day
Instead of signing up for college classes as i planned.
I'm sorry,ma'am.
No,it's not your fault.
Well,hon, it isn't my fault.
I'm not saying that.
I understand.
You're trying to help.
Let me make another call.
Please don't.
I must beg you.
It's not-
Who is it?
It's keisha holmes.
Her husband's in the regular army.
It's randy.
He's in the airborne.
I forget where.
Oh,no.
Keisha holmes.
We know them.
I know them.
C get a little more artistry about you.
I wanna drive out of here with collins and the component.
Can you remove the contents without destroying the data
And leave the box intact?
Give me your watch.
You're a smart cookie, ain't you?
You mean for a black man?
I mean even for a black man.
But i can't give up the satellite component, and you know that.
Then i can't give you our prisoner.
We want him,
But we don't want him that bad.
That's not what your newspapers say.
Don't let 'em take me.
Drive me back to aboukir.
They'll ransom me.
Friend,i don't thk you can live that long.
You want to talk!
We'll talk!
If not?
If not,we kill him!
Then we'll come down and have a little chat with you.
Then he dies,too.
You choose.
He's gonna cheat you.
What do you want with the satellite anyway?
He tell you something?
What do you want with it?
If you can sell it,i can.
It's not mine to sell or trade.
It belongs to my government now.
How much longer?
Wait one.
No.
No.
She's just gonna take him for a little walk,keisha.
No.
I want all of you women out of my house.
Right now.
Keisha,we called the pastor.
I don't want the pastor.
I don't...
I don't want your company.
I don't want you...
Please.
Please.
Where was he stationed?
In iraq.
- Was it his first?
- It was his second deployment.
I know them from bragg.
She shouldn't sit alone.
What are you doing here?
The last time i saw you,keisha,
You borrowed my yellow blouse.
You forgot to give it back.
You forgot to give it back.
You remember,hon?
Where were you going that day?
You were going to meet randy.
I'm so sorry.
That's right.
Were you aware that prior to suspension of the posse comitatus act,
Any military action taken by your unit was in violation of the law?
With respect,sir, i wish you had been with us.
You can screw with me in here if it diverts you.
But be assured, you will pay the price.
You have said i'm entitled to an attorney.
Say the word, and i'll supply one.
Alright then.
Were you aware you were in violation of the law?
The situation,with respect, sir,was in flux.
What is in flux,soldier, is your freedom.
A crime has been committed.
We were in contact with the enemy,sir.
Your friends have committed a crime as well.
I'd like to speak to them now.
Sir,i believe the other members of the team are listed in your report.
Yes.
Where are they?
Sir,they're otherwise engaged.
But you admit to actually participating in the assault on the airliner.
In the assault upon the airliner,no.
But... wait.
I was in the woods neutralizing the terrorist spotters.
But you were present when the decision was made to assault the airplane.
No,sir.
I was in the woods.
Per his orders.
And where is the team that did the actual assaulting of the aircraft?
They've been deployed.
For how long?
I'm afraid that's classified,sir.
Why,when's your report due?
End of the week.
You know, i'm looking at his picture,
But i can't see anything.
Keisha,you're in shock.
I know what it is.
You know,kim,you remember when we were at bragg?
Yes,i do.
And that...
What was her name?
Trisha galloway.
And she had those mirrors.
Did you know that?
What mirrors?
But you know who i meant.
Yes.
And she... you remember,
She had these mirrors set up in the house
So that at any point she could see...
I remember.
The condolence assistance officers
If they came up the walk so she wouldn't be caught...
So she wouldn't be caught unaware.
And i thought, "well,that poor woman has had too much. "
I remember,darling.
But you don't know.
You don't know,kim.
Bob came back from iraq.
That's right.
He did.
Both times he came back.
Yes,he did.
And what is he doing now?
The 303rd logistical studies.
And what is that?
They just...
In effect, he's sort of a clerk.
So you... you don't know.
You don't know,kim, what it does to have a man forever in combat.
Forever in combat, kim,because-
- That's right.
- Forever in combat.
You forget.
You think you remember,
But you don't know
Because... because you're out of it now.
I'm out of it.
And i'm out of it now,too.
Keisha.
We can't know what they're going through.
All right.
I'm gonna tell you what.
The european, is he still alive?
He's alive.
Show me.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the pze.
Come on.
All right.
Now,show me the satellite piece,
And we'll leave one of your jeeps.
I'm not your travel agent.
Get your own ride back.
You have 2 jeeps.
You don't need them both.
The trade is the european for the component and a jeep.
We're all ready.
Did i say the trade was done?
I said it.
The satellite and one of your trucks,
Or the man dies.
Bring it out.
Let's go.
That's close enough.
He'll cheat you.
Do i look like a fool?
Test it.
It's active.
Good.
We drive off now.
If you're gonna go,go.
How long you figure to make the rendezvous?
Easy. 40 minutes of driving.
Let's get on it.
I know some people who wanna talk to you.
A few things to answer for over the years.
A few friends of yours they'd like to find.
Truck's dead.
They put a lucky shot through the engine block.
Truck's dead?
Yes,boss,it is.
We gave them our only working jeep?
Nice.
All right,we're going to the fallback.
Fallback rendezvous is... 19 miles.
I wanna see the hot box with the satellite component in it.
I figure the truck has a stretcher.
If not,rig one.
Full canteens.
Fill 'em up, drink up,ruck up.
How's our friend holding?
He lost a lot of blood.
I can stabilize him,but...
Peritonitis is almost certain.
How did you fool the geiger counter?
Save your strength.
They accepted the box from the satellite,
But,of course, the box is empty.
You crushed up your watches, threw 'em in the box.
Radium from the dials set the geiger counter off.
19 miles. 10 hours.
We've got some hard dry travelg to do.
Let's get to it.
I just need you to sign this form, swearing to the truthfulness of your statement.
How's his appetite?
His appetite?
I thought we were talking about myself.
Of course.
That's right.
His appetite's fine, by the way.
Is he under a lot of stress?
Darling,these men are under all the stress
From the day they log in to the day they retire.
That's not,as i understand it,abnormal.
Psychologically, that's real.
You see your husband takes it easier if you can, when you can.
It's always good to see you,molly.
Thank you,doctor.
You think retirement is the only thing that'delieve the stress?
What?
The only thing to lessen stress is to retire.
That's not what i said.
You're not gonna put that on the form,are you?
Jimmy,don't put that on the form.
I'm not gonna put anything on his form.
Why would i when we're talking about you?
That's right.
He's been talking about retirement?
Lord,what have i done?
We finished here,sir?
Yes.
We're finished.
Colonel.
This isn't over.
Thank you for your time,sir.
That's all.
Thank you,sergeant.
You got something on your mind?
No,sir.
No,i didn't throw you to the wolves,son.
In technical terms, what i did was let you draw fire.
You boys took down the plane.
Everybody knows that.
Well done.
Hoo-Rah.
But you ticked off the fbi
Who had to file a report to save face.
Let 'em save face.
Bulk of the team's out of town because i sent them out.
You never set foot on their blessed aircraft.
Let 'em talk to you.
You savvy?
Sir,might you have told me beforehand it was all a show?
Hell,no.
Son...
You're a hothead.
And as time goes by, you're probably grow out of it.
But today that's what i was looking for.
I wanted you angry and indignant.
Wheels within wheels, young sergeant.
Good work.
Now,get the hell out of here.
Government man's wasted one day of mine's,
Never coming back, and i've got work to do.
All right,hold.
3 minutes.
We don't need it,boss.
I didn't say you need it.
I just said do it.
How much longer on the stretcher?
We got a half hour to rendezvous,
Or it's all academic.
Why don't you leave me here?
'Cause i'm taking you in.
You're taking me in,
But you didn't take me.
Drink this.
That drug's gonna dry you out.
You didn't take me.
I didn't take you, but i got you.
They shot me, and they gave me up.
How about that?
Compass is swinging wild.
2 compasses, 2 different readings.
Pick the one swings freer.
Predominant winds from the north.
Rocks pitted on the north face.
2-8 degrees true will be about...
About there.
L right, coffee break's over.
I put a rocket under 'em.
About what?
I'm lost.
About the furniture for brown.
You called about his furniture.
Did you have a hard day today,molly, with jonas being away?
Evening,mrs.
Gerhardt.
Good evening,colonel.
I'm just picking up some groceries for keisha holmes.
Yeah,i heard.
I'm sorry.
Was there something else you wanted to ask me?
No.
I thought there was something you wanted to ask me.
About?
About dr.
Willey.
I'm meeting with him about stress.
Is thereomething you wanna tell me went on with the doctor?
Can't think of a thing.
Besides,you'll see it in the report.
If jonas needs a break, i'll staff him.
Staff him?
I'll put him on the intel staff.
My husband isn't going to fly a chair.
If he needs it.
What he needs is what you need-
For him to be with his team.
Thank you,molly.
Tom.
Let's get out of here.
Send from blue team.
Mission accomplished.
Additional package on board.
Priority 5.
Requires medivac, security,interrogators.
Code is...
Help me.
What's his code name?
His code name is westwind,boss.
Do we wanna put it on the air?
If they ask who we have,
Respond, "we have somebody you've been looking for. "
How's he doing?
He's alive.
Won't be walking for 6 months,but...
Nice watch.
It was my father's.
I never was big on loot.
Friendly gesture,
But i doubt they'll let me keep it.
That's between you and them,friend.
That fight may go on.
But between you and me,it's over.
We're done for the day.
Go in and put your pajamas on now,honey.
I'll be in in a minute.
Molly.
Well done with keisha.
Molly,i'm sorry i was snippy with you today.
No need to apologize.
Well,yes,there is,
As you were trying to help a woman in need,
And i criticized you for it.
Child,
You impress me.
Mommy!
- Good night.
- Good night.
Go on.
I just came by to get some of my things and i'll-
When is my bed gonna come?
Serena,it's not important.
Yes,it is.
I beg your pardon?
Why don't you go brush your teeth for daddy.
Look,i'm so-
I never called you to say come home.
I called to say call home.
Your precious army garbled the transmission.
I'm sorry.
I called to say the furniture has not arrived,
So maybe you'd like to take us out to dinner.
That's what i called to say.
Mom,can i sleep with you and dad tonight?
Maybe not tonight,honey.
How was your day?
Molly blane calling about the holmes funeral.
Short notice.
No,i'd like to.
It's been a hard day here.
Are your kids at your mother's?
Yeah,for another hour or two.
I wanna see you.
Can you meet me there in 10 minutes?
Sure.
Good.
You have a good night,too,gina.
Keisha holmes, 243 normandy,bellow woods.
Widow of staff sergeant randall holmes, mother of daniel.
She will require 8 seats athe memorial.
Her mother,stepfather, and a party of 6.
I advise 6 additional seats.
Yes.
They always do.
I know.
He doesn't rate a live bugler.
I understand.
But i'd be much obliged if you could.
Thank you,captain.
I..
I'm having trouble breathing.
Thank you.
Will they use torture on me?
I don't think so.
But you're not sure.
It's against the law.
Oh,i see.
Torture is against the law.
This is where you end to,isn't it?
Is it?
Some variation.
Is it where i end?
I expect so.
We've both had a long run.
Haven't we?
Will you tell me your name?
No.
Can't do it,friend.
I'd like to know the name of the man who finally caught me.
I didn't catch you.
Your people gave you up.
Easy.
And,..
I'd like something to eat.
Sure.
Gonna grab him some food.
That guy.
Is he who i think he is?
That's who he is.
That's some story for tomorrow.
I'm sure they'll talk to you about that when we land.
The.
Unit "stress" season 01 episode 02
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
This mattress isn't big enough for the three of us.
- I know.
- When's the furniture coming?
It's coming tomorrow.
Mommy, is it a school day?
Indeed, it is.
- I want my red dress, Mommy.
- I know you do, honey.
And tomorrow when the truck arrives-
- What?
- My waffle shirt?
- It's coming.
- You sent it on the truck?
Most of the things we shipped.
I gave you one child.
I'm carrying another... presumably yours, so don't take that attitude.
Mommy, I want my red dress.
- I know you do.
- I don't believe I was taking any.
- Well, yes, you were, Robert.
- Okay, my plaid shirt.
- Is it a school day, Mommy?
- Yes, darling.
I told you it is.
It is, I believe, in the wash.
I wish it was Saturday.
Well, it was Saturday.
And it will be again.
Bob.
- Bob, it's dirty.
- The shirt is dirty, Kim.
I said, have a good day.
It's coming tomorrow.
The stress of moving getting to you?
- How was your weekend?
- Good weekend.
Not long enough.
Made a call.
Expect your furniture delivery.
- Kim says it's coming tomorrow.
- Got a small but good surprise.
Made a couple of calls.
It's coming this morning.
- Well, that's real good of you.
- Glad to do it.
Hey, is Jonas sleeping in?
Oh, honey.
Jonas went out with the team last Friday night.
Jonas- he left with the team?
Have a good morning.
Betty Blue.
Betty Blue.
Betty Blue.
Betty Blue.
China Bird in sight.
- Eighty meters to the south.
- We have the overwatch.
Down you go.
Let's go down to the end of the town and back in time for tea.
- How are they doing?
- You're awfully chatty today, aren't you, boss?
Just ask 'em.
Betty Blue.
Betty Blue.
Sitrep?
Out in two minutes.
The satellite appears to be intact.
Fellas, you're about to have some company.
- You got him?
- In range in a few seconds.
Get the satellite component and get out of there.
Go.
Go, go.
Done.
Hold tight.
They've got the component.
I'm not leaving without it.
Alpha team?
No longer at this address.
- You Brown?
- Where are they?
- Deployment.
You Brown?
- Yeah.
I believe this note is for you.
- Sergeant?
- Oh, yeah, slim.
Jonas wanted you to suss out combat loading.
10-by pallets, C-130, for transport by-
This don't involve no danger today... but it is gonna give you a bit of an education.
- He wanted me to load this pallet?
- Well, yeah.
It's not as romantic as jumping out of aircraft and all... but I think you'll find it has its charms.
To begin with, define combat loading for me.
Well, no.
Your little friends ain't here.
But I'm here, and I'm gonna teach you a whole new lovely thing.
Didn't you join the army to learn?
What's combat loading?
Combat loading is the loading of a pack, pallet, aircraft, ship... or any other conveyance to maximize combat readiness at the point of debarkation.
That's right.
You want to put the ammunition... so that it is first off, before the dartboards.
That's correct.
And that's a good start.
Now your task is to take this manifest... and under my intermittent supervision, load this pallet... using at all times your powers of deduction.
Create a perfect combat loading assault mission... against an entrenched position- night, tropical.
Off you go.
Hey, I thought your team was on deployment.
Stay down!
- We're taking fire.
- They hit anything vital?
- Negative.
- Well, then stop complaining.
Slow our friends up a bit, will you?
- Oh, boss.
Look who we have here.
- Who?
Patrick Collins.
Of the terrorist watch list?
Why is he chasing us instead of planning his next anthrax attack?
Well, a Chinese military satellite would pay for quite a few misdeeds.
Betty Blue.
Betty Blue.
Stand by.
There's been a change in plan.
You ready for a little bit of theatrics?
Sun's coming down hard, boss.
We could lose 'em in 10 minutes.
Don't want to lose 'em.
We got Patrick Collins on our tail.
And I want to hand him to the president personally.
- We're gonna drag the wing.
You listening?
- Affirmative.
We're gonna make 'em think we're wounded and thirsty.
- We'll skew the truck around like they took out a tire.
- What?
I said, we'll skew the truck around like they took out a tire and stop.
Is my husband happy in his work?
Well, you know, the problem is stress.
But the stress is mine.
What we have here?
This is a photograph of a broken mirror.
And you're saying that some stressed-out person fired those two shots into the mirror?
- Yes.
I did.
- You fired those shots?
- Yes, I did.
- At a rat?
- At a rat, yes.
- And you missed the rat, but you grouped two shots?
.45 pistol, two shot group, both in the kill zone, with your husband's pistol?
My husband's pistol, yes.
Does that complete our requirements for today?
Tell me again.
Just two people sittin' in a room.
Is that what we are,Jimmy?
I'm not compelled to attend this meeting?
Failure to comply being grounds for my husband's dismissal from the Unit?
Shots fired in an on-base residential community.
- Tell me again.
- Jonas came back from a mission.
He unholstered his pistol, laid it on top of the bureau.
- He went in to take a shower.
- Uh-huh.
And I came into the bedroom.
- And I saw the largest rat anyone's ever seen scurrying-
- Up the wall.
And I picked up the pistol, and I cranked off two shots.
You fired those shots, not your husband?
- That's right.
- Would you lie to cover for your husband?
- Of course.
- Are you lying now?
Of course not.
All right.
Sergeant, I have a message from your wife.
Thank you, Mandy.
- Sergeant Brown.
- Yes, Colonel.
Sergeant, this is Special Agent Griffiths.
He's representing the F.B.I., pursuant to your actions... on the assault and recapture of a hijacked airliner, Wyndam, Idaho.
Sir, I, uh-
I don't
- I don't deserve any special recognition for that mission.
- The entire team-
- No, no, no, son.
We aren't here to decorate you.
The government's deciding whether or not to prosecute... you and your pals for violating a direct order... by assaulting that hijacked airplane without authorization.
You are entitled to an attorney.
Get your mission notes and a fresh set of clothes, and meet us in the Cave in an hour.
- There's nothing wrong with you?
- No.
- Or with the baby?
- No.
- Don't you ever do this again.
- What?
It's kind of a rough day at the shop, huh?
- I beg your pardon.
- That's fine.
That's fine.
I don't appreciate it.
And I
- If you are well- if the baby is well do not- do not-
- What are you talking about?
If you can't deal with some delayed furniture-
What-What-What do you think I'm doing at work?
What do you-
- And I get that message?
- What message?
I'm trying to work.
Do you understand that?
I understand.
I don't understand why you're screaming at me.
I'm not screaming at you.
I'm informing you.
I never, absent catastrophic circumstances...
- want to receive this message.
- What message?
"Come home. "
- I just-
- No, I'm not interested.
Well, if you're not interested, then don't come home until you are interested.
And don't you dare ever speak to me... in that way again!
They're dry.
Where's the nearest water source?
West, 15 minutes.
- Fill the jerricans.
- That dog won't hunt.
Take a look.
They plugged us for real.
We're down to canteens.
Great.
Collins will come at us the back way.
Grey,you ready with those?
A little artistry.
How long till party time?
They aren't but a few minutes out.
Gentlemen, don't shoot the white guy.
He's our little gift to Washington.
Don't shoot the white guy.
Don't shoot the white guy.
Just a few questions, Sergeant...
- regarding your comments on the assault on the plane.
- Yes, sir.
Now this is a contemporary account?
I
- I don't understand.
You wrote it at the time of the assault?
I wrote my notes on the flight back.
And you were not aware that your unit conducted an unlicensed... in fact, illegal assault on the said airliner?
With respect, sir, the actions of my unit saved the lives of-
You were aware that until the suspension of the Posse Comitatus Act... any independent action taken by your unit was a violation of the law?
Did you indicate, sir, that I'm entitled to the services of an attorney?
- Do you have something to conceal, Sergeant?
- Sir, I do not.
- Then why would you wish an attorney?
- Are you an attorney, sir?
Just answer my questions.
Here we go.
Return fire.
Return fire.!
They shot our guy.
Get me out of the line of fire.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Well, how about that?
Cease fire.
Cease fire.
They've got him.
- We want to talk.
- Throw your weapons out.
- Come out with your hands over your head.!
- We want to bargain.!
I don't see that you got anything to bargain with!
We've disabled your truck, and we're between you and the water source.
Come out, or we will come in and kill you.
You advance on us, I will shoot the European!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Hold your fire.
I said I'd kill him!
- Why should I care?
- You didn't kill him, eh?
You didn't kill him.
Then why'd you lure us here?
- You want him!
- I don't know what you're talking about.
All right.
You don't care?
You want him dead?
- I'll shoot him.
- Nope, hold on.
That's better.
- I'll trade him to you.
- For what?
For the piece from the satellite.
My things were supposed to arrive tomorrow.
Made a call to a fella who made a call.
That's the army way.
- But it's the wrong furniture.
- And that's the army way too sometimes.
I've been on the phone all day instead of signing up for college classes as I'd planned.
- Sorry, ma'am.
- No.
It's not your fault.
- Well, hon, it isn't my fault.
- I'm not saying that.
- I understand.
You're trying to help.
- Let me make another call.
Please, don't.
I must beg you.
It's not-
Who is it?
It's Keisha Holmes.
- Her husband's in the regular army.
- It's Randy.
He's in the airborne.
I forget where.
Oh, no.
Keisha Holmes.
We know them.
I know them.
We could use a little more artistry about now.
I want to drive out ofhere with Collins and the component.
Can you remove the contents without destroying the data and leave the box intact?
Give me your watch.
You're a smart cookie, ain't ya?
- You mean for a black man?
- I mean, even for a black man.
But I can't give up the satellite component, and you know that.
Then I can't give you our prisoner.
We want him.
But we don't want him that bad.
That's not what your newspapers say.
Don't let them take me.
Drive me back to Abu Qir.
They'll ransom me.
Friend, I don't think you can live that long.
You want to talk, we'll talk!
- If not?
- If not, we'll kill him.
Then we'll come down and have a little chat... with you.
Then he dies too.
You choose.!
He's gonna cheat you.
What do you want with the satellite anyway?
Did he tell you something?
What do you want with it?
If you can sell it, I can.!
It's not mine to sell or trade.
It belongs to my government now.
How much longer?
Wait one.
Oh, no.
N
- N-No.
N-
- She's just gonna take him for a little walk, Keisha.
- No.
I want all of you women out of my house, right now.
Keisha, we called the pastor.
I don't want the pastor.
I don't-
I don't want your company.
I don't want you.
Now, please.
Please.
Where was he stationed?
In Iraq.
- Was it his first?
- It was his second deployment.
We know them from Bragg.
She shouldn't sit alone.
What are you doing here?
Well, the last time I saw you, Keisha... you borrowed my yellow blouse.
You forgot to give it back.
You forgot to give it back.
You remember, hon?
Where were you going that day?
You were going to meet Randy.
I'm so sorry.
That's right.
Shh.
Were you aware that prior to suspension of the Posse Comitatus Act... any military action taken by your unit was in violation of the law?
With respect, sir, I wish you had been with us.
Hell, you can screw with me in here if it diverts you... but be assured, you will pay the price.
You have said I'm entitled to an attorney.
Say the word, and I'll supply one.
All right then.
Were you aware you were in violation of the law?
The situation, with respect, sir, was in flux.
What is in flux, soldier, is your freedom.
- A crime has been committed.
- We were in contact with the enemy, sir.
Your friends have committed a crime as well.
I'd like to speak to them now.
Sir, I believe the other members of the team are listed in your report.
- Yes.
Where are they?
- Sir, they are otherwise engaged.
But you admit to actually participating in the assault on the airliner?
- In the assault upon the airliner, no.
- But-Wait.
I was in the woods, neutralizing the terrorist spotters.
But you were present when the decision was made to assault the airplane?
- No, sir.
I was in the woods.
- Per his orders.
And where is the team that did the actual assaulting of the aircraft?
- They've been deployed.
- For how long?
I'm afraid that's classified, sir.
Why?
When's your report due?
End of the week.
You know, I'm looking at his picture... but I can't see anything.
Keisha, you're in shock.
I know what it is.
You know, Kim, you remember when we were at Bragg?
- Yes, I do.
- And that, uh
- What was her name?
- Trisha Galloway.
- And she had those mirrors.
Did you know that?
- What mirrors?
- But you know who I meant?
- Yes.
- And she-You remember... she had these mirrors set up in the house so that at any point...
- she could-
- I remember.
see the condolence assistance officers if they came up the walk.
- I remember.
- So she wouldn't be caught.
So she wouldn't be caught unaware.
And I thought, well, that poor woman has had too much.
- I remember, darling.
- But you don't know!
You don't know, Kim.
Bob came back from Iraq.
- That's right.
He did.
- Both times he came back.
- Yes, he did.
- What is he doing now?
The 303rd Logistical Studies.
And what is that?
They just- In effect, he's sort of a clerk.
Yeah, so you- you don't know.
You don't know, Kim, what it does to have a man forever in combat.
Forever in combat, Kim, because-
- That's right.
I don't know.
- Forever in combat.
You forget.
You think you remember, but you don't know... because- because you're out of it now.
That's right.
I'm out of it.
And I'm out of it now too.
Keisha.
Come here.
No.
We can't know what they're going through.
It's okay.
All right.
I'm gonna tell you what.
The European- is he still alive?
- He's alive.
- Show me.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
- No.
- Go!
- All right!
- Now, show me the satellite piece.!
And we'll need one of yourjeeps.!
I'm not your travel agent.
Get your own ride back.
You have twojeeps.
You don't need them both.
The trade is the European for the component and a jeep.
- We're all ready.
- Did I say the trade was done?
I said it!
The satellite and one of your trucks... or the man dies!
Bring it out.
Let's go.
That's close enough.
He'll cheat you.
Do I look like a fool?
Hallel.
Test it.
It's active.
Go.
We drive off now.
If you're gonna go, go.
How long you figure to make the rendezvous?
Easy 40 minutes of driving.
Let's get on it.
I know some people want to talk to you.
A few things to answer for over the years.
A few friends of yours they'd like to find.
Truck's dead.
They put a lucky shot through the engine block.
- Truck's dead?
- Yes, boss.
It is.
We gave them our only working jeep?
Nice.
All right, we're going to the fallback.
Fallback rendezvous is... 19 miles.
I want to see the hot box with the satellite component in it.
I figure the truck has a stretcher.
If not, rig one.
Full canteens.
Fill 'em up, drink up, ruck up.
How's our friend holding?
Lost a lot of blood.
I can stabilize him... but peritonitis is almost certain.
How'd you fool the Geiger counter?
Save your strength.
They accepted the box from the satellite, but, of course, the box is empty.
You crushed up your watches, threw 'em in the box.
Radium from the dials set the Geiger counter off.
19 miles.
10 hours.
We got some hard, dry traveling to do.
Let's get to it.
I just need you to sign this form swearing to the truthfulness of your statement.
How's his appetite?
His appetite?
I thought we were talking about myself.
Of course.
That's right.
His appetite's fine, by the way.
Is he under a lot of stress?
Darlin', these men are under all the stress from the day they log in till the day they retire.
That's not, as I understand it, abnormal psychologically.
That's real.
You see your husband takes it easier if you can, when you can.
- It's always good to see you, Molly.
- Thank you, Doctor.
You think retirement is the only thing that'd relieve the stress?
- What?
- The only thing to lessen stress is to retire.
- That's not what I said.
- Well,you-
You're not gonna put that on the form.
Jimmy, don't put that on the form.
I'm not gonna put anything on his form.
Why would I when we're talking about you?
That's right.
- He been talking about retirement?
- Lord, what have I done?
- We finished here, sir?
- Yes, we're finished.
Colonel?
This isn't over.
Thank you for your time, sir.
That's all.
Thank you, Sergeant.
- You got something on your mind?
- No, sir.
No, I didn't throw you to the wolves, son.
In technical terms, what I did was let you draw fire.
You boys took down the plane.
Everybody knows that.
Well done.
Hurrah.
But you ticked off the F.B.I., who had to file a report to save face.
Let 'em save face.
The bulk of the team's out of town because I sent them out.
You never set foot on their blessed aircraft.
Let 'em talk to you.
You savvy?
Sir, might you have told me beforehand it was all a show?
Hell, no.
Son, you're a hothead.
As time goes by,you'll probably grow out of it.
But today, that's what I was looking for.
I wanted you angry and indignant.
Wheels within wheels, young Sergeant.
Good work.
Now get the hell out ofhere.
Government man's wasted one day of mine, he's never coming back... and I've got work to do.
All right, ho.
- Three minutes.
- We don't need it, boss.
I didn't say you need it.
Just said do it.
How much longer on the stretcher?
We got a half hour to rendezvous.
Or it's all academic.
Why don't you leave me here?
Because I'm taking you in.
You're taking me in.
But you didn't take me.
Drink this.
The drug's gonna dry you out.
You didn't take me.
I didn't take you, but I got you.
They shot me, and they gave me up.
How about that?
Compass is swinging wild.
Two compasses, two different readings.
Pick the one swings freer.
Predominate wind's from the north.
Rocks pitted on the north face.
2-8 degrees true will be about- about there.
All right.
Coffee break's over.
One, two, three.
- I put a rocket under 'em.
- About what?
I'm lost.
About the furniture for Brown.
You called about his furniture?
Did you have a hard day today, Molly, with Jonas being away?
- Evening, Mrs. Gerhardt.
- Good evening, Colonel.
Just picking up some groceries for Keisha Holmes.
Yeah, I heard.
I'm sorry.
Was there something else you wanted to ask me?
No.
I thought there was something you wanted to ask me.
- About?
- About Dr. Willey- my meeting with him about stress.
Is there something you want to tell me went on with the doctor?
Can't think of a thing.
Besides, you'll see it in the report.
- 'Cause ifJonas needs a break, I'll staff him.
- Staff him?
Put him on the intel staff right here.
- My husband isn't going to fly a chair.
- If he needs it.
What he needs is what you need.
For him to be with his team.
- Thank you, Molly.
- Tom.
Let's get out of here.
Send from Blue team:
"Mission accomplished.
"Additional package on board.
Priority five.
Requires medevac, security, interrogators. "
Uh, "Code is"- Help me.
What's his code name?
His code name is Westwind, boss.
Do we want to put it on the air?
If they ask who we have... respond:
"We have somebody you've been looking for. "
How's he doing?
He's alive.
Won't be walking for six months, but-
Nice watch.
It was my father's.
I never was big on loot.
Friendly gesture.
But I doubt they'll let me keep it.
Well, that's between you and them, friend.
That fight may go on.
But between you and me... it's over.
We're done for the day.
Go in and put your pajamas on now, honey.
I'll be in in a minute.
Molly?
- Well done with Keisha.
- Molly, I am sorry I was snippy with you today.
- No need to apologize.
- Well, yes, there is.
As you were trying to help a woman in need, and...
I criticized you for it.
Child, you impress me.
Mommy?
- Good night.
- Good night.
Go along.
I just came by to get some of my things and I'll-
When is my bed gonna come?
- Serena, it's not important.
- Yes, it is.
- I beg your pardon?
- Why don't you go brush your teeth for Daddy, huh?
- Look, I'm so-
- I never called you to say come home.
I called to say "call home. "
- Your precious army garbled the transmission.
- I'm sorry.
I called to say the furniture has not arrived... so maybe you'd like to take us out to dinner.
- Mm-hmm.
- That's what I called to say.
Mom, can I sleep with you and Dad tonight?
- Uh-
- Maybe not tonight, honey.
How was your day?
Molly Blane, calling about the Holmes funeral.
- Uh, yeah.
Short notice.
- Yes.
Hello, Captain.
No, I'd like to.
It's, uh, been a hard day here.
- Are your kids at your mother's?
- Yeah.
For another hour or two.
I want to see you.
Can you meet me there in 10 minutes?
- Sure.
- Good.
Well, you have a good night too, Gina.
Keisha Holmes, 243 Normandy, Belleau Woods.
Widow of Staff Sergeant Randall Holmes, mother of Daniel.
She'll require eight seats at the memorial.
Her mother, stepfather, and a party of six.
I advise six additional seats.
Yes.
They always do.
I know he doesn't rate a live bugler.
I understand.
But I'd be much obliged if you could.
Thank you, Captain.
I appreciate it.
I, uh- I'm having trouble breathing.
Thank you.
Will they use torture on me?
- I don't think so.
- But you're not sure?
- It's against the law.
- Oh, I see.
Torture is against the law.
Prop you up a little bit.
This is where you end too, isn't it?
Is it?
Some variation.
Is it where I end?
I expect so.
Well, we've both had a long run... haven't we?
Will you tell me your name?
No.
Can't do it, friend.
I'd like to know the name of the man who finally caught me.
I didn't catch you.
Your people gave you up.
- Easy.
- Mmm.
And, uh, I'd like something to eat.
Sure.
Gonna grab him some food.
That guy- is he who I think he is?
That's who he is.
That's some story for the bar.
I'm sure they'll talk to you about that when we land.

- Hi, who's this?
- It's Ivy.
Why are you still calling me?
Where are you?
Don't bother me with secular matters.
- Go to hell!
- Same to you.
If that can solve anything, I'll be a monk.
- You'll burn in hell.
- Mind your language, dear.
It's an enhanced Siemens 304, refitted with infrared rays.

Hi.
Me again.
Four, eight and three for races three, four and eight,

Recently, I've become enlightened.
One must reach for the sky with limited resources.
Too many women, too little time.
Going after them all... it's a losing game.
Therefore, I have decided to focus only on the wealthy ones.
The only way to get rich is to find a rich wife.
- Yes!
- You think so too?
- Keep going.
- More?
- Go on.
- More?
Go on, go on...
Go on!
- Go on, go on!
- Don't, don't!
- Damn!
Lost by a whisker.
- You'll gamble your life away.
- Get lost.
- lt's opened.
Why didn't you say so?
Not much here.
It hurts!
Relax, Mrs. Li.
You must spread your legs.
Relax, open up.
Open them wide.
What are you doing?
Can't you read?
These laxatives cost $89.
Forget the cheap stuff.
Get Taxol.
They're for chemotherapy, $8,000 each.
Go for these.
Relax.
Now push, harder.
Push harder!
OK.
There we go.
See for yourself, boy or girl?
- Hello.
- We're done.
We're coming down.
Rendezvous outside Block B.

"B" for Boy.
Smart ass!
Block Boy it is.
"B" for Boy.
Act normal.
How?
I look like I'm pregnant, and you look like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Excuse me, tell me...
Don't ask.
Doctors can have humps and pot bellies.
Don't discriminate against the disabled.
Calling Control.
Hello.
Dr. Tsui?
Yes.
There's an emergency?
Run!
Split up.
Don't get caught, and don't spill the beans if you do.
- Hey!
Get out!
- Sorry!
Number three!
Number three!
Sorry.
I should've backed Nine!
I'm sure he'll make it.
Hang in there, Dad.
Pardon me.
Why, Dad?
Why?
Who are you?
Who is he?
Chan.
Sorry.
Wrong ward.
I was looking for a Wong.
I'm so sorry... excuse me.
Sorry.
- Doctor!
- Congratulations, Mrs. Li.
The baby is healthy and cute, 2.8 Kg.
- Really?
Let me...
- Yes.
Here, look how cute he is.
- How's my daughter-in-law?
- She's fine.
Everything went smoothly.
- Here she is.
- Mani!
How are you feeling?
You did great!
Look!
He's so handsome.
- Just like me.
- Well?
Does it hurt?
You must be tired, get some rest.
Get some rest.
So cute!
Back to you, Dr. Lee...
Mani.
They're on the third floor.
Let's take a look.
Max...
Remember what you promised me?
You said... we'll go to Alaska, and get married in a white chapel.
Let's go now.
Marry me.
I'm married to Calvin.
- Give me the baby.
- You don't mean it.
Listen, we're not meant for each other.
- Give me the baby...
- l can change for you!
You're coming with me anyway.
Come back!
Hey, buddy.
The last race.
Back Number Six, not Nine.
- Six?
- Hey, you!
That's my form guide!
Move it!
Hang on, Mani.
You're hurting me.
Give me Mani!
Are you alright?
Max!
Come back!
- Out of the way!
- Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop him by the elevator!
Back off!
Take it easy.
- Stay away!
- Cool it.
Stop all the escalators.
Go away!
First you took Mani, and now my son!
You're no buddy of mine.
- Give me the baby.
- Go away!
Take it easy.
Calm down!
Don't do this.
Mani, leave with me.
We'll raise the kid together.
You're crazy!
Give me my child.
Come with me!
Stop crying!
Calm down!
Stand back.
The baby...
No!
Let's get out of here.
Help her.
Hurry up, go.
- Grab hold of the baby.
- Watch out!
He's falling!
The baby!
Towels!
Get some towels!
Pull me up.
It's alright!
They got him.
Amazing!
Thanks.
Go help the baby!
You dropped the drugs.
I told you to leave them!
There goes your Viagra.
- Go, go!
- Number Nine!
Again.
Whose bet is this?
- What's its capacity?
- This is for kids.
I'm asking you about its engine capacity.
Kids...
Don't worry, I'm just teasing you.
I had my eye on this one.
Here's my deposit.
Prepare the contract.
Ready...
Go!
Got it.
There.
If you can sense a hair, nothing can stop you.

That's impossible.

Keep the change.
Why don't you use your credit card?
That's just her tip.
Credit Card... I'll look around again.
Wait for me at the door, OK?
- That's a discount card from a sushi store.
- l know.
We'll take these too.
Keep the change!
- Stop being a bad loser.
- lf you can't take losing, quit.
Pay me back, or you're dead.
I'll pay you back right away.
Why do you put the money in the refrigerator?
- Why?
- lt's our safe, don't you recognise it?
Honey, we lost our son years ago.
There's no point dwelling on it.
- Thanks.
- This label is fantastic.
But I've ordered something even better for you. lt'll be here soon.
Try this, Miss.
New tissue paper with floral fragrance.
Try the floral fragrance.
Thongs, pay up!
Come back!
MacDaddy!
Hi.
Yeah.
I like talking to you.
Not like your thugs.
All they do is fight.
Do you know why I like to borrow from you?
You have compassion, sympathy and a conscience.
Am I right?
And smart, too.
I'll repay your $1 00,000 loan in 1 00 instalments, OK?
It's a deal.
I hate smooth talkers.
I have a living to make!
Don't come any closer.
MacDaddy, I was just kidding.
- You think this is funny?
- Don't make me jump.
- Go ahead.
- Are you serious?
Jump!
You don't want me dead, do you?
No, but you brought it upon yourself.
- Get a camera and take a picture.
- Yes, Boss.
If I die, you can kiss your money goodbye.
It won't do either of us any good.
No, I think it's brilliant.
I've got so many bad debts lately.
This will show the others.
- Go on, jump.
- No, MacDaddy.
No?
Let's see...
No?
So you can read my mind?
I'm safe!
Come on.
Come and get me!
You!
Take this!
I'll get you, Thongs!
What are you doing, pal?
Fixing the air-conditioning.
It's OK, go back in.
- Look, Boss.
Cops!
- Here they come.
Let's go.
Thongs.
Inspector Mok.
Sorry, I didn't see you.
You say that every time.
You missed the alumni gathering.
Alumni?
Nobody called me.
- No?
- No.
- Grade school or high school?
- Grade school.
Here, you know the drill.
is this really necessary?
No need to leap off a building over a card game.
You're more capable than my Dad.
I'm not even fit to tie his shoelaces.
He's one of the richest men in Asia.
If I'm half the man he is it'd be wonderful.
Dad will like you very much.
I'm sure I'll like him very much too.
And you, of course.
is my English getting better?
I... need to grab a cigar from the car.
Enjoy your dinner.
Yan...
Keep an eye on her.
Stop right there!
What the hell?
What's wrong with you?
You can't come here dressed as a chicken!
Think with your head if you want to spy on me.
- Forget it, I want a divorce.
- l'm working.
I know that.
You'd better not be doing this for fun.
I came because Fanny told me she saw you.
Who's that inside?
Obviously, she's a woman.
Can I only have male clients?
Divorce me if you don't trust me.
You haven't been home for months, I miss you.
Why?
I was stupid enough to marry you at 1 8.
Look at this mess.
I can't breathe.
Never mind, let's divorce.
- l'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
You'd better not have done me wrong!
You should feel sorry for yourself.
Go back to school.
If you knew any better, you wouldn't be dressed like this.
What's the key to a marriage?
Trust.
Space.
I'm suffocating!
- l want a divorce.
- l can't.
- l'm pregnant.
- What?
What?
I'm pregnant.
No way!
When was the last time we...
You were drunk that night and forgot to put one on.
How could you?
You should have kicked me out of bed.
I am ignorant about birth control.
Really!
You know how I am with kids.
I don't like them. lf we have a child, we'll have no more privacy.
Are you sure?
Have you checked?
You can't be more than three months gone.
Don't waste any time.
Get an abortion in Shenzhen.
You can't afford to wait.
I love you.
Now hurry.
Wait.
You can't walk to Shenzhen dressed like that.
Take a bus.
Go back inside...
Tell me where Thongs is.
He's dead.
Don't get upset, mind your health.
It's just the usual...
Some paint and take some pictures.
Shut the door and windows while you eat, OK?
Don't be mad.
Sorry about that.
- Hey, Thongs.
- Stay away from him.
- Come to visit your father?
- Yes.
He's a disgrace to the village, ignore him.
Please move along, lady.
Easy...
Hurry...
What's going on?
- Just leave my family alone.
- But you were in hiding, pal.
How else can we find you?
What are you doing?
Hold on tight!
I'll pay when I can.
I'll kill you if you bother my family again.
Help him up.
What's the occasion?
Everyone is here.
Twins.
Look how tall you are, Ting!
Come, I brought presents.
These are all for you.
Take what you like.
This is for you.
This is for you.
Here's the pillow you wanted.
And your heater.
This is for you, Dad.
A massager to ease your back pains.
Why did you come back?
I thought you were dead!
Stop cursing me like that, Dad.
Look at you, a punk!
You were not like this when you were born.
I wanted you to be a doctor or lawyer.
I sent you to the best schools.
But you turned out to be a loser.
I may not be a lawyer, but I'm still your son.
I wanted to be a professional, too.
Even the President, but I'm not cut out for it.
Your mother and I saved up every dime to put you through school.
I tried, I just can't do it.
Don't be so stubborn.
- Me?
Stubborn?
- l'm doing alright.
Look at me.
The hell you are.
What have you been doing?
Gambling!
- l'm a business man.
- Business?
What business?
Whoring and gambling?
You're a crook.
You're nothing but a cheat.
- All you want is for me to make money.
- Don't start.
I'm making money now.
I bought you everything you wanted.
What's wrong with that?
I earned every penny.
Money isn't everything.
I want you to be an honest man.
I did nothing wrong.
What have I done?
What did I do wrong?
I wonder about these things.
How and where you got them from.
You probably stole them!
Take them away!
- Out!
- Dad!
- Here, throw this away as well.
- Get out!
- You'd better go.
- You're not my son.
I don't have an unworthy son like you.
Nobody wants to see you.
Take them away!
PAY UP!
Honey!
- What is it, Honey?
- ls this our bedroom?
- Yes, of course.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, it's our bedroom.
- We've been robbed!
- What?
- There's been a burglary!
- Goddamn it, who did this?
- lt's OK, Honey.
At least our baby is safe.
I'll clean up this mess, OK?
A burglary!
- Hello.
- Landlord.
- What is it, Uncle?
- l heard you're retiring.
Have you made enough already?
I have a big one for you, interested?
I never said I was retiring. I'll take any job.
Meet for a card game, Thongs.
22:00, the usual place.
- Don't buy a car if you can't afford it.
- Just fooling around.
- This is for your trouble.
- You always make me do this.
- Stop being agitated.
- No.
- Treat yourself to a massage.
- No!
- Come on, take it.
- No!
Be like that, you goddamn midget!
You'll be towing cars for the rest of your life.
And you'll have a midget son just like you!
Did you crack my refrigerator, Octopus?
is Thongs coming?
What time is it?
There's a big job, I can't decide.
I feel we should...
Been painting again?
Must you always wear white?
Did you crack my refrigerator?
Why are you so upset?
The paint is on me!
You should see what I did to those thugs.
What were you saying?
We have an assignment.
I can't make up my mind.
- l'll do anything.
- This is really complicated.
- Though we'll be paid $7 million...
- What?
What?
$7 million?
$7 million?
To do what?
- Just hear me out...
- Cut the crap, let's do it.
- Listen to me...
- l'll do anything for $7 million.
- $7 million, you've got to be kidding!
- Start the car...
Close the door!
Watch where you're going.
Help me.
- Landlord...
- Give me a hand.
- ..you don't have to come with us.
- l must do this myself.
- Why is this such a big deal?
- Never mind.
Just open the door for me, I'll wait down here.
Nothing!
I bet they wore the jewellery.
- Just some foreign currency left.
- You're kidding!
Where's Landlord?
Probably cracking another safe.
Have I seen her before?
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
- Just taking him back to his grandpa.
- Whose grandpa?
- Shut up!
- What?
You lied to me too?
What did you feed him?
- What is it?
- There's a break-in!
Uncle, it's done.
is it Lobster Bay?
Roger that.
Do you know what you're doing?
We agreed no raping, looting arson and murder.
This is someone else's family feud, stay out.
We take the baby to his Grandpa.
All it takes is a few minutes for a blood test.
- What did you feed him?
- Nothing.
- Just a sedative to help him sleep.
- Are you crazy?
You fed a sedative to a baby!
Even burglars have ethics.
You taught us that, remember?
Ethics are for reference only.
We need to improvise all the time.
You should've told us the job involves a baby.
I told you we needed to talk, but once you heard about the $7 million, you pushed me into the car and you even congratulated me.
- You didn't give me a chance.
- No way.
- What are you doing?
- Take him back.
How can you say that?
I dare you to repeat that!
- Take him back!
- Who supported you all these years?
Who supported you all these years?
Who taught you to pick a lock?
And who taught you to crack a safe?
What will you do without me?
You're nothing but a loser.
And you, a womaniser.
I'm sorry, do you know what happened to me?
Do you have any idea?
You know my wife is nuts.
And I can barely see these days.
I'm going blind.
Do you understand?
Know why I had to do this myself?
Why must I do this?
Use your imagination.
Rings any bell?
I've been robbed!
Some bastards cleaned out my $3 million!
I have nothing left...
Who'll support me?
Will you do it?
Can you support me?
Even I get burgled.
I'm supposed to be a pro.
Now I have nothing!
I can manage on my own.
I know I can!
I don't need your help.
Landlord.
Get in.
Let's go home and get some sleep.
If I wasn't driving this piece of shit, you'd be eating my dust.
Get out of the way, asshole!
If I let you overtake me in that car, I'm a real son of a bitch.
Stop this nonsense!
Careful with the kid.
Are you crazy?
Let him pass.
- Hello?
Uncle?
- Are you there yet?
- Almost, and you?
- Five more minutes.
- Some asshole is blocking my path.
- We're duelling with an asshole too.
- Don't be late, the buyer is punctual.
- No problem.
- Be careful and lose that asshole quickly.
- Don't worry.
I'm not nicknamed "King of Monza" for nothing.
See you there!
- Boss.
- l just want to know if the baby is ours.
The others can go to hell.
Listen, only the kid!
Yes, Boss.
Excuse me, sir!
You were speeding.
Please wait here.
See?
What did I tell you?
For everyone's information, my license has been revoked 3 times.
Your license has been revoked?
What's that got to do with being a burglar?
You need to drive the get-away car, pal.
Get ready to swap.
If things go wrong, kill the others.
We only want the kid.
- The hardware's all loaded.
- Brilliant!
Don't suck on it, blow!
Roll down the window, sir.
Roll down the window.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Please open the bag.
What's inside?
- What's inside?
- This bag?
Yes.
Please open it.
- Please, open it up.
- Sure.
Please cooperate, thank you.
- Back up!
I'm holding a gun, damn it!
- Yes, Boss.
Cut the posturing!
They're running the road block.
Give chase!
Go!
Run for it!
Go.
EU to headquarters.
A black sedan just fled from us.
The mini van is getting away.
Send a police van after them.
- Why is it so dark?
- You forgot the lights!
- You call this driving?
- Check the kid.
- The kid?
I held onto him the whole time.
- OK.
- l'm stuck.
- Can you move?
No, don't mind me.
The cops are coming, take the kid.
- To where?
Your place?
- Are you mad?
Don't let my wife see him.
- Where then?
- Just go.
- Hurry, the cops are coming.
- They're coming...
- l'll get out in a few days.
- Take care.
Go!
Control!
Traffic accident in Sai Kung.
Send an ambulance, someone's hurt.
And a fire truck.
Over!
We don't have the kid and we can't find Uncle.
I want that kid!
I want that kid!
If you can't find him, prepare for your own funeral.
Yes, Boss.
We'll fix it.
He hasn't stopped crying.
- What do you want?
- Just tell us.
- Humour him.
- You do it.
No, you do it!
Hurry!
- Shut up!
Don't wake Landlady.
- What now?
- What are you doing?
- Putting him to sleep.
- You'll kill him!
- What else can we do?
Let's close the windows.
Close the other one.
What the hell do you want?
- Hey!
What are you doing?
- He's fine, I left breathing space.
Where's your common sense?
You'll kill him, he's just a baby.
- He'll be fine, I just want to muffle his noise.
- How can he be fine?
Hey, it works!
Carry on.
It's working!
Keep it up.
Yes!
Having fun?
Keep it up!
Try something else, you're getting boring.
- Now try another trick.
- You didn't lock the door.
- What a surprise, Landlady!
- Landlady?
I heard a baby's cry.
Pretend that you're doing laundry.
is there a baby?
- No
- No?
Bite your tongue!
Where's my baby?
Don't you bully him.
There's your baby.
- What a sucker!
- Where's my Honey?
Where is he?
Landlord?
Where's my Honey?
Where is he?
- He's gone to eat fondue.
- What kind of fondue?
Where?
- Shenzhen.
- For how long?
- A month...
No, a week.
- A week?
That'll kill him.
Stop!
Landlady!
- Baby!
- Landlady!
Landlord is having fondue, for a day only, not a week.
He's there to close a deal.
- A big one.
He'll be back soon.
- Yes...
I think he told me.
- That's right.
- Look!
It's filthy!
I'll clean up.
I'll do it!
It'll attract cockroaches, I know.
- And here...
- l'll do it.
- l'll do it.
It's getting late.
You should go to bed.
- Clean up this mess.
- Sure, we'll clean the whole place up.
- Don't forget your laundry.
- Bye.
Where's the kid?
- Damn!
It won't stop!
- Pull the plug!
Please don't cry!
I'm begging you.
I'll offer you a sacrifice.
- Damn!
Forgot to light it.
- Here's some chicken, it's great.
- Please don't cry.
- Babies don't eat chicken.
Please stop crying.
Pity my ear-drums!
Have some chicken!
I'll knock him out with this.
- Give him a beer.
He'll sleep better drunk.
- Drumstick?
Twinkle, twinkle little star How I wonder what you are lt's working!
Keep it up!
Keep singing.
Sing anything, hurry!
Hurry!
Fatso marries an expensive wife.
We sharks are circling him left and right.
With interest multiplying day by day.
Our future has never looked so bright.
- You call that a song?
- Then you do it.
Wait!
Let me strike my Elvis pose.

We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year
And a Happy New Year...
This is local news on the hour.
There was a break-in at Tycoon Li's Peak mansion.
Excuse me, officer. I need a favour.
I have a request.
Hello?
Turn on the TV, Thongs.
Now!
Thanks.
According to the latest financial reports the Li family's net worth is well over $50 billion.
See that?
He's not a mongrel.
He's a pedigree poodle.
It's not regular price anymore.
I'll jack it up when I get out.
How long will it take?
A week at the most.
I'm charged with dangerous driving.
2 weeks tops.
What?
Who'll look after him?
No one except you, understand?
Wait till I get out.
Bye-bye!
A week!
My God!
It's not on!
Quiet!
Again?
What now?
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing?
- lt stinks!
- l don't believe this.
He didn't even have much to eat.
Don't shove it to me!
There's shit everywhere.
Eat this, come on.
Yeah, good boy.
Baby!
Baby!
Don't feed him just anything.
How old is he?
- How old?
- Yes!
- How old?
- 5 to 6 months, I can tell.
- Who's the father?
- He is.
I see. I know your kind.
Yes, that's what we are.
Don't worry, I have nothing against your kind.
But men are so careless.
Not this!
This is for 3 year-olds.
No, this one doesn't have DHA.
This is extra large!
His pee will leak from the side.
No!
This is for breast enlargement.
- l need that, he wants a better feel.
- Don't complicate matters, just hurry!
Life is complicated.
You are what you eat.
What you feed and teach him will stay with him for life.
You must take this seriously.
You should come to a lesson.
- l'll show you.
- Enough!
Just hurry!
- Whose napkins are these?
- Napkins?
One with wings and one without.
One for day, one for night, which is it?
- l want night time with no wings.
- Day time with wings for me.
Hurry!
- Ready?
- Yes!
Drink this!
is it too thick?
- This is it.
- Hurry.
Thanks!
We'll each take a class.
Alright!
Thanks.
Over there, sir!
Help me please!
1 , 2, 3.
Sit down and relax.
- l don't get it, can you show me again?
- Carry on.
Go home and teach your wife.
Keep your back straight.
Tighten your thighs and buttocks.
- Straighten the back?
- Yes.
- ls this straight enough?
- Look!
It's straight.
Keep it flat and straight.
- He's so cute!
- Yes!
- How old is he?
- A few months, I think.
- A few months?
He's big.
- Where's his mother?
- At work.
- You take care of him yourself?
That's great!
So cute and loveable.
- You're not local?
- l'm from Shaanxi.
A student nurse on exchange.
Octopus!
I don't believe my luck.
How can he miss out by a whisker?
I should have known better.
Isn't it fun?
Can you believe this?
Thanks so much, Melody.
If not for you we wouldn't know what to do with him.
Octopus and I are grateful.
Actually, I'm very grateful.
So that's how he was revived.
Yan.
Did you do what I told you to do?
You don't have to go if you're busy.
Should I call her?
Was I too harsh?
This is Yan, I can't come to the phone right now.
Leave a message at the beep.
- Alan!
- Long time no see, Thongs.
- Your baby?
- Hey, stop it!
- Carry on!
- Come.
Be a good boy!
Don't do that!
Thongs, what's your game?
Get out if you're not playing!
Don't bring a kid in here!
Get lost!
Life is complicated.
You are what you eat.
What you feed and teach him will stay with him for life.
You must take this seriously.
- Thongs, are you in or not?
- Go home and baby-sit!
- Get lost!
- l'm not playing.
Loser!
- Cleaned out already?
- No, he was crying too much.
You're worse than my Dad!
I really don't know.
I've been calling Landlord all night.
I'm a man of my word.
I'll fix it for you.
I just want the boy!
Let me out!
is this a joke?
Landlord has 2 partners in crime.
Thongs and Octopus.
Let me out!
Thongs and Octopus.
I don't care what you do, find them.
I found them, Boss.
They're inside.
Very good!
Now we change the diaper.
Hey, are you Thongs?
Give me the baby.
- What baby?
- Don't play dumb.
- l don't know any Uncles.
- Don't play dumb with me.
- What is it?
- They're looking for Baby.
My name is Baby, looking for me?
Damn!
You're asking for it!
Go!
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, I just over jumped.
- What did they say?
- Who cares?
Let's go.
- Remember?
- Yes.
You ring the doorbell, and when he opens I'll splash the paint on your cue.
- Let him have it!
- Yes.
Wait!
Thongs, don't hide behind women and babies.
I won't spare you!
I don't understand a word you're saying.
- Thongs is my buddy.
- He's not here right now, come back later.
OK, we'll wait inside.
He's my kid brother.
- Wait!
- Nice to meet you.
Wait!
There's no one here.
Fanny, I'm scared.
is it worse than an abortion?
Asking him about the future?
Confront him with the ultrasound.
Be good.
Who are you looking for?
Octopus.
He is not here, he'll be back later.
You'd better come in.
Thongs.
Make sure the baby is home.
- What's that look on your face?
- Toothache.
- Why is Octopus off in such a hurry?
- He needs to use the toilet.
- Do you live here?
- Yes.
- l'd love to come up for a chat.
- Steve!
Octopus!
Thongs!
You've finally shown up!
I'm tired of leaving messages on your voicemail.
Leave!
You two, get out!
Come here.
- Where's the baby?
- ln your room.
Who are they?
Decorators.
My flat is a mess.
What's with the paint?
We're renovating, just trying out the colours.
What is it, Yan?
Oh, no!
Talk to the officer.
What is it, Miss?
Thongs!
The police can help you with any problem.
There's a cop in there!
Go to the roof.
Sit down and tell me your problem.
Meet my good friend, Inspector Steve Mok.
He's my... cousin.
He's my... other cousin.
We came to show him the colour sample.
- Your face...
- l'm into body art.
What's with all the baby stuff?
You know my pal Octopus.
He's a born womaniser.
He got someone pregnant.
- Can't do much about that.
- Where is he now?
- ln the toilet.
- l need to go too.
- You do?
- l'm investigating a break-in.
- Do you know anything about it?
- l quit a long time ago.
Octopus.
Inspector wants to have a word with you.
Hurry up.
- Octopus.
What took you so long?
- You're here?
- Your turn.
- Not after him, it stinks in there.
- Do you have a friend in there.
- Friend?
He's my cousin too.
I'm the eldest.
Then let's reminisce.
- You've never met each other?
- Of course they have.
Take care of this, Octopus.
Why are you still here?
Get out of my sight!
What the hell is this?
If you want to stay, then I'll leave.
You...
And you...
- lt sounds complicated.
- Yes, very complicated.
Thongs, we've been friends for so long, I didn't know you have cousins of different races.
My Dad was a sailor...
He must have stopped in India.
That'll make him your brother.
That's not right.
- Maybe the sailor was his Grandfather.
- Or his mother's father.
What's the matter with you?
- What's wrong?
- l have occasional muscle spasms.
Muscle spasms?
- Well?
- Cramps?
You're probably possessed!
Give me a hand.
A baby!
Hold on.
Help me, Thongs!
Give us a hand!
- l'd like to...
- l can bite!
Catch!
Beat it!
You won't get away with this!
You have a lot of nerve, Thongs.
Hurry up!
- Oh no!
- They're inside, go get them!
Mind your head!
You're so greedy.
- Listen to me, Steve.
- You can confess at the station.
- l'll turn myself in afterwards.
- Who'd believe you?
- Are you alright?
- Just worry about yourself!
- Don't hit my head.
- Thongs!
Stay back!
Should have listened to me.
I'll get you, Thongs!
- Octopus!
- Run!
Come back!
Alright, alright.
Get up!
After the truck!
Stop!
Police!
I need to use your bike!
Go!
What?
It's not mine.
I'm on learner's permit.
I'll ask the Commissioner to grant you a proper license!
Go!
- Really?
- Yes!
Mind if I ask what did you use to drive?
I'm just a video gamer!
Someone is tailing us.
Looks like a robber to me.
In broad daylight?
Now what?
Don't worry, call Headquarters.
Ask for back up.
Come in, Headquarters.
This is 3321 , Daniel calling.
- Suspected robbery in progress!
- Stop the car, kid!
Who are you calling a kid?
I can tell that you're a thief!
- Having fun?
I'll ram your butt!
- Move closer!
Easy.
Slow down a bit.
What?
Another one?
- On a motorbike?
- Stop the truck!
Stop.
He's cute!
Hop over!
The Commissioner will be in touch.
Bye!
That way!
After him!
- Free the pushchair!
- Do you think I'm sunbathing?
Almost there!
Move closer!
- Stop!
- Turn!
Turn, ram him!
Thank God!
Watch out!
You call yourself a driver?
Thank God!
That was close.
Everything's fine.
Back up was quick!
Thanks to you.
- Where are you from?
- l'm from Brokebrook Mountain.
I'm a cop, kid.
I need to use your bike.
You're nuts.
I dare you to say that again.
- Everything is taken care of, keep in touch.
- Thanks.
This is Octopus, if you need me, leave a message after the tone.
"lou" Let's pay off Thongs' debts.
Don't worry, Dad.
Here's my contribution.
Uncle, what happened to you?
You've turned into an ice-lolly.
Boss, I can explain...
We're men of honour.
We never renege.
We always keep our word.
Never break a promise.
One for all, and all for you!
- $30 million.
- Thirty... million...
That's my offer, take it or leave it.
Money is nothing between you and me.
Who is it?
- lt's me.
- You're home!
- Who's the kid?
He's crying like crazy.
- Check him out for me.
Well?
You need to change him and he's running a fever.
- Fever?
- Yes!
- What shall I do?
- Take him to a doctor.
- Take him to a doctor?
- Hurry!
- Landlord?
- l'm free.
- Thank God for that.
- Where are you now?
- On my way to the hospital.
- Hospital?
What happened?
- The baby is sick.
- Tell Octopus to meet us there.
Thongs?
Be careful, Dad.
- What happened?
- l called you about Dad's stroke.
You were too busy to care.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Take good care of Dad.
Are you alright?
The fever broke.
The doctor said he'll be fine.
- Thanks.
- You don't have to worry.
- l...
- You don't have to explain.
No matter what, you saved his life.
- Wait here, I'll get his prescription.
- Thanks.
Hurry.
Now that you're here, let's talk.
Do you know how much more I have bargained for you for this poodle?
I give you 3 guesses.
$30 million!
$30 million!
This $5 million is just the deposit.
We deliver in 3 hours and we get $25 million more!
It's too good to be true.
Give him this glucose later.
It's not necessary, now that his fever broke.
What?
You two have become nannies now?
It can't be.
What is this?
Three Ferraris.
What are you thinking?
Your own casino, bigger than Monte Carlo.
Come on!
Give us a chance.
No matter what you want, we'll do it.
Just don't hurt our baby.
There's nothing to watch on TV.
Do you think she'll recognise him?
You're worried she'll recognise the baby?
This baby is barely... I need some fresh air.
There are hundreds born everyday.
They all look the same.
She won't be able to tell, understand?

Hello.
Darling. I'm sorry.
I don't deserve to be your husband.
So long.
Here you are, Madam.
- Honey!
- Darling!
Silly, why the tears?
You called from a hospital.
What's going on?
- Are you OK?
- l'm fine, dear.
- What happened to your glasses?
- l got run over by a bike on my way here and cracked the lenses.
Get me a new pair tomorrow.
Good girl.
Now close your eyes.
I have something for you.
No peeking.
Take a step back.
Honey, here's something you'll cherish.
Ready...
Lower your arm.
Right, now the other one.
Now open your eyes.
Not so loud, you'll scare him.
Baby...
Mummy missed you.
Honey...
Have I been a burden to you?
Don't be silly.
You made me very happy.
You're my most precious darling.
Not so loud, you're waking him.
Good baby.
I'm returning him tomorrow.
I have sorted out the baby formula.
So nice to be a baby.
Eat, sleep, drink and shit.
So happy and without a care in the world.
Right?
Right!
Why do you trust me?
You know I'm a burglar, still you made friends with me.
Actually...
The first time I saw you I knew you had a conscience.
If you have a chance to start over, will you still be a burglar?
It's too late for that now.
You can start from this very second, it's never too late.
Look at me.
Look me in the eye.
I've faith in you.
It's Mummy.
- Daddy...
- Cut it out!
Mummy.
Daddy...
Daddy, do you know his name?
Why do you want to know?
Just curious what will happen.
What do you think will happen to him?
- Hello.

Bring the kid.
Someone will fetch you in five minutes.
Wait here!
Open the gate!
Where is he?
Give me the baby!
Thirty... million...
Give me the baby.
Listen.
Feed him milk every 4 hours.
Check the temperature with the back of your hand or you'll scald him, understand?
Also, everyday at noon...
He needs his orange juice, got it?
He chokes easily since he has no teeth even crushed fruits will choke him.
- lf you feed him solid food, you must chew...
- Don't be such a nag!
Hold him with your left arm or he'll cry.
Give him congee in the afternoon.
Chop up some lean pork, finely diced.
Not too cold, not too hot.
Serve in two separate bowls.
- OK, OK.
Just hand him over.
- Alright.
- Be careful.
- l will.
Here, take this bottle too.
The temperature is right.
- l got it...
- Don't rock him too hard.
- lt's time to feed him.
- Enough.
I wonder if he'll survive the night.
What are you staring at?
Get lost.
- Come on, let's go.
- What are you doing?
Don't worry.
They have doctors and nurses, he'll be fine.
It's just a family squabble.
They're taking take him to his Grandpa.
Think about your Ferrari and your casino.
Come on!
Come on!

Good boy.

- Yes, sir!
Oh my God!
Baby!

- Mummy.
- Don't move, I'm coming up!
- Mummy.
Stay right there.
I'm here.
Baby.
Baby!
- Daddy.
- lt's not funny!
Great job, Thongs!
You deserve a kiss!
Don't hurt the baby, morons!
Daddy!
Run, Daddy!
Hurry up and get in!
Isn't it fun?
Then let's continue.
Get the kid!
Send the other cars!
Don't worry.
I'll get it back for you.
Thongs!
I only want the boy!
Come out... ..or I'll drop him!
We all die sooner or later.
It's a matter of going in style.
Take the baby and go.
Don't mind me!
I doubt if he'll drop me.
Thongs!
On the count to 1 0 and I'll let go.
1 , 2... 6, 7...
What?
What about 3 to 5?
8, 9, 1 0!
Stop!
- Get the baby!
- Yes!
Who the hell invented free fall machines?
- Master.
- What a cute baby.
Give me a big smile.
You're my grandson.
- Don't cry, Mummy's here.
- Daddy's here!
- Mummy's here.
- Daddy's here.
- Mummy's here.
- Hold him with your left arm or he'll cry.
Not bad.
I understand why you're giving up your reward.
But I'm keeping this baby.
You should go if you want to stay alive.
Give me a smile.
You're my grandson, understand?
Alright.
As soon as we get the result, the three of us are going to Brazil.
Who are you?
I only want the baby.
Nothing else matters.
- lt's awful to separate him from his mother.
- Awful?
What about my dead son?
Max lost his mother when he was a child.
I promised him his own amusement park.
It's finished now.
I also promised him a race track, but it's only half complete.
And that bitch killed him.
I already lost a son.
I'm not going to lose my grandson.
This child is my only reason for living.
If you feel this way, think about his mother.
She must be feeling the same.
Why must you separate them?
What if he's not your grandson?
What'll happen then?
- The lab report, Master.
- You can go.
What's going on?
What is he doing?
I'm not really sure.
I found the boy.
But he's not your son.
Don't do this, Master.
Prepare the medication.
Mind your health, sir.
Watch him.
Take the kid with you.
- Easy...
- Don't shut the door!
Let him keep you company.
Be careful, Master.
Give him a hand.
Where's the baby?
Give us the baby!
- l want my baby.
- Don't!
Take your money and leave.
I'm turning this place into an ice palace!
A big one.
- A gigantic ice palace.
- Master.
A gigantic ice palace.
What's the matter with you?
- See for yourself.
- You're useless.
That was quick!
Did you see them?
Yes, I saw them both.
Why are you still here?
Throw them out!
Can you do this?
Thank God.
Round and round and round he goes!
Goddamn baldy!
Octopus, the baby hasn't cried for a while.
I'm aware of that!
Baldy!
I hate bald heads.
It's fresh.
Baby!
Octopus!
Baby...
Baby!
Baby...
Baby!
- How is he?
- Take off your jacket.
Baby, hang in there!
You'll be alright.
Baby!
Go!
Put it on!
Baby...
Catch!
Turn it up.
Gorge yourself!
Feed them something extra.
See if you can open the door.
There's no key hole to pick... lt can't be opened from the inside.
- Thongs!
- Octopus?
Are you alright, Thongs?
- Open the door!
- Only the Master knows the combination.
- What?
Only he can open it?
- You saw him.
He has gone mad.
You're on, Landlord.
Do your stuff.
How?
It's a Swiss computerised mechanical lock.
Eight layers with over four million combinations.
Same kind as used by the ClA.
Save your breath, open it while I call the cops.
Run for it...
Stop!
Hey, come back!
Be quiet!
- The machines are too loud.
- Turn off the machines.
- and the refrigerator.
- Unplug the refrigerator.
- And the air conditioning.
- Kill the air conditioning.
- Everybody, hold your breath.
- What?
- Hold your breath!
- Silence!
- Well?
is it open?
- Why doesn't the door pop open?
- Pops open?
- Don't touch it!
Why doesn't it pop open?
Because of this?
It has nothing to do with something so intricate.
Damn... lt's opening!
What took you so long?
Save the baby.
- Save him...
- How is he?
Save the baby.
- You promised me a reduced sentence.
- Alright...
The car!
Don't die on me!
The car...
Hot-wire it!
Don't scare me, Baby...
Come get your milk.
Baby!
Wake up for milk.
Mummy's here, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid...
Baby...
Don't die on me.
Come drink your milk.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up, Baby.
- Pop the hood, use the engine.
- The engine is in the back!
1 , 2, 3!
Wake up!
One more time!
1 , 2, 3!
- Take them away.
- Yes, sir.
Bring your men and block the exits.
- Don't let anyone through.
- Yes, sir!
Baby, Baby!
Come back.
Never mind.
Hurry, please.
Pulse rate 80 BPM.
Max.
This is the police!
Max, come home.
- l want to play with you...
- Just calm down!
Max...
Sorry, Honey!
Take care of yourself.
I thought money was important, but I was wrong.
If there's reincarnation I still want you for my wife.
We'll have 1 0 kids, OK?
I love you.
Darling, while I'm in jail, I miss you every single second.
I now know how awful you must have felt when I was wild and unruly.
I'm really sorry.
If I have the chance to start over, I'll cherish you more.
Dad, all I did was gamble and caused you a lot of trouble.
I've been dealt a lousy hand.
I thought if I had money, I'd earn respect and own the world.
Now I've learnt my lesson, at the expense of my beloved family.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Goodbye.
We'll have lots of kids and play in the garden.
All of us will race each other...
May the Lord forgive your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.
We'll have our own children.
We play in the backyard while you make dinner, and do our laundry.
Fire!
The government policy back then was very strict with the death penalty.
It was only used on convicts who had committed serious crimes.
What you have just witnessed are different forms of the death penalty.
I'm sure you now have a better understanding.
Let's have another round of applause for our inmates who gave us the demonstration.
Well done!
Thank you!
Please help yourselves to the refreshments.
Hi there!
- How are you, Landlady?
- You were great, Thongs.
Where's Dad?
You did a great job, Honey.
I was so scared.
- lt wasn't real, silly.
- What about the "l love you" part?
Of course that was for real.
Honey, I have adopted 1 0 kids!
From South Africa, the Middle East, Germany...
Anyone from Cameroon?
Let me see...
I'm so happy!
Don't over exert yourself, you're pregnant.
Let me carry that...
- Don't frown, it's bad for the baby.
- Speak for yourself.
The doctor said the baby is doing great.
I almost forgot my appointment.
With a man or a woman?
My clients are either men or women.
- l can only meet with women?
- No.
- Space, remember?
- Yes... I have plenty of space here.
Alright...
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for taking care of my Dad.
- How are you getting along?
- There's nothing to it, it's not my first time.
But I promise you it'll be my last.
- Why are you making promises to me?
- l... I promise my Dad.
Thongs.
Inspector.
You have to thank your lucky stars.
The Justice Department may put you on parole.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Look who's here to see you.
- Baby!
- Baby!
Baby!
- Over here...
- Go on.
- Give me a hug.
- Mummy.
It's been a long time.
Sorry we didn't have a chance to apologise.
We're really very sorry.
We know, if it hadn't been for you, our baby could have died.
- l wonder if they'll be interested?
- About what?
- About working for us.
- What?
You'll be in charge of security.
You can be the bodyguard.
You can be the chauffeur.
I'm perfect for the job.
Driving sports cars has to be my pet project.
- Are you interested?
- Absolutely!
We'll wait for your discharge, then.
Our Open Day is over.
Time to return to your cell.
The baby!
Oh, right.
- Mrs. Li, We don't even know his name.
- lt's Matthew.
Ka Sing.
Li Ka Sing?
So long!
Blindfold me, I can't bear to watch.
- How's Jackie?
is he alright?
- Bring me a towel.
That hurts!
- One more time.
- l get to keep this?
Action!
Help him up.
The spine...
You should go for an X-ray.
Bring the car.
Bring the mattresses here.
What are you doing over there?
Come on, over here.
Over here.
Careful!
Careful...
Leave your card with my PA.
She'll save you the best seat.
- When's the press conference?
- l can't hear a word you're saying.
Apply more honey.
More.
Stop, I can't stand this!
- Thongs!
- Steve, I didn't see you.
You say that every time.
You missed the alumni gathering.
- Nobody called me.
- Are you sure?
- Grade school or college?
- lt's supposed to be High School!
Stop fluffing your line!
It was a one-take!
Do you know how scary it was up there?
I now have to do it all over again!
I'll wring your neck for this!
It's Thongs.
To win in treble 4, 8 and 3 for races 3, 4 and 8, $10,000 each bet
Thongs
Who is it?
This is Ivy
Why are you still calling me?
Where are you?
I wish I knew
Don't bother me with secular matters
Go to hell!
Same to you
If that can solve anything, I won't be a monk
You'll burn in hell!
Mind your language, dear
It's an enhanced Siemens 304 refitted with infrared rays
The fuse is on the right, go left
It's me again 4, 8 and 3 for races 3, 4 and 8, $10,000 each to place
I was recently enlightened
Reach for the sky with limited resources
Too many women, too little time
Going after them all is a losing game
Therefore I have decided to focus only on the wealthy ones
The only way to get rich is to find a rich wife
Great!
You think so too?
Move up a bit
More?
More
More...
More...
More...
More...
Don't!
Damn!
I lost by a whisker
You'll gamble your life away
Get lost
It's opened
You should've told me earlier
Not much here
It hurts...
Relax, Mrs. Li
You must spread your legs
Relax, open up!
Open them wide

Alright
Step aside!
Go...
Stop him!
Don't let him get away
McDaddy!
I like talking to you unlike your thugs
All they do is ftght
Know why I like to borrow from you?
You have compassion, sympathy and a conscience
Am I right?
And you are smart, too
I'll repay your $100,000 loan in 100 installments, OK?
It's a deal
I hate smooth talkers
I have a living to make
Don't come over
I was just kidding, McDaddy
You think this is funny?
Don't make mejump
Go ahead
Are you serious?
Jump!
You don't want me dead, do you?
No, but you brought it upon yourself
Get a camera and take a picture
Yes, Boss
If I die, you'll kiss your money goodbye
It won't do us any good
No, I think it's brilliant
I've got so much bad debts lately
This will show the others
Go ahead, jump
No, McDaddy
No?
Let's see...
No?
So you can read my mind?
I'm safe!

Thongs
Inspector Mok
Sorry, I didn't see you
You say that every time
You missed the alumni gathering
Alumni?
Nobody called me No?
No!
Grade school or high school?
Grade school
Here, you know the drill
Is this really necessary?
No need to leap oft a building over a card game
I told you to quit gambling
I hate bailing you out in the middle of the night
You can't count on me much longer
I've decided to retire
Retirement?
You're kidding!
You know my wife is losing her mind and she's getting worse
Last week she grabbed someone's baby and refused to return it
She even bit the mother's hand
She's getting worse, understand?
If I carry on with you two
We'll all end up in jail sooner or later
Who'll take care of her then?
That was 20 years ago
You keep saying that!
I'm still responsible for what happened
What kind of father was I?
My son had high feverfor 2 days
I didn't realise it was meningitis
I'm responsible for his death
We have no children.
There is no hope
What else can I do?
Have another one
I can get Viagra at half price
OK?
Don't provoke him any more
Don't tell me what to do
It's time...
Straighten your shirt
Honey, you're late!
No, I'm not
You were at the top of the stairs yesterday
Now you're only on the third, you don't love me anymore?
I'll hurry tomorrow
I love you very much
Your son
Hey!
Did you pay your rent?
Of course!
Ask him
They did
They're always sneaking around
What's the matter with them?
Don't hang out with them anymore
What?
She knows about us?
We must do something about that
You're more capable than my Dad
I am not even ftt to tie his shoelaces
He's one of the richest men in Asia
If I'm half the man he is it'd be wonderful
Dad will like you very much
I'm sure I'll like him very much too and you, of course
Is my English getting better?
I need to grab a cigarfrom the car
Enjoy your dinner
Yan...
Keep an eye on her
Stop right there!
What the hell?
What's wrong with you?
You can't come here dressed as a chicken!
Think with your head if you want to spy on me
Forget it, I want a divorce
I'm working
I know that.
You'd better not be doing this forfun
I came because Fanny told me she saw you
Who's that inside?
Obviously she's a woman
My clients are either men or women
Can I only have male clients?
Divorce me if you don't trust me
You haven't been home for months, I miss you
Why?
I was stupid enough to marry you at 18
Look at this mess
I can't breathe
Never mind, let's divorce
I'm sorry
Sorry for what?
You have done me no wrong
Just feel sorry for yourself
Go back to school if you have time
If you know any better
You won't be dressed like this
What's the key to a marriage?
Trust
Space
You're suftocating me
I want a divorce
I can't
I'm pregnant
What?
Come again?
I'm pregnant
No way!
When was the last time...
You were drunk that night and forgot to put on...
How could you?
You should have kicked me out of bed
I am ignorant about birth control
Really!
You know how I am with kids
I don't like them.
If we have a child
We'll have no more privacy
Are you sure?
Have you checked?
You can't be more than 3 months pregnant
Don't waste any time
Get an abortion in Shenzhen
You can't afford to wait
I love you!
Hurry!
You can't walk to Shenzhen dressed like that
Take a bus
Go back inside...
Tell me where is Thongs
He's dead
Don't get upset, mind your health
The usual...
Spray paint and take some pictures
Shut the door and windows while you eat, OK?
Don't be mad
Sorry about that
Hey, Thongs Stay away from him
Came to visit yourfather?
Yes
He's a disgrace to the village, ignore him
PAY UP!
Please move along, lady
Easy...
Hurry...
What's going on?
Just leave my family alone
But you were in hiding, pal
How else can we find you?
What are you doing?
Hold on tight!

Help him up
What's the occasion?
Everyone is here
Twins
Look how tall you are, Ting!
Come, I brought presents
These are all for you
Take what you like
This is for you
This is for you
Here's the pillow you wanted and your heater
This is for you, Dad
A massager to ease your back pains
Why did you come back?
I thought you were dead
Stop cursing me like that, Dad
Look at you, a punk!
You were not like this when you were born
I wanted you to be a doctor or lawyer
I sent you to the best schools
But you turned out to be a loser
I may not be a lawyer, but I'm still your son
I wanted to be a professional, too
Even the President, but I'm not cut out for it
Your mother and I saved up every dime to put you through school
I tried, I just can't do it
Don't be so stubborn
Me?
Stubborn?
I'm doing alright.
Look at me
The hell you are
What have you been doing?
Gambling!
I'm a business man
Business?
What business?
Whoring and gambling?
You're a crook
You're nothing but a cheat
All you want is for me to make money
Don't start...
I'm making money now
I bought you everything you wanted
What's wrong with that?
I earned every penny
Money isn't everything
I want you to be an honest man
I did nothing wrong
I don't know... what have I done?
What did I do wrong?
I wonder about these things
How and where you got them from
You probably stole them!
Take them away!
Out!
Dad...
Here, throw this away as well
Get out!
You'd better go You're not my son
I don't have an unworthy son like you
Nobody wants to see you
Take them away!
PAY UP!
Honey!
What is it, Honey?
Is this our bedroom?
Yes, of course.
Are you sure?
Yes, it's our bedroom
We've been robbed!
What?
There's been a burglary!
Goddamn it, who did this?
It's OK, Honey
At least our baby is safe
I'll clean up this mess, OK?
A burglary!
Landlord
What is it, Uncle?
I heard you're retiring.
Made enough already?
I have a big one for you, interested?
I never said I'm retiring.
I'll take any job
Meet for a card game, Thongs 22:00, the usual place
Don't buy a car if you can't afford it
I was just kidding
This is for your troubles You always make me do this
Stop being agitated No
Treat yourself to a massage No!
Come on... take it No!
Be like that, you goddamn midget!
You'll be towing cars for the rest of your life and you'll have a midget son like you!
Did you crack my refrigerator, Octopus?
Is Thongs coming?
What time is it?
There's a big job, I can't decide
I feel we should...
Been painting again?
Must you always wear white?
Did you crack my refrigerator?
Why are you so upset?
The paint is on me!
You should see what I did to those thugs
What were you saying?
We have an assignment
I can't make up my mind
I'll do anything
This is really complicated
Though we'll be paid $77 million...
What?
What?
$7 million?
$7 million?
To do what?
Just hear me out...
Out the crap, let's do it Listen to me...
I'll do anything for $77 million $7 million, you've got to be kidding!
Start the car...
Mind the door!
Watch where you're going
Help me
Landlord...
Give me a hand
You don't have to come with us
I must do this myself
Why is this such a big deal?
Never mind
Just open the door for me, I'll wait down here
Nothing!
I bet they wore the jewellery
Just some foreign currency left
You're kidding...
Where's Landlord?
Probably cracking another safe
What a small world!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Just taking him back to his grandpa
Whose grandpa?
Shut up!
What?
You lied to me too?
What did you feed him?
What is it?
There's a break-in!
Uncle, it's done
Is it Lobster Bay?
Roger that
Do you know what you're doing?
We agreed no raping, looting arson and murder
This is someone else's family feud, stay out
We take the baby to his Grandpa
All it takes is 15 minutes for a blood test
What did you feed him?
Nothing
Just sedative to help him sleep
Are you crazy?
You fed sedative to a baby!
Even burglars have ethics
You taught us that, remember?
Ethics is for reference only
We need to improvise all the time
You should've told us thejob involves a baby
I told you we need to talk but once you heard about the $77 million you pushed me into the car and you even congratulated me
You didn't give me a chance
No way
What are you doing?
Take him back How can you say that?
I dare you to repeat that!
Take him back!
Who supported you all these years?
Who supported you all these years?
Who taught you to pick a lock?
And who taught you to crack a safe?
What will become of you without me?
You're nothing but a loser
And you, a womanizer
I'm sorry... do you know what happened to me?
Do you have any idea?
You know my wife is nuts
And I can barely see these days
I'm going blind.
Do you understand?
Know why I had to do this myself?
Why must I do this?
Use your imagination
Rings any bell?
I've been robbed!
Some bastards cleaned out my $3 million!
I have nothing left...
Who'll support me?
Will you do it?
Can you support me?
Even I get burgled
I'm supposed to be a pro.
Now I have nothing!

There's a break-in at Tycoon Li's Peak mansion
Excuse me, ofticer
I need a favor...
I have a request
Hello?
Turn on the TV, Thongs
Now!
Thanks
According to the latest financial reports...
The Li family's net worth is well over $50 billion
See that?
He's notjust a mongrel
He's a pedigree poodle
It's not regular price anymore
I'll jack it up when I get out
How long will it take?
A week at the most
I'm charged with dangerous driving 2 weeks tops
What?
Who'll look after him?
No one except you, understand?
Wait till I get out
Bye-bye!
A week!
My God...
It's not on!
Quiet...
Again?
What now?
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing?
It stinks!
I don't believe this
He didn't even have much to eat
Don't shove it to me!
There's shit everywhere
Eat this, come on...
Yeah, good boy...
Baby!
Baby!
Don't feed him just anything
How old is he?
How old?
Yes!
How old?
5 to 6 months, I can tell
Who's the father?
He is
I see...
I know your kind
Yes, that's what we are
Don't worry, I have nothing against your kind
But men are so careless
Not this!
This is for 3 year-olds
No, this one doesn't have DHA
This is extra large!
His pee will leak from the side
No!
This is for breast enlargement
I need that, he wants a betterfeel
Don't complicate matters, just hurry!
Life is complicated
You are what you eat
What you feed and teach stay with him for life
You must take this seriously
Let me give you a lesson
I'll show you
Enough!
Just hurry!
Whose napkins are these?
Napkins?
One with wings and one without...
One for day, one for night, which is it?
I want night time with no wings
Day time with wings for me
Just hurry...
Ready?
Yes!
Drink this!
Is it too thick?
This is it
Hurry
Thanks!
We'll each take a class
Alright!
Thanks
Over there, sir!
Help me please!
1... 2... 3
Sit down and relax
I don't get it, can you show me again?
Carry on
Go home and teach your wife
Keep your back straight
Tighten your thighs and buttocks
Straighten the back?
Yes
Is this straight enough?
Look!
It's straight...
Keep it flat and straight
He's so cute!
Yes!
How old is he?
A few months, I think
A few months?
He's big
Where's his mother?
At work
You look after him alone?
That's wonderful!
So cute and loveable
We could have caught a taxi if you'd hurried
Shut up, alright?
What a coincidence!
You just got oft?
No, I work at the hospital
This isjust part time
Chatting her up?
She was our instructor
What a cute baby!
Excuse me!
Where are you?
I'm with your Mom
Really?
Put her on
What?
I can't hear you.
Call me back
Hello?
Hello!
Bitch!
Thank you...
Do stay in touch...
Bye-bye
You're not local?

A student nurse on exchange
Dad had a stroke!

He's in the hospital
Is it serious?
He's out of intensive care
I'll drop by after work
Hurry!
Yes...
Where do you work?
Me?
This is my stop, talk to you later
Let's go!
I'm charged with running a road block, resisting arrest and dangerous driving
They're refusing bail
But the lawyer said I'll be out next week
Next week?
Keep feeding the pedigree poodle
We're supposed to feed him well
And don't hand him over to anyone
Where is the poodle?
Oh my God!
It's the wrong bus!
Sorry...
Picture perfect!
Give me a kiss!
It's yourfault!
Are you alright?
Thanks
Don't hold him like that
Careful with his arm!
You'rejust plain negligent!
Leaving him behind on the bus
Can you help me?
Octopus!
I don't believe this!
How can he miss out by a whisker?
I should have known better
I lose money on him every time
I do the dishes, you take a bath
Let's take a bath together, OK?
I'm rich!
I've won, at last
Isn't it fun?
Hey!
Can you believe this?
Thanks so much, Melody
If not for you
We wouldn't know what to do with him
Octopus and I are grateful
Actually, I'm very grateful...
So that's how he was revived
Yan...
Did you do what I told you to do?
You don't have to go if you're busy
Should I call her?
Was I too harsh?
This is Yan, I can't come to the phone right now
Leave a message at the beep
Alan!
Long time no see, Thongs
Your baby?
Hey, stop it!
Carry on...
Come...
Be a good boy!
Don't do that!
Thongs, what's your game?
Get out if you're not playing!
Don't bring a kid in here!
Get lost!
Life is complicated, you are what you eat
What you feed and teach stay with him for life
You must take this seriously
Thongs, are you in or not?
Go home and babysit!
Get lost!
I'm not playing
Loser!
Cleaned out already?
No, he was crying too much
Yes, that's a good boy
How aboutjust one bet?
Just one?
No more gambling
I quit...
You're worse than my Dad!
I really don't know
I've been calling Landlord all night
I'm a man of my word
I'll fix it for you
I just want the boy!
Let me out...
Is this a joke?
Landlord has 2 partners in crime
Thongs and Octopus
Let me out!
Thongs and Octopus
I don't care what you do, ftnd them
I found them, Boss.
They're inside Very good!
Now we change the diaper
Are you Thongs?
Give me the baby
What baby?
Don't play dumb
I don't know any Uncles
Don't play dumb with me
What is it?
They're looking for Baby
My name is Baby, looking for me?
Damn!
You're asking for it!
Go!
What's the matter with you?
Nothing, I just overjumped
What did they say?
Who cares?
Let's go
Remember?
Yes
Ring the bell, when he opens the door...
I'll splash the paint on your cue
Let him have it!
Yes
Wait!
Thongs, don't hide behind women and babies
I won't spare you!
I don't understand a word you're saying
Thongs is my buddy
He's not here right now, come back later
No problem, we'll wait for him inside
He's my kid brother
Nice to meet you
There's no one here
Fanny, I'm scared
Is it worse than abortion?
Ask him about the future?
Confront him with the ultrasound
Be good
Who are you looking for?
Octopus
He is not here, come back later
You'd better come in ftrst
Thongs
Make sure the baby is home
What's that look on your face?
Toothache
Why is Octopus oft in such a hurry?
He needs to use the toilet
You live here?
Yes
I love to come up for a chat
Steve!
Octopus!
Thongs...
You've ftnally shown up!
I'm tired of leaving messages on you voicemail
Leave!
I'll tend to you later
Come here...
Where's the baby?
In your room.
Who are they?
Decorators
My ftat is a mess
What's with the paint?
We're renovating, just trying out the colors
What is it, Yan?
Oh, no!
Talk to the ofticer
What is it, Miss?
Thongs...
The police can help you with any problem
There's a cop in there!
Go to the roof
Sit down and tell me your problem
Meet my good friend
Inspector Steve Mok
He's my... cousin
He's my... other cousin
We came to show him... the color sample
Yourface...
I'm into body art
What's with all the baby stuff?
You know my pal Octopus...
He's a born womanizer
He got someone pregnant
Can't do much about that
Where is he now?
In the toilet
I need to go too
You do?
I'm investigating a break-in
Know anything about it?
I've quit long time ago
Octopus, Inspector wants to have a word
Hurry up
Octopus...
What took you so long?
You're here?
Your turn
Not after him, it stinks in there
You have a friend in there
Friend?
He's my cousin too
I'm the eldest
Then let's reminisce
Never met each other?
Of course they have
Take care of this, Octopus
Why are you still here?
I want a divorce!
What the hell is this?
Never mind, I want a divorce
You...
And you...
It sounds complicated
Yes, very complicated
Thongs, we've been friends for so long
I didn't know you have cousins of difterent races
My Dad was a sailor...
He must have stopped in India
That'll make him your brother
That's not right
Maybe the sailor was his Grandpa
Or his mother's father
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
I have occasional muscle spasms
Muscle spasms?
Well?
Cramps...
You're probably possessed!
Give me a hand
Baby...
Hold on...
Help me, Thongs!
Give us a hand!
I'd like to...
I can use my mouth
Catch!
Beat it!
You won't get away with this!
You have a lot of nerve, Thongs
Hurry up!
Oh no!
They're inside, go get them!
Mind your head!
You're so greedy
Listen to me, Steve
You can confess at the station
I'll turn myself in afterwards
Who'd believe you?
Are you alright?
Just worry about yourself!
Don't hit my head
Thongs!
Stay back!
Should have listened to me
I'll get you, Thongs!
Octopus!
Run!
Come back!
Alright...
Get up!
After the truck!
Stop!
Stop!
Police!
I need to use your bike!
Go...
What?
It's not mine
I'm on learner's permit
I'll ask the Commissioner to grant you a proper license!
Go!
Really?
Yes!
Mind if I ask...
What did you use to drive?
I'm just a video gamer!
Shit!
Someone is tailing us
Looks like a robber to me
In broad daylight?
Now what?
Don't worry, call Headquarters
Ask for back up

You're too busy to care
I'm sorry, Dad
Take good care of Dad

The doctor said he'll be fine
Thanks
You don't have to worry

You don't have to explain
No matter what

There you are, Thongs
Don't do anything stupid
There's a baby...
Watch the baby!

Let go
You let go
Together on a count to three 1 * 2 * 3
Don't cry
About the loan...
I'm not in the mood for that
But you grabbed me...
Just occupational reflex
What's wrong with your baby?
Measles.
He won't drink his milk
Boil some carrots water chestnuts and barley
Give him the juice
What?
Just tell his mother to make it
His mother?
She ran oft
What about his mother...
His mother?
Gone as well
Where did you get his clothes?
Anywhere
$80 at the convenient store, 10% oft
$72?
A further 10% oft with a discount card
That's $64.80
Do you have a discount card?
Here, take mine
I'll forfeit today's interest

You think she'll recognize him?
You're worried she'll recognize the baby?

Don't be silly
You made me very happy
You're my most precious darling
Not so loud, you're waking him
Good baby
I'm returning him tomorrow
I have sorted out the baby formula
So nice to be a baby
Eat, sleep, drink and shit
So happy and without a care in the world
Right?
Right!
Why do you trust me?
You know I'm a burglar still you made friends with me
Actually...
The ftrst time I saw you
I knew you have a conscience
If you have a chance to start over
Will you still be a burglar?
It's too late for that now

It's never too late
Look at me
Look me in the eye
I've faith in you
It's Mommie

I got the money
Bring the kid
Someone will fetch you in 5 minutes
Wait here!
Open the gate!
Where is he?
Give me the baby!
Thirty...
Million...
Give me the baby
Listen...
Feed him milk every 4 hours
Check the temperature with the back of your hand or you'll scald him, understand?
Also, everyday at noon...
He needs his orange juice, get it?
He chokes easily since he has no teeth even crushed fruits will choke him
If you feed him solid food, you must chew...
Don't be such a nag
Also
Hold him with your left arm or he'll cry
Give him congee in the afternoon
Chop up some lean pork, ftnely diced
Not too cold, not too hot
Serve in two separate bowls
Okay, okay.
Just hand him over
Alright
Be careful I will
Here, take this bottle too
The temperature is right I got it...
Don't rock him too hard
It's time to feed him Enough
I wonder if he'll survive the night
What are you staring at?
Get lost
Come on, let's go
What are you doing?
Don't worry
They have doctors and nurses, he'll be fine
It's just family squabbles
They're taking take him to his Grandpa
Think about your Ferrari and your casino
Come on!
Come on!
Get the car ready Yes!
Finished?
Let's go
Take him upstairs
Daddy
Mommie
Daddy's coming!

Good boy
Landlord!

Give me the baby!
Turn on the machine
Hurry!
Send someone to the ferris wheel
Yes, sir!
Oh my God!
Baby!

Where are you, Baby?
Mommie
Don't move, I'm coming up!
Mommie
Stay right there...
I'm here
Baby!
Baby!
Daddy
It's not funny!
Great job, Thongs!
You deserve a kiss!
Don't hurt the baby, morons!
Daddy!
Run, Daddy!
Hurry up and get in!
Isn't it fun?
Then let's continue
Get the kid!
Send the other train!
Don't worry
I'll get it back for you
Thongs!
I only want the boy!
Come out... or I'll drop him!
We all die sooner or later
It's a matter of going in style
Take the baby and go.
Don't mind me!
I doubt if he'll drop me
Thongs!
On the count to 10... and I'll let go
1 * 2... 6 * 7...
What?
What about 3 to 5?
8 * 9 * 10!
Stop!
Stop!
Get the baby!
Yes!
Who the hell invented free fall machines?
Master
What a cute baby
Give me a big smile...
You're my grandson
Don't cry, Mommie's here
Daddy's here...
Mommie's here
Daddy's here...
Mommie's here
Hold him with your left arm or he'll cry
Not bad
I understand why you're giving up your reward
But I'm keeping this baby
You should go if you want to stay alive
Give me a smile
You're my grandson, understand?
Alright...
As soon as we get the result
The 3 of us are going to Brazil
Who are you?
I only want the baby
Nothing else matters
It's awful to separate him from his mom
Awful?
What about my dead son?
Max lost his mother when he was a child
I promised him his own amusement park
It's ftnished now
I also promised him a race track
But it's only half complete and that bitch killed him
I already lost a son
I'm not going to lose my grandson
This child... is my only hope for living
If you feel this way, think about his mother
She must be feeling the same
Why must you separate them?
What if he's not your grandson?
What'll happen then?
The lab report, Master
You can go
What's going on?
What is he doing?
I'm not really sure
I found the boy
But he's not your son
Don't do this, Master
Prepare the medication
Mind your health, sir
Watch him
Take the kid with you
Easy...
Don't shut the door!
Let him keep you company
Be careful, Master
Give him a hand
Where's the baby?
Give us the baby!
I want my baby
Don't!
Take your money and leave
I'm turning this place into an ice palace!
A big one
A gigantic ice palace Master
Gigantic ice palace
A gigantic ice palace
What's the matter with you?
See for yourself
You're useless
That was quick!
You saw them?
Yes, I saw them both...
Why are you still here?
Throw them out!

Why doesn't the door pop open?
Pops open?

Sorry, Honey!
Take care of yourself
I thought money was important, but I was wrong
If there's reincarnation...
I still want you for my wife
We'll have 10 kids, OK?
I love you
While I'm in jail
I missed you every single second
I now know how awful you must have felt when I was wild and unruly
I'm really sorry
If I have the chance to start over...
I'll cherish you more
All I did was gamble and caused you a lot of trouble
I've been dealt a lousy hand
I thought if I had money
I'll earn respect and own the world
Now I've learnt my lesson at the expense of my beloved family
I'm sorry, Dad
Goodbye
We'll have lots of kids and play in the garden
All of us will race each other
May the Lord forgive your sins
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen
We'll have our own children
We play in the backyard while you make dinner...
And do our laundry
Fire!
The government policy back then was very strict with the death penalty
It was only used on convicts who have committed serious crimes
What you have just witnessed are different forms of the death penalty
I'm sure you now have a better understanding

Well done!
Thank you!
Please help yourselves to the refreshments

Don't frown, it's bad for the baby
Speak for yourself
The doctor said the baby is doing great

My clients are either men or women
I can only meet with women?
No
Space, remember?

There's one best way to be a millionaire marry a millionaire thats a girl!

I'm too nervous
Check it for me, Hairy
Alright
Step aside!
Go...
Stop him!
Don't let him get away
McDaddy!
I like talking to you unlike your thugs
All they do is fight
K. Now why I like to borrow from you?
You have compassion.
Sympathy and a conscience
Am I right?
And you are smart.
Too
I'II repay your $100,000 loan in 100 installments.
OK?
It's a deal
I hate smooth talkers
I have a living to make
Don't come over
I was just kidding, McDaddy
You think this is funny?
Don't make me jump
Go ahead
Are you serious?
Jump!
You don't want me dead.
Do you?
No.
But you brought it upon yourself
Get a camera and take a picture
Yes.
Boss
If I die.
You'II kiss your money goodbye
It won't do us any good
No.
I think it's brilliant
I've got so much bad debts lately
This will show the others
Go ahead, jump
No.
McDaddy

Let's see...
No?
So you can read my mind?
I'm safe!

Thongs
Inspector Mok
Sorry.
I didn't see you
You say that every time
You missed the alumni gathering
Alumni?
Nobody called me No?
No!
Grade school or high school?
Grade school
Here, you know the drill
Is this really necessary?
No need to leap off a building over a card game
I told you to quit gambling
I hate bailing you out in the middle of the night
You can't count on me much longer
I've decided to retire
Retirement?
You're kidding!
You know my wife is losing her mind and she's getting worse
Last week she grabbed someone's baby and refused to return it
She even bit the mother's hand
She's getting worse.
Understand?
If I carry on with you two
We'II all end up in jail sooner or later
Who'll take care of her then?
That was 20 years ago
You keep saying that!
I'm still responsible for what happened
What kind of father was I?
My son had high fever for 2 days
I didn't realise it was meningitis
I'm responsible for his death
We have no children.
There is no hope
What else can I do?
Have another one
I can get Viagra at half price
OK?
Don't provoke him any more
Don't tell me what to do
It's time...
Straighten your shirt
Honey, you're late!
No.
I'm not
You were at the top of the stairs yesterday
Now you're only on the third.
You don't love me anymore?
I'II hurry tomorrow
I love you very much
Your son
Hey!
Did you pay your rent?
Of course!
Ask him
They did
They're always sneaking around
What's the matter with them?
Don't hang out with them anymore
What?
She knows about us?
We must do something about that
You're more capable than my Dad
I am not even fit to tie his shoelaces
He's one of the richest men in Asia
If I'm half the man he is it'd be wonderful
Dad will like you very much
I'm sure I'll like him very much too and you, of course
Is my English getting better?
I need to grab a cigar from the car
Enjoy your dinner
Yan., .
Keep an eye on her
Stop right there!
What the hell?
What's wrong with you?
You can't come here dressed as a chicken!
Think with your head if you want to spy on me
Forget it, I want a divorce
I'm working
I know that.
You'd better not be doing this for fun
I came because Fanny told me she saw you
Who's that inside?
Obviously she's a woman
My clients are either men or women
Can I only have male clients?
Divorce me if you don't trust me
You haven't been home for months.
I miss you
Why?
I was stupid enough to marry you at 18
Look at this mess
I can't breathe
Never mind.
Let's divorce
I'm sorry
Sorry for what?
You have done me no wrong
Just feel sorry for yourself
Go back to school if you have time
If you know any better
You won't be dressed like this
What's the key to a marriage?
Trust
Space
You're suffocating me
I want a divorce
I can't
I'm pregnant
What?
Come again?
I'm pregnant
No way!
When was the last time...
You were drunk that night and forgot to put on,
How could you?
You should have kicked me out of bed
I am ignorant about birth control
Really!
You know how I am with kids
I don't like them.
If we have a child
We'II have no more privacy
Are you sure?
Have you checked?
You can't be more than 3 months pregnant
Don't waste any time
Get an abortion in Shenzhen
You can't afford to wait
I love you!
Hurry!
You can't walk to Shenzhen dressed like that
Take a bus
Go back inside...
Tell me where is Thongs
He's dead
Don't get upset.
Mind your health
The usual...
Spray paint and take some pictures
Shut the door and windows while you eat.
OK?
Don't be mad
Sorry about that
Hey, Thongs Stay away from him
Came to visit your father?
Y es
He's a disgrace to the village.

Dad
A massager to ease your back pains
Why did you come back?
I thought you were dead
Stop cursing me like that.
Dad
Look at you, a punk!
You were not like this when you were born
I wanted you to be a doctor or lawyer
I sent you to the best schools
But you turned out to be a loser
I may not be a lawyer, but I'm still your son
I wanted to be a professional, too
Even the President.
But I'm not cut out for it
Your mother and I saved up every dime to put you through school
I tried.
I just can't do it
Don't be so stubborn
Me?
Stubborn?
I'm doing alright, Look at me
The hell you are
What have you been doing?
Gambling!
I'm a business man
Business?
What business?
Whoring and gambling?
You're a crook
You're nothing but a cheat
All you want is for me to make money
Don't start...
I'm making money now
I bought you everything you wanted
What's wrong with that?
I earned every penny
Money isn't everything
I want you to be an honest man
I did nothing wrong
I don't know... what have I done?
What did I do wrong?
I wonder about these things
How and where you got them from
You probably stole them!
Take them away!
Out!
Dad,
Here, throw this away as well
Get out!
You'd better go You're not my son
I don't have an unworthy son like you
Nobody wants to see you
Take them away!
PAY UP!
Honey!
What is it, Honey?
Is this our bedroom?
Yes.
Of course.
Are you sure?
Yes.
It's our bedroom
We've been robbed!
What?
There's been a burglary!
Goddamn it.
Who did this?
It's OK...
Honey
At least our baby is safe
I'II clean up this mess.
OK?
A burglary!
Landlord
What is it, Uncle?
I heard you're retiring, Made enough already?
I have a big one for you.
Interested?
I never said I'm retiring.
I'll take any job
Meet for a card game, Thongs 22:00, the usual place
Don't buy a car if you can't afford it
I was just kidding
This is for your troubles You always make me do this
Stop being agitated No
Treat yourself to a massage No!
Come on... take it No!
Be like that, you goddamn midget!
You'll be towing cars for the rest of your life and you'II have a midget son like you!
Did you crack my refrigerator.
Octopus?
Is Thongs coming?
What time is it?
There's a big job, I can't decide
I feel we should,
Been painting again?
Must you always wear white?
Did you crack my refrigerator?
Why are you so upset?
The paint is on me!
You should see what I did to those thugs
What were you saying?
We have an assignment
I can't make up my mind
I'II do anything
This is really complicated
Though we'II be paid $7 million,
What?
What?
$7 million?
$7 million?
To do what?
Just hear me out,
Cut the crap, let's do it Listen to me,
I'II do anything for $7 million $7 million.
You've got to be kidding!
Start the car, Mind the door!
Watch where you're going
Help me
Landlord...
Give me a hand
You don't have to come with us
I must do this myself
Why is this such a big deal?
Never mind
Just open the door for me.
I'll wait down here
Nothing!
I bet they wore the jewellery
Just some foreign currency left
You're kidding,
Where's Landlord?
Probably cracking another safe
What a small world!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Just taking him back to his grandpa
Whose grandpa?
Shut up!
What?
You lied to me too?
What did you feed him?
What is it?
There's a break-in!
Uncle, it's done
Is it Lobster Bay?
Roger that
Do you know what you're doing?
We agreed no raping, looting arson and murder
This is someone else's family feud, stay out
We take the baby to his Grandpa
All it takes is 15 minutes for a blood test
What did you feed him?
Nothing
Just sedative to help him sleep
Are you crazy?
You fed sedative to a baby!
Even burglars have ethics
You taught us that.
Remember?
Ethics is for reference only
We need to improvise all the time
You should've told us the job involves a baby
I told you we need to talk but once you heard about the $7 million you pushed me into the car and you even congratulated me
You didn't give me a chance
No way
What are you doing?
Take him back How can you say that?
I dare you to repeat that!
Take him back!
Who supported you all these years?
Who supported you all these years?
Who taught you to pick a lock?
And who taught you to crack a safe?
What will become of you without me?
You're nothing but a loser
And you, a womanizer
I'm sorry... do you know what happened to me?
Do you have any idea?
You know my wife is nuts
And I can barely see these days
I'm going blind, Do you understand?
K. Now why I had to do this myself?
Why must I do this?
Use your imagination
Rings any bell?
I've been robbed!
Some bastards cleaned out my $3 million!
I have nothing left,
Who'll support me?
Will you do it?
Can you support me?
Even I get burgled
I'm supposed to be a pro, Now I have nothing!
I can manage on my own
I know I can!
I don't need your help
Landlord
Get in
Let's go home and get some sleep
If I wasn't driving this piece of shit
You'll be eating my dust
Get out of the way, asshole!
If I let you overtake me in that car
I'm a real son of a bitch
Stop this nonsense!
Careful with the kid
Are you crazy?
Let him pass
Hello?
Uncle?
Are you there yet?
Almost.
And you?
5 more minutes
Some asshole is blocking the road
We're dueling with an asshole too
Don't be late, the buyer is punctual
No problem
Be careful and lose that asshole quick

I should have known better
I lose money on him every time

I've won.
At last
Isn't it fun?
Hey!
Can you believe this?
Thanks so much.
Melody
If not for you
We wouldn't know what to do with him
Octopus and I are grateful
Actually.
I'm very grateful...
So that's how he was revived
Yan...
Did you do what I told you to do?
You don't have to go if you're busy
Should I call her?
Was I too harsh?
This is Yan, I can't come to the phone right now
Leave a message at the beep
Alan!
Long time no see, Thongs
Your baby?

You're worse than my Dad!
I really don't know
I've been calling Landlord all night

You're asking for it!
Go!
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

He's not here right now.
Come back later
No problem.
We'II wait for him inside
He's my kid brother
Nice to meet you
There's no one here
Fanny, I'm scared
Is it worse than abortion?
Ask him about the future?
Confront him with the ultrasound
Be good
Who are you looking for?
Octopus
He is not here, come back later
You'd better come in first
Thongs
Make sure the baby is home
What's that look on your face?
Toothache
Why is Octopus off in such a hurry?
He needs to use the toilet
You live here?
Y es
I love to come up for a chat
Steve!
Octopus!
Thongs,
You've finally shown up!
I'm tired of leaving messages on you voicemail
Leave!
I'll tend to you later
Come here,

Can't do much about that
Where is he now?
In the toilet
I need to go too
You do?
I'm investigating a break-in

I've quit long time ago
Octopus.
Inspector wants to have a word
Hurry up
Octopus...
What took you so long?
You're here?
Your turn
Not after him, it stinks in there
You have a friend in there
Friend?
He's my cousin too
I'm the eldest
Then let's reminisce
Never met each other?
Of course they have
Take care of this, Octopus
Why are you still here?
I want a divorce!
What the hell is this?
Never mind.
I want a divorce
You...
And you,
It sounds complicated
Yes.
Very complicated
Thongs.
We've been friends for so long
I didn't know you have cousins of different races
My Dad was a sailor,
He must have stopped in India
That'II make him your brother
That's not right
Maybe the sailor was his Grandpa
Or his mother's father
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
I have occasional muscle spasms
Muscle spasms?
Well?
Cramps,
You're probably possessed!
Give me a hand
Baby,
Hold on...
Help me.
Thongs!
Give us a hand!
I'd like to...
I can use my mouth
Catch!
Beat it!
You won't get away with this!
You have a lot of nerve.
Thongs
Hurry up!
Oh no!
They're inside.
Go get them!
Mind your head!
You're so greedy
Listen to me, Steve
You can confess at the station
I'II turn myself in afterwards
Who'd believe you?
Are you alright?
Just worry about yourself!
Don't hit my head
Thongs!
Stay back!
Should have listened to me
I'II get you, Thongs!
Octopus!
Run!
Come back!
Alright...
Get up!
After the truck!
Stop!
Stop!
Police!
I need to use your bike!
Go...
What?
It's not mine
I'm on learner's permit
I'II ask the Commissioner to grant you a proper license!
Go!
Really?
Yes!
Mind if I ask,
What did you use to drive?
I'm just a video gamer!
Shit!
Someone is tailing us
Looks like a robber to me
In broad daylight?
Now what?
Don't worry.
Call Headquarters
Ask for back up
Come in.
Headquarters...
This is 3321.
Daniel calling
Suspected robbery in progress!
Stop the car.
Kid!
Who are you calling a kid?
I can tell that you're a thief!
Having serious fun?
I'II...
Ram your butt!
Move closer...
Easy.
Slow down a bit,
What?
Another one?
On a motorbike?
Stop the car!
Stop
He's cute!
Hop over!
The Commissioner will be in touch
Bye!
That way!
After him!
Free the pushchair!
Do you think I'm sunbathing?
Almost there!
Move closer...
Stop!
Turn...
Turn, ram him!
Thank God!
Watch out!
You call yourself a driver?
Thank God!
That was close
Everything's fine
Back up was quick!
Thanks to you
Where are you from?
I'm from Broke Broke Mountain!
I'm a cop, kid
I need to use your bike
You're nuts
I dare you to say that again
Everything is taken care of, keep in touch
Thanks
This is Octopus, if you need me,
Leave a message after the tone
IOU
Let's pay off Thongs' debts
Don't worry.
Dad.
Here's my contribution
What happened to you?
Uncle,
You've turned into an ice-lolly
Boss, I can explain,
We're men of honour...
We never renege
We always keep our word
Never break a promise
One for all, and...
All for you!
$30 millions
Thirty...
Million,
That's my offer, take it or leave it
Money is nothing between you and me
Whatever you say
Who is it?
It's me
You're home!
Who's the kid?
He's crying like crazy
Check him out for me
Well?
You need to change him and he's running a fever
Fever?
Yes!
What shall I do?
Take him to a doctor
Take him to a doctor?
Hurry!
Landlord?
I'm free
Thank God for that
Where are you now?
On my way to the hospital
Hospital?
What happened?
The baby is sick
Tell Octopus to meet us there
Thongs?
Be careful.
Dad
What happened?
I called you about Dad's stroke
You're too busy to care
I'm sorry.
Dad
Take good care of Dad
Are you alright?
The fever broke
The doctor said he'II be fine
Thanks
You don't have to worry
I...
You don't have to explain
No matter what
You saved his life
Wait here, I'II get his prescription
Thanks
It's OK.
There you are, Thongs
Don't do anything stupid
There's a baby,
Watch the baby!
I have a baby too
Let go
You let go
Together on a count to three 1, 2.3
Don't cry
About the loan,
I'm not in the mood for that
But you grabbed me...
Just occupational reflex
What's wrong with your baby?
Measles.
He won't drink his milk
Boil some carrots water chestnuts and barley
Give him the juice
What?
Just tell his mother to make it
His mother?
She ran off
What about his mother,
His mother?
Gone as well
Where did you get his clothes?
Anywhere
$80 at the convenient store, 10% off
$72?
A further 10% off with a discount card
That's $64. 80
Do you have a discount card?
Here, take mine
I'II forfeit today's interest
But I'II start chasing tomorrow
Come on!
Just doing my job
Thongs
Landlord
Here's my million dollar poodle

Do you know how much more
I have bargained for you for this poodle?
I give you 3 guesses
$30 millions
This $5 millions is just the deposit
We deliver in 3 hours and we get $25 millions more!
It's too good to be true
Give him this glucose later
It's not necessary, now that his fever broke
What?
You two have become nannies now?
It can't be
What is this?
3 Ferraris
What are you thinking?
Your own casino.
Bigger than Monte Carlo
Come on!
Give us a chance
No matter what you want
We'II do it
Just don't hurt our baby
There's nothing to watch on TV
You think she'II recognize him?
You're worried she'II recognize the baby?
This baby is barely,
I need some fresh air
One of 100 a day
They all look the same
Everyone says he takes after his father.
I disagree
She won't be able to tell, understand?

Why do you trust me?
You know I'm a burglar still you made friends with me

The first time I saw you

Look at me
Look me in the eye
I've faith in you
It's Mommie

Someone will fetch you in 5 minutes
Wait here!
Open the gate!
Where is he?
Give me the baby!
Thirty...
Million,
Give me the baby
Listen...
Feed him milk every 4 hours
Check the temperature with the back of your hand or you'II scald him.
Understand?
Also, everyday at noon,
He needs his orange juice.
Get it?
He chokes easily since he has no teeth even crushed fruits will choke him
If you feed him solid food.
You must chew,
Don't be such a nag
Also
Hold him with your left arm or he'II cry
Give him congee in the afternoon
Chop up some lean pork, finely diced
Not too cold.
Not too hot
Serve in two separate bowls
Okay.
Okay.
Just hand him over
Alright
Be careful I will
Here, take this bottle too
The temperature is right I got it...
Don't rock him too hard
It's time to feed him Enough
I wonder if he'll survive the night
What are you staring at?
Get lost
Come on.
Let's go
What are you doing?
Don't worry

Then let's continue

I doubt if he'll drop me
Thongs!

You're my grandson
Don't cry.
Mommie's here
Daddy's here...
Mommie's here
Daddy's here...
Mommie's here
Hold him with your left arm or he'II cry
Not bad
I understand why you're giving up your reward
But I'm keeping this baby
You should go if you want to stay alive
Give me a smile
You're my grandson, understand?
Alright...
As soon as we get the result
The 3 of us are going to Brazil
Who are you?
I only want the baby
Nothing else matters
It's awful to separate him from his mom
Awful?
What about my dead son?
Max lost his mother when he was a child
I promised him his own amusement park
It's finished now
I also promised him a race track
But it's only half complete and that bitch killed him
I already lost a son
I'm not going to lose my grandson
This child, is my only hope for living
If you feel this way.
Think about his mother
She must be feeling the same
Why must you separate them?
What if he's not your grandson?
What'll happen then?
The lab report, Master
You can go
What's going on?
What is he doing?
I'm not really sure
I found the boy
But he's not your son
Don't do this, Master
Prepare the medication
Mind your health, sir
Watch him
Take the kid with you
Easy, Don't shut the door!
Let him keep you company
Be careful.
Master
Give him a hand
Where's the baby?
Give us the baby!
I want my baby
Don't!
Take your money and leave
I'm turning this place into an ice palace!
A big one
A gigantic ice palace Master
Gigantic ice palace
A gigantic ice palace
What's the matter with you?
See for yourself
You're useless
That was quick!
You saw them?
Yes.
I saw them both...
Why are you still here?
Throw them out!
Can you do this?
Thank God
Round and round and round he goes!
Goddamn baldie!
Octopus.
The baby hasn't cried for a while
I'm aware of it!
Baldie,
I hate bald heads
It's fresh
Baby!
Octopus!
Baby,
Baby!
Baby,
How is he?
Take off your jacket
Baby, hang in there!
You'll be alright
Baby,
Go!
Put it on!
Baby,
Catch!
Turn it up
Gorge yourself!
Feed them something extra
See if you can open the door
There's no key hole to pick...
It can't be opened from inside
Thongs!
Octopus?
Are you alright, Thongs?
Open the door!
Only the Master knows the combination
What?
Only he can open it?
You saw him, He has gone mad
You're on.
Landlord, Do your stuff
How?
It's a Swiss computerized mechanical lock 8 layers with over 4 million combinations
Same kind used by the C IA
Save your breath.
Open it while I call the cops
Run for it,
Stop!
Hey, come back!
Be quiet!
Freeze!
The machines are too loud
Turn off the machines and the refrigerator
Unplug the refrigerator and the air conditioning
K. Ill the air conditioning
Everybody, hold your breath
What?
Hold your breath!
Silence!
Well?
Is it open?
Why doesn't the door pop open?
Pops open?
Don't touch it!
Why doesn't it pop open?
Because of this?
It has nothing to do with something so intricate
Damn...
It's opened!
What took you so long?
Save the baby
Save him...
How is he?
Save the baby
You promised me reduced sentence
Alright...
The car!
Don't die on me!
The car,
Hot-wired it!
Don't scare me.
Baby...
Come get your milk
Baby!
Wake up for milk
Mommie's here.
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid...
Baby,
Don't die on me
Come drink your milk, Wake up!

Never mind
Hurry, please,
Pulse rate 80 BPM
Max
This is the police!
Max.
Come home
I want to play with you,
Just calm down!
Max...
Sorry.
Honey!
Take care of yourself
I thought money was important, but I was wrong
If there's reincarnation...
I still want you for my wife
We'II have 10 kids.
OK?
I love you
While I'm in jail
I missed you every single second
I now know how awful you must have felt when I was wild and unruly
I'm really sorry
If I have the chance to start over,
I'II cherish you more
All I did was gamble and caused you a lot of trouble
I've been dealt a lousy hand
I thought if I had money
I'II earn respect and own the world
Now I've learnt my lesson at the expense of my beloved family
I'm sorry.
Dad
Goodbye
We'II have lots of kids and play in the garden
All of us will race each other
May the Lord forgive your sins
In the name of the Father.
The Son and the Holy Ghost.
Amen
We'II have our own children
We play in the backyard while you make dinner,
And do our laundry
Fire!
The government policy back then was very strict with the death penalty
It was only used on convicts who have committed serious crimes
What you have just witnessed are different forms of the death penalty
I'm sure you now have a better understanding
Let's have another round of applause for our inmates who gave us the demonstration
Well done!
Thank you!
Please help yourselves to the refreshments
Hi there!
How are you, Landlady?
You were great, Thongs
Where's Dad?
You did a great job.
Honey
I was so scared
It wasn't real.
Silly
What about the I love you part?
Of course that's for real
Honey, I have adopted 10 kids
From South Africa, the Middle East.
Germany,
Anyone from Cameroon?
Let me see...
I'm so happy
Don't over exert yourself.
You're pregnant
Let me carry that...
Don't frown.
It's bad for the baby
Speak for yourself
The doctor said the baby is doing great
I almost forgot my appointment
With a man or a woman?
My clients are either men or women
I can only meet with women?
No
Space.
Remember?
Yes...
I have plenty of space here
Alright...
Thanks for coming
Thanks for taking care of my Dad
How are you getting along?
There's nothing to it.
It's not my first time
But I promise you it'II be my last
Why are you making promises to me?
I...
I promise my Dad
Thongs
Inspector
You have to thank your lucky stars
The Justice Department may put you on parole
Thanks Thanks
Look who's here to see you
Baby
Baby,
Over here...
Go on
Give me a hug
Mommie
It's been a long time
Sorry we didn't have a chance to apologize
We're really very sorry
We know.
If it hadn't been for you
Our baby could have died
I wonder if they'II be interested
About what?
About working for us
What?
You'll be in charge of security
You can be the bodyguard
You can the chauffeur
I'm perfect for the job
Driving sports cars has to be my pet project
Are you interested?
Absolutely...
We'II wait for your discharge.
Then
Our Open Day is over
Time to return to your cell
Baby,

What are you doing over there?
Come on... over here

She'll save you the best seat
When's the press conference?
I can't hear a word you're saying
Apply more honey
More
Stop.
I can't stand this!
Thongs!
Steve, I didn't see you
You say that every time
You missed the alumni gathering
Nobody called me
Are you sure?
Grade school or college?
It's supposed to be High School!
Stop fluffing your line!
It was a one-take!
Do you know how scary it was up there?
I now have to do it all over again!
I'II wring your neck for this!
It's Thongs.
To win in treble 4, 8 and 3 for races 3, 4 and 8. $10,000 each bet
Thongs
Who is it?
This is Ivy
Why are you still calling me?
Where are you?
I wish I knew
Don't bother me with secular matters
Go to hell!
Same to you
If that can solve anything.
I won't be a monk
You'll burn in hell!
Mind your language.

The fuse is on the right, go left
It's me again 4. 8 and 3 for races 3, 4 and 8.

Reach for the sky with limited resources
Too many women, too little time
Going after them all is a losing game
Therefore I have decided to focus only on the wealthy ones
The only way to get rich is to find a rich wife
Great!
You think so too?
Move up a bit
More?
More
More...
More...
More...
More...
Don't!
Damn!
I lost by a whisker
You'll gamble your life away
Get lost

Are you serious?
Jump!
You don't want me dead.
Do you?
No.
But you brought it upon yourself
Get a camera and take a picture
Yes.
Boss
If I die.
You'II kiss your money goodbye
It won't do us any good
No.
I think it's brilliant
I've got so much bad debts lately
This will show the others
Go ahead, jump
No.
McDaddy
No?
Let's see...
No?
So you can read my mind?
I'm safe!
Come on!
Come after me!
You!
Take this!
I'II get you, Thongs
What are you doing.
Pal?
Fixing the air-conditioning It's OK... go back in
Look, Boss!
Cops!
Here they come
Go!
Thongs
Inspector Mok
Sorry.
I didn't see you
You say that every time
You missed the alumni gathering
Alumni?
Nobody called me No?
No!
Grade school or high school?
Grade school
Here, you know the drill
Is this really necessary?
No need to leap off a building over a card game
I told you to quit gambling
I hate bailing you out in the middle of the night
You can't count on me much longer
I've decided to retire
Retirement?
You're kidding!
You know my wife is losing her mind and she's getting worse
Last week she grabbed someone's baby and refused to return it
She even bit the mother's hand
She's getting worse.
Understand?
If I carry on with you two
We'II all end up in jail sooner or later
Who'll take care of her then?
That was 20 years ago
You keep saying that!
I'm still responsible for what happened
What kind of father was I?
My son had high fever for 2 days
I didn't realise it was meningitis
I'm responsible for his death
We have no children.
There is no hope
What else can I do?
Have another one
I can get Viagra at half price
OK?
Don't provoke him any more
Don't tell me what to do
It's time...
Straighten your shirt
Honey, you're late!
No.
I'm not
You were at the top of the stairs yesterday
Now you're only on the third.
You don't love me anymore?
I'II hurry tomorrow
I love you very much
Your son
Hey!
Did you pay your rent?
Of course!
Ask him
They did
They're always sneaking around
What's the matter with them?
Don't hang out with them anymore
What?
She knows about us?
We must do something about that
You're more capable than my Dad
I am not even fit to tie his shoelaces
He's one of the richest men in Asia
If I'm half the man he is it'd be wonderful
Dad will like you very much
I'm sure I'll like him very much too and you, of course
Is my English getting better?
I need to grab a cigar from the car
Enjoy your dinner
Yan., .
Keep an eye on her
Stop right there!
What the hell?
What's wrong with you?
You can't come here dressed as a chicken!
Think with your head if you want to spy on me
Forget it, I want a divorce
I'm working
I know that.
You'd better not be doing this for fun
I came because Fanny told me she saw you
Who's that inside?
Obviously she's a woman
My clients are either men or women
Can I only have male clients?
Divorce me if you don't trust me
You haven't been home for months.
I miss you
Why?
I was stupid enough to marry you at 18
Look at this mess
I can't breathe
Never mind.
Let's divorce
I'm sorry
Sorry for what?
You have done me no wrong
Just feel sorry for yourself
Go back to school if you have time
If you know any better
You won't be dressed like this
What's the key to a marriage?
Trust
Space
You're suffocating me
I want a divorce
I can't
I'm pregnant
What?
Come again?
I'm pregnant
No way!
When was the last time...
You were drunk that night and forgot to put on,
How could you?
You should have kicked me out of bed
I am ignorant about birth control
Really!
You know how I am with kids
I don't like them.
If we have a child
We'II have no more privacy
Are you sure?
Have you checked?
You can't be more than 3 months pregnant
Don't waste any time
Get an abortion in Shenzhen
You can't afford to wait
I love you!
Hurry!
You can't walk to Shenzhen dressed like that
Take a bus
Go back inside...
Tell me where is Thongs
He's dead
Don't get upset.
Mind your health
The usual...
Spray paint and take some pictures
Shut the door and windows while you eat.
OK?
Don't be mad
Sorry about that
Hey, Thongs Stay away from him
Came to visit your father?
Y es
He's a disgrace to the village.
Ignore him
PAY UP!
Please move along.
Lady

Hurry,
What's going on?

But you were in hiding.
Pal
How else can we find you?
What are you doing?

What's the occasion?
Everyone is here

This is for you
This is for you
Here's the pillow you wanted and your heater
This is for you.
Dad
A massager to ease your back pains
Why did you come back?
I thought you were dead
Stop cursing me like that.
Dad
Look at you, a punk!
You were not like this when you were born
I wanted you to be a doctor or lawyer
I sent you to the best schools
But you turned out to be a loser
I may not be a lawyer, but I'm still your son
I wanted to be a professional, too
Even the President.
But I'm not cut out for it
Your mother and I saved up every dime to put you through school
I tried.
I just can't do it
Don't be so stubborn
Me?
Stubborn?
I'm doing alright, Look at me
The hell you are
What have you been doing?
Gambling!
I'm a business man
Business?
What business?
Whoring and gambling?
You're a crook
You're nothing but a cheat
All you want is for me to make money
Don't start...
I'm making money now
I bought you everything you wanted
What's wrong with that?
I earned every penny
Money isn't everything
I want you to be an honest man
I did nothing wrong
I don't know... what have I done?
What did I do wrong?
I wonder about these things
How and where you got them from
You probably stole them!
Take them away!
Out!
Dad,
Here, throw this away as well
Get out!
You'd better go You're not my son
I don't have an unworthy son like you
Nobody wants to see you
Take them away!
PAY UP!
Honey!
What is it, Honey?
Is this our bedroom?
Yes.
Of course.
Are you sure?
Yes.
It's our bedroom
We've been robbed!
What?
There's been a burglary!
Goddamn it.
Who did this?
It's OK...
Honey
At least our baby is safe
I'II clean up this mess.
OK?
A burglary!
Landlord
What is it, Uncle?
I heard you're retiring, Made enough already?
I have a big one for you.
Interested?
I never said I'm retiring.
I'll take any job
Meet for a card game, Thongs 22:00, the usual place
Don't buy a car if you can't afford it
I was just kidding
This is for your troubles You always make me do this
Stop being agitated No
Treat yourself to a massage No!
Come on... take it No!
Be like that, you goddamn midget!
You'll be towing cars for the rest of your life and you'II have a midget son like you!
Did you crack my refrigerator.
Octopus?
Is Thongs coming?
What time is it?
There's a big job, I can't decide
I feel we should,
Been painting again?
Must you always wear white?
Did you crack my refrigerator?
Why are you so upset?
The paint is on me!
You should see what I did to those thugs
What were you saying?
We have an assignment
I can't make up my mind
I'II do anything
This is really complicated
Though we'II be paid $7 million,
What?
What?
$7 million?
$7 million?
To do what?
Just hear me out,
Cut the crap, let's do it Listen to me,
I'II do anything for $7 million $7 million.
You've got to be kidding!
Start the car, Mind the door!
Watch where you're going
Help me
Landlord...
Give me a hand
You don't have to come with us
I must do this myself
Why is this such a big deal?
Never mind
Just open the door for me.
I'll wait down here
Nothing!
I bet they wore the jewellery
Just some foreign currency left
You're kidding,
Where's Landlord?
Probably cracking another safe
What a small world!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Just taking him back to his grandpa
Whose grandpa?
Shut up!
What?
You lied to me too?
What did you feed him?
What is it?
There's a break-in!
Uncle, it's done
Is it Lobster Bay?
Roger that
Do you know what you're doing?
We agreed no raping, looting arson and murder
This is someone else's family feud, stay out
We take the baby to his Grandpa
All it takes is 15 minutes for a blood test
What did you feed him?
Nothing
Just sedative to help him sleep
Are you crazy?
You fed sedative to a baby!
Even burglars have ethics
You taught us that.
Remember?
Ethics is for reference only
We need to improvise all the time
You should've told us the job involves a baby
I told you we need to talk but once you heard about the $7 million you pushed me into the car and you even congratulated me
You didn't give me a chance
No way
What are you doing?
Take him back How can you say that?
I dare you to repeat that!
Take him back!
Who supported you all these years?
Who supported you all these years?
Who taught you to pick a lock?
And who taught you to crack a safe?
What will become of you without me?
You're nothing but a loser
And you, a womanizer
I'm sorry... do you know what happened to me?
Do you have any idea?
You know my wife is nuts
And I can barely see these days
I'm going blind, Do you understand?
K. Now why I had to do this myself?
Why must I do this?
Use your imagination
Rings any bell?
I've been robbed!
Some bastards cleaned out my $3 million!
I have nothing left,
Who'll support me?
Will you do it?
Can you support me?
Even I get burgled
I'm supposed to be a pro, Now I have nothing!
I can manage on my own
I know I can!
I don't need your help
Landlord
Get in
Let's go home and get some sleep
If I wasn't driving this piece of shit
You'll be eating my dust
Get out of the way, asshole!
If I let you overtake me in that car
I'm a real son of a bitch
Stop this nonsense!
Careful with the kid
Are you crazy?
Let him pass
Hello?
Uncle?
Are you there yet?
Almost.
And you?
5 more minutes
Some asshole is blocking the road
We're dueling with an asshole too
Don't be late, the buyer is punctual
No problem
Be careful and lose that asshole quick
Don't worry

Where is the poodle?
Oh my God!
It's the wrong bus!
Sorry...
Picture perfect!
Give me a kiss!
It's your fault!
Are you alright?
Thanks
Don't hold him like that
Careful with his arm!
You're just plain negligent!
Leaving him behind on the bus
Can you help me?
Octopus!
I don't believe this!
How can he miss out by a whisker?
I should have known better
I lose money on him every time
I do the dishes, you take a bath
Let's take a bath together, OK?
I'm rich!
I've won.
At last
Isn't it fun?
Hey!
Can you believe this?
Thanks so much.
Melody
If not for you
We wouldn't know what to do with him
Octopus and I are grateful
Actually.
I'm very grateful...
So that's how he was revived
Yan...
Did you do what I told you to do?
You don't have to go if you're busy
Should I call her?
Was I too harsh?
This is Yan, I can't come to the phone right now
Leave a message at the beep
Alan!
Long time no see, Thongs
Your baby?
Hey, stop it!
Carry on,
Come...
Be a good boy!
Don't do that!
Thongs.
What's your game?
Get out if you're not playing!
Don't bring a kid in here!
Get lost!
Life is complicated.
You are what you eat
What you feed and teach stay with him for life
You must take this seriously
Thongs.
Are you in or not?
Go home and babysit!
Get lost!
I'm not playing
Loser!
Cleaned out already?
No.
He was crying too much
Yes.
That's a good boy
How about just one bet?
Just one?
No more gambling
I quit., .
You're worse than my Dad!
I really don't know
I've been calling Landlord all night
I'm a man of my word
I'II fix it for you
I just want the boy!
Let me out...
Is this a joke?
Landlord has 2 partners in crime
Thongs and Octopus
Let me out!
Thongs and Octopus
I don't care what you do, find them
I found them.
Boss.
They're inside Very good!
Now we change the diaper
Are you Thongs?
Give me the baby
What baby?
Don't play dumb
I don't know any Uncles
Don't play dumb with me
What is it?
They're looking for Baby
My name is Baby, looking for me?
Damn!
You're asking for it!
Go!
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
I just over jumped
What did they say?
Who cares?
Let's go
Remember?
Yes
Ring the bell.
When he opens the door,
I'II splash the paint on your cue
Let him have it!
Yes
Wait!
Thongs.
Don't hide behind women and babies
I won't spare you!
I don't understand a word you're saying
Thongs is my buddy
He's not here right now.
Come back later
No problem.
We'II wait for him inside
He's my kid brother
Nice to meet you
There's no one here
Fanny, I'm scared
Is it worse than abortion?
Ask him about the future?
Confront him with the ultrasound
Be good
Who are you looking for?
Octopus
He is not here, come back later
You'd better come in first
Thongs
Make sure the baby is home
What's that look on your face?
Toothache
Why is Octopus off in such a hurry?
He needs to use the toilet
You live here?
Y es
I love to come up for a chat
Steve!
Octopus!
Thongs,
You've finally shown up!
I'm tired of leaving messages on you voicemail
Leave!
I'll tend to you later
Come here,
Where's the baby?
In your room.
Who are they?
Decorators
My flat is a mess
What's with the paint?
We're renovating, just trying out the colors
What is it, Yan?
Oh.
No!
Talk to the officer
What is it, Miss?
Thongs...
The police can help you with any problem
There's a cop in there!
Go to the roof
Sit down and tell me your problem
Meet my good friend
Inspector Steve Mok
He's my... cousin
He's my... other cousin
We came to show him... the color sample
Your face,
I'm into body art
What's with all the baby stuff?
You know my pal Octopus,
He's a born womanizer
He got someone pregnant
Can't do much about that
Where is he now?
In the toilet
I need to go too
You do?
I'm investigating a break-in
K. Now anything about it?
I've quit long time ago
Octopus.
Inspector wants to have a word
Hurry up
Octopus...
What took you so long?
You're here?
Your turn
Not after him, it stinks in there
You have a friend in there
Friend?
He's my cousin too
I'm the eldest
Then let's reminisce
Never met each other?
Of course they have
Take care of this, Octopus
Why are you still here?
I want a divorce!
What the hell is this?
Never mind.
I want a divorce
You...
And you,
It sounds complicated
Yes.
Very complicated
Thongs.
We've been friends for so long
I didn't know you have cousins of different races
My Dad was a sailor,
He must have stopped in India
That'II make him your brother
That's not right
Maybe the sailor was his Grandpa
Or his mother's father
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
I have occasional muscle spasms
Muscle spasms?
Well?
Cramps,
You're probably possessed!
Give me a hand
Baby,
Hold on...
Help me.
Thongs!
Give us a hand!
I'd like to...
I can use my mouth
Catch!
Beat it!
You won't get away with this!
You have a lot of nerve.
Thongs
Hurry up!
Oh no!
They're inside.
Go get them!
Mind your head!
You're so greedy
Listen to me, Steve
You can confess at the station
I'II turn myself in afterwards
Who'd believe you?
Are you alright?
Just worry about yourself!
Don't hit my head
Thongs!
Stay back!
Should have listened to me
I'II get you, Thongs!
Octopus!
Run!
Come back!
Alright...
Get up!
After the truck!
Stop!
Stop!
Police!
I need to use your bike!
Go...
What?
It's not mine
I'm on learner's permit
I'II ask the Commissioner to grant you a proper license!
Go!
Really?
Yes!
Mind if I ask,
What did you use to drive?
I'm just a video gamer!
Shit!
Someone is tailing us
Looks like a robber to me
In broad daylight?
Now what?
Don't worry.
Call Headquarters
Ask for back up
Come in.
Headquarters...

But you grabbed me...
Just occupational reflex

Measles.
He won't drink his milk
Boil some carrots water chestnuts and barley

What?
Just tell his mother to make it
His mother?
She ran off
What about his mother,
His mother?
Gone as well

Check the temperature with the back of your hand or you'II scald him.
Understand?
Also, everyday at noon,
He needs his orange juice.
Get it?
He chokes easily since he has no teeth even crushed fruits will choke him
If you feed him solid food.
You must chew,
Don't be such a nag
Also
Hold him with your left arm or he'II cry
Give him congee in the afternoon
Chop up some lean pork, finely diced
Not too cold.
Not too hot
Serve in two separate bowls
Okay.
Okay.
Just hand him over
Alright
Be careful I will
Here, take this bottle too

You should go if you want to stay alive
Give me a smile
You're my grandson, understand?
Alright...
As soon as we get the result
The 3 of us are going to Brazil
Who are you?
I only want the baby
Nothing else matters
It's awful to separate him from his mom
Awful?
What about my dead son?
Max lost his mother when he was a child
I promised him his own amusement park
It's finished now
I also promised him a race track
But it's only half complete and that bitch killed him
I already lost a son
I'm not going to lose my grandson
This child, is my only hope for living
If you feel this way.
Think about his mother
She must be feeling the same
Why must you separate them?
What if he's not your grandson?
What'll happen then?
The lab report, Master
You can go
What's going on?
What is he doing?
I'm not really sure
I found the boy
But he's not your son
Don't do this, Master
Prepare the medication
Mind your health, sir
Watch him
Take the kid with you
Easy, Don't shut the door!
Let him keep you company
Be careful.
Master
Give him a hand
Where's the baby?
Give us the baby!
I want my baby
Don't!
Take your money and leave
I'm turning this place into an ice palace!
A big one
A gigantic ice palace Master
Gigantic ice palace

What's the matter with you?
See for yourself
You're useless

Why are you still here?
Throw them out!
Can you do this?
Thank God
Round and round and round he goes!
Goddamn baldie!

Gorge yourself!
Feed them something extra
See if you can open the door
There's no key hole to pick...
It can't be opened from inside
Thongs!
Octopus?
Are you alright, Thongs?
Open the door!
Only the Master knows the combination
What?
Only he can open it?
You saw him, He has gone mad
You're on.
Landlord, Do your stuff
How?
It's a Swiss computerized mechanical lock 8 layers with over 4 million combinations
Same kind used by the C IA
Save your breath.
Open it while I call the cops
Run for it,

The machines are too loud
Turn off the machines and the refrigerator
Unplug the refrigerator and the air conditioning
K. Ill the air conditioning
Everybody, hold your breath
What?
Hold your breath!
Silence!
Well?
Is it open?
Why doesn't the door pop open?
Pops open?
Don't touch it!
Why doesn't it pop open?
Because of this?
It has nothing to do with something so intricate
Damn...
It's opened!
What took you so long?
Save the baby
Save him...
How is he?
Save the baby
You promised me reduced sentence
Alright...

Honey!
Take care of yourself
I thought money was important, but I was wrong
If there's reincarnation...
I still want you for my wife
We'II have 10 kids.
OK?
I love you
While I'm in jail
I missed you every single second
I now know how awful you must have felt when I was wild and unruly
I'm really sorry
If I have the chance to start over,
I'II cherish you more
All I did was gamble and caused you a lot of trouble
I've been dealt a lousy hand
I thought if I had money
I'II earn respect and own the world
Now I've learnt my lesson at the expense of my beloved family
I'm sorry.
Dad
Goodbye
We'II have lots of kids and play in the garden
All of us will race each other
May the Lord forgive your sins
In the name of the Father.
The Son and the Holy Ghost.
Amen
We'II have our own children
We play in the backyard while you make dinner,
And do our laundry
Fire!
The government policy back then was very strict with the death penalty
It was only used on convicts who have committed serious crimes
What you have just witnessed are different forms of the death penalty
I'm sure you now have a better understanding
Let's have another round of applause for our inmates who gave us the demonstration
Well done!
Thank you!
Please help yourselves to the refreshments
Hi there!
How are you, Landlady?
You were great, Thongs
Where's Dad?

Honey, I have adopted 10 kids
From South Africa, the Middle East.
Germany,
Anyone from Cameroon?
Let me see...
I'm so happy
Don't over exert yourself.
You're pregnant
Let me carry that...
Don't frown.
It's bad for the baby
Speak for yourself
The doctor said the baby is doing great
I almost forgot my appointment
With a man or a woman?
My clients are either men or women
I can only meet with women?
No
Space.
Remember?
Yes...
I have plenty of space here
Alright...
Thanks for coming
Thanks for taking care of my Dad
How are you getting along?

Landlord...
Give me a hand
You don't have to come with us
I must do this myself
Why is this such a big deal?
Never mind
Just open the door for me, I'll wait down here
Nothing!
I bet they wore the jewellery
Just some foreign currency left
You're kidding...
Where's Landlord?
Probably cracking another safe
What a small world!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Just taking him back to his grandpa
Whose grandpa?
Shut up!
What?
You lied to me too?
What did you feed him?
What is it?
There's a break-in!
Uncle, it's done
Is it Lobster Bay?
Roger that
Do you know what you're doing?
We agreed no raping, looting arson and murder
This is someone else's family feud, stay out
We take the baby to his Grandpa
All it takes is 15 minutes for a blood test
What did you feed him?
Nothing
Just sedative to help him sleep
Are you crazy?
You fed sedative to a baby!
Even burglars have ethics
You taught us that, remember?
Ethics is for reference only
We need to improvise all the time
You should've told us thejob involves a baby
I told you we need to talk but once you heard about the $77 million you pushed me into the car and you even congratulated me
You didn't give me a chance
No way
What are you doing?
Take him back How can you say that?
I dare you to repeat that!
Take him back!
Who supported you all these years?
Who supported you all these years?
Who taught you to pick a lock?
And who taught you to crack a safe?
What will become of you without me?
You're nothing but a loser
And you, a womanizer
I'm sorry... do you know what happened to me?
Do you have any idea?
You know my wife is nuts
And I can barely see these days
I'm going blind.
Do you understand?
Know why I had to do this myself?
Why must I do this?
Use your imagination
Rings any bell?
I've been robbed!
Some bastards cleaned out my $3 million!
I have nothing left...
Who'll support me?
Will you do it?
Can you support me?
Even I get burgled
I'm supposed to be a pro.
Now I have nothing!
I can manage on my own
I know I can!
I don't need your help
Landlord
Get in
Let's go home and get some sleep
If I wasn't driving this piece of shit
You'll be eating my dust
Get out of the way, asshole!
If I let you overtake me in that car
I'm a real son of a bitch
Stop this nonsense!
Careful with the kid
Are you crazy?
Let him pass
Hello?
Uncle?
Are you there yet?
Almost, and you?
5 more minutes
Some asshole is blocking the road
We're dueling with an asshole too
Don't be late, the buyer is punctual
No problem
Be careful and lose that asshole quick
Don't worry
I'm not nicknamed King of Monza for nothing
See you there!
Boss
I just want to know if the baby is ours
The others can go to hell
Listen, only the kid!
Yes, Boss
Excuse me, sir!
You were speeding
Please wait here
See?
What did I tell you?
For everyone's information my license has been revoked 3 times
Your license has been revoked?
What's that got to do with being burglars?
You need to drive the get-away car, pal
Get ready to swap
If things go wrong, kill the others
We only want the kid
The hardware's all loaded Brilliant!
Don't suck on it, blow!
Roll down the window, sir.
Thank you

Why is it so dark?
You forgot the lights!
You call this driving?
Check the kid
The kid?
I held onto him the whole time
Okay...
I'm stuck
Can you move?
No, don't mind me
The cops are coming, take the kid
To where?
Your place?
Are you mad?
Don't let my wife see him
What then?
Just go
Hurry, the cops are coming
They're coming...

He's gone to eat fondue
What kind of fondue?
Where?
Shenzhen
For how long?
A month... no, a week
A week?
That'll kill him
Stop!
Landlady...
Baby!
Landlady!
Landlord is having fondue for a day only, not a week
He's there to close a deal
A big one.
He'll be back soon
Yes...
I think he told me
That's right...
Look!

There's a break-in at Tycoon Li's Peak mansion
Excuse me, ofticer
I need a favor...
I have a request
Hello?
Turn on the TV, Thongs
Now!
Thanks
According to the latest financial reports...
The Li family's net worth is well over $50 billion
See that?
He's notjust a mongrel
He's a pedigree poodle
It's not regular price anymore
I'll jack it up when I get out
How long will it take?
A week at the most
I'm charged with dangerous driving 2 weeks tops
What?
Who'll look after him?
No one except you, understand?
Wait till I get out
Bye-bye!
A week!
My God...
It's not on!
Quiet...
Again?
What now?
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing?
It stinks!
I don't believe this
He didn't even have much to eat
Don't shove it to me!
There's shit everywhere
Eat this, come on...
Yeah, good boy...
Baby!
Baby!
Don't feed him just anything
How old is he?
How old?
Yes!
How old?
5 to 6 months, I can tell
Who's the father?
He is
I see...
I know your kind
Yes, that's what we are
Don't worry, I have nothing against your kind
But men are so careless
Not this!
This is for 3 year-olds
No, this one doesn't have DHA
This is extra large!
His pee will leak from the side
No!
This is for breast enlargement
I need that, he wants a betterfeel
Don't complicate matters, just hurry!
Life is complicated
You are what you eat
What you feed and teach stay with him for life
You must take this seriously
Let me give you a lesson
I'll show you
Enough!
Just hurry!
Whose napkins are these?
Napkins?
One with wings and one without...
One for day, one for night, which is it?
I want night time with no wings
Day time with wings for me
Just hurry...
Ready?
Yes!
Drink this!
Is it too thick?
This is it
Hurry
Thanks!
We'll each take a class
Alright!
Thanks
Over there, sir!
Help me please!
1... 2... 3
Sit down and relax
I don't get it, can you show me again?
Carry on
Go home and teach your wife
Keep your back straight
Tighten your thighs and buttocks
Straighten the back?
Yes
Is this straight enough?
Look!
It's straight...
Keep it flat and straight
He's so cute!
Yes!
How old is he?
A few months, I think
A few months?
He's big
Where's his mother?
At work
You look after him alone?
That's wonderful!
So cute and loveable
We could have caught a taxi if you'd hurried
Shut up, alright?
What a coincidence!
You just got oft?
No, I work at the hospital
This isjust part time
Chatting her up?
She was our instructor
What a cute baby!
Excuse me!
Where are you?
I'm with your Mom
Really?
Put her on
What?
I can't hear you.
Call me back
Hello?
Hello!
Bitch!
Thank you...
Do stay in touch...
Bye-bye
You're not local?
I'm from Shaanxi
A student nurse on exchange
Dad had a stroke!
What?
He's in the hospital
Is it serious?
He's out of intensive care
I'll drop by after work
Hurry!
Yes...
Where do you work?
Me?
This is my stop, talk to you later
Let's go!
I'm charged with running a road block, resisting arrest and dangerous driving
They're refusing bail
But the lawyer said I'll be out next week
Next week?
Keep feeding the pedigree poodle
We're supposed to feed him well
And don't hand him over to anyone
Where is the poodle?
Oh my God!
It's the wrong bus!
Sorry...
Picture perfect!
Give me a kiss!
It's yourfault!
Are you alright?
Thanks
Don't hold him like that
Careful with his arm!
You'rejust plain negligent!
Leaving him behind on the bus
Can you help me?
Octopus!
I don't believe this!
How can he miss out by a whisker?
I should have known better
I lose money on him every time
I do the dishes, you take a bath
Let's take a bath together, OK?
I'm rich!
I've won, at last
Isn't it fun?
Hey!
Can you believe this?
Thanks so much, Melody
If not for you
We wouldn't know what to do with him
Octopus and I are grateful
Actually, I'm very grateful...
So that's how he was revived
Yan...
Did you do what I told you to do?
You don't have to go if you're busy
Should I call her?
Was I too harsh?
This is Yan, I can't come to the phone right now
Leave a message at the beep
Alan!
Long time no see, Thongs
Your baby?
Hey, stop it!
Carry on...
Come...
Be a good boy!
Don't do that!
Thongs, what's your game?
Get out if you're not playing!
Don't bring a kid in here!
Get lost!
Life is complicated, you are what you eat
What you feed and teach stay with him for life
You must take this seriously
Thongs, are you in or not?
Go home and babysit!
Get lost!
I'm not playing
Loser!
Cleaned out already?
No, he was crying too much
Yes, that's a good boy
How aboutjust one bet?
Just one?
No more gambling
I quit...
You're worse than my Dad!
I really don't know
I've been calling Landlord all night
I'm a man of my word
I'll fix it for you
I just want the boy!
Let me out...
Is this a joke?
Landlord has 2 partners in crime
Thongs and Octopus
Let me out!
Thongs and Octopus
I don't care what you do, ftnd them
I found them, Boss.
They're inside Very good!
Now we change the diaper
Are you Thongs?
Give me the baby
What baby?
Don't play dumb
I don't know any Uncles
Don't play dumb with me
What is it?
They're looking for Baby
My name is Baby, looking for me?
Damn!
You're asking for it!
Go!
What's the matter with you?
Nothing, I just overjumped
What did they say?
Who cares?
Let's go
Remember?
Yes
Ring the bell, when he opens the door...
I'll splash the paint on your cue
Let him have it!
Yes
Wait!
Thongs, don't hide behind women and babies
I won't spare you!
I don't understand a word you're saying
Thongs is my buddy
He's not here right now, come back later
No problem, we'll wait for him inside
He's my kid brother
Nice to meet you
There's no one here
Fanny, I'm scared
Is it worse than abortion?
Ask him about the future?
Confront him with the ultrasound
Be good
Who are you looking for?
Octopus
He is not here, come back later
You'd better come in ftrst
Thongs
Make sure the baby is home
What's that look on your face?
Toothache
Why is Octopus oft in such a hurry?
He needs to use the toilet
You live here?
Yes
I love to come up for a chat
Steve!
Octopus!
Thongs...
You've ftnally shown up!
I'm tired of leaving messages on you voicemail
Leave!
I'll tend to you later
Come here...
Where's the baby?
In your room.
Who are they?
Decorators
My ftat is a mess
What's with the paint?
We're renovating, just trying out the colors
What is it, Yan?
Oh, no!
Talk to the ofticer
What is it, Miss?
Thongs...
The police can help you with any problem
There's a cop in there!
Go to the roof
Sit down and tell me your problem
Meet my good friend
Inspector Steve Mok
He's my... cousin
He's my... other cousin
We came to show him... the color sample
Yourface...
I'm into body art
What's with all the baby stuff?
You know my pal Octopus...
He's a born womanizer
He got someone pregnant
Can't do much about that
Where is he now?
In the toilet
I need to go too
You do?
I'm investigating a break-in
Know anything about it?
I've quit long time ago
Octopus, Inspector wants to have a word
Hurry up
Octopus...
What took you so long?
You're here?
Your turn
Not after him, it stinks in there
You have a friend in there
Friend?
He's my cousin too
I'm the eldest
Then let's reminisce
Never met each other?
Of course they have
Take care of this, Octopus
Why are you still here?
I want a divorce!
What the hell is this?
Never mind, I want a divorce
You...
And you...
It sounds complicated
Yes, very complicated
Thongs, we've been friends for so long
I didn't know you have cousins of difterent races
My Dad was a sailor...
He must have stopped in India
That'll make him your brother
That's not right
Maybe the sailor was his Grandpa
Or his mother's father
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
I have occasional muscle spasms
Muscle spasms?
Well?
Cramps...
You're probably possessed!
Give me a hand
Baby...
Hold on...
Help me, Thongs!
Give us a hand!
I'd like to...
I can use my mouth
Catch!
Beat it!
You won't get away with this!
You have a lot of nerve, Thongs
Hurry up!
Oh no!
They're inside, go get them!
Mind your head!
You're so greedy
Listen to me, Steve
You can confess at the station
I'll turn myself in afterwards
Who'd believe you?
Are you alright?
Just worry about yourself!
Don't hit my head
Thongs!
Stay back!
Should have listened to me
I'll get you, Thongs!
Octopus!
Run!
Come back!
Alright...
Get up!
After the truck!
Stop!
Stop!
Police!
I need to use your bike!
Go...
What?
It's not mine
I'm on learner's permit
I'll ask the Commissioner to grant you a proper license!
Go!
Really?
Yes!
Mind if I ask...
What did you use to drive?
I'm just a video gamer!
Shit!
Someone is tailing us
Looks like a robber to me
In broad daylight?
Now what?
Don't worry, call Headquarters
Ask for back up

I called you about Dad's stroke
You're too busy to care
I'm sorry, Dad
Take good care of Dad
Are you alright?
The fever broke
The doctor said he'll be fine
Thanks
You don't have to worry
I...
You don't have to explain
No matter what
You saved his life
Wait here, I'll get his prescription

It's OK
There you are, Thongs
Don't do anything stupid
There's a baby...
Watch the baby!
I have a baby too
Let go
You let go
Together on a count to three 1 * 2 * 3
Don't cry
About the loan...
I'm not in the mood for that
But you grabbed me...
Just occupational reflex
What's wrong with your baby?
Measles.
He won't drink his milk
Boil some carrots water chestnuts and barley
Give him the juice
What?
Just tell his mother to make it
His mother?
She ran oft
What about his mother...
His mother?
Gone as well
Where did you get his clothes?
Anywhere
$80 at the convenient store, 10% oft
$72?
A further 10% oft with a discount card
That's $64.80
Do you have a discount card?
Here, take mine

You think she'll recognize him?
You're worried she'll recognize the baby?

Not so loud, you're waking him
Good baby

So happy and without a care in the world
Right?

Why do you trust me?
You know I'm a burglar still you made friends with me

Where is he?
Give me the baby!
Thirty...
Million...
Give me the baby
Listen...
Feed him milk every 4 hours
Check the temperature with the back of your hand or you'll scald him, understand?
Also, everyday at noon...
He needs his orange juice, get it?
He chokes easily since he has no teeth even crushed fruits will choke him
If you feed him solid food, you must chew...
Don't be such a nag
Also
Hold him with your left arm or he'll cry
Give him congee in the afternoon
Chop up some lean pork, ftnely diced
Not too cold, not too hot
Serve in two separate bowls
Okay, okay.
Just hand him over
Alright
Be careful I will
Here, take this bottle too
The temperature is right I got it...
Don't rock him too hard
It's time to feed him Enough
I wonder if he'll survive the night
What are you staring at?
Get lost
Come on, let's go
What are you doing?
Don't worry
They have doctors and nurses, he'll be fine
It's just family squabbles

Take the baby and go.
Don't mind me!
I doubt if he'll drop me
Thongs!
On the count to 10... and I'll let go
1 * 2... 6 * 7...
What?
What about 3 to 5?
8 * 9 * 10!
Stop!
Stop!
Get the baby!
Yes!
Who the hell invented free fall machines?
Master
What a cute baby
Give me a big smile...
You're my grandson
Don't cry, Mommie's here
Daddy's here...
Mommie's here
Daddy's here...
Mommie's here
Hold him with your left arm or he'll cry
Not bad
I understand why you're giving up your reward
But I'm keeping this baby
You should go if you want to stay alive
Give me a smile
You're my grandson, understand?
Alright...
As soon as we get the result
The 3 of us are going to Brazil
Who are you?
I only want the baby
Nothing else matters
It's awful to separate him from his mom
Awful?
What about my dead son?
Max lost his mother when he was a child
I promised him his own amusement park
It's ftnished now
I also promised him a race track
But it's only half complete and that bitch killed him
I already lost a son
I'm not going to lose my grandson
This child... is my only hope for living
If you feel this way, think about his mother
She must be feeling the same
Why must you separate them?
What if he's not your grandson?
What'll happen then?
The lab report, Master
You can go
What's going on?
What is he doing?
I'm not really sure
I found the boy
But he's not your son
Don't do this, Master
Prepare the medication
Mind your health, sir
Watch him
Take the kid with you
Easy...
Don't shut the door!
Let him keep you company
Be careful, Master
Give him a hand
Where's the baby?
Give us the baby!
I want my baby
Don't!
Take your money and leave
I'm turning this place into an ice palace!
A big one
A gigantic ice palace Master
Gigantic ice palace
A gigantic ice palace
What's the matter with you?
See for yourself
You're useless
That was quick!
You saw them?
Yes, I saw them both...
Why are you still here?
Throw them out!
Can you do this?
Thank God
Round and round and round he goes!
Goddamn baldie!
Octopus, the baby hasn't cried for a while
I'm aware of it!
Baldie...
I hate bald heads
It's fresh
Baby!
Octopus!
Baby...
Baby!
Baby...
How is he?
Take off yourjacket
Baby, hang in there!
You'll be alright
Baby...
Go!
Put it on!
Baby...
Catch!
Turn it up
Gorge yourself!
Feed them something extra
See if you can open the door
There's no key hole to pick...
It can't be opened from inside
Thongs!
Octopus?
Are you alright, Thongs?
Open the door!
Only the Master knows the combination
What?
Only he can open it?
You saw him.
He has gone mad
You're on, Landlord.
Do your stuff
How?
It's a Swiss computerized mechanical lock 8 layers with over 4 million combinations
Same kind used by the CIA
Save your breath, open it while I call the cops
Run for it...
Stop!
Hey, come back!
Be quiet!
Freeze!
The machines are too loud
Turn oft the machines and the refrigerator
Unplug the refrigerator and the air conditioning
Kill the air conditioning
Everybody, hold your breath
What?
Hold your breath!
Silence!
Well?
Is it open?
Why doesn't the door pop open?
Pops open?
Don't touch it!
Why doesn't it pop open?
Because of this?
It has nothing to do with something so intricate
Damn...
It's opened!
What took you so long?
Save the baby
Save him...
How is he?
Save the baby
You promised me reduced sentence
Alright...
The car!
Don't die on me!
The car...
Hot-wired it!
Don't scare me, Baby...
Come get your milk
Baby!
Wake up for milk
Mommie's here, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid...
Baby...
Don't die on me
Come drink your milk.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up, Baby
Pop the hood, use the engine
Engine... in the back!
1, 2!
3!
1, 2, 3!
Wake up...
One more time!
1 * 2 * 3!
Take them away
Bring your men and block the exits
Don't let anyone through
Yes, sir!
Baby...
Come back!
Never mind
Hurry, please...
Pulse rate 80 BPM
Max
This is the police!
Max, come home
I want to play with you...
Just calm down!
Max...
Sorry, Honey!
Take care of yourself
I thought money was important, but I was wrong
If there's reincarnation...
I still want you for my wife
We'll have 10 kids, OK?
I love you
While I'm in jail
I missed you every single second
I now know how awful you must have felt when I was wild and unruly
I'm really sorry
If I have the chance to start over...
I'll cherish you more
All I did was gamble and caused you a lot of trouble
I've been dealt a lousy hand
I thought if I had money
I'll earn respect and own the world
Now I've learnt my lesson at the expense of my beloved family
I'm sorry, Dad
Goodbye
We'll have lots of kids and play in the garden
All of us will race each other
May the Lord forgive your sins
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen
We'll have our own children
We play in the backyard while you make dinner...
And do our laundry
Fire!
The government policy back then was very strict with the death penalty
It was only used on convicts who have committed serious crimes
What you have just witnessed are different forms of the death penalty
I'm sure you now have a better understanding
Let's have another round of applause for our inmates who gave us the demonstration
Well done!
Thank you!
Please help yourselves to the refreshments
Hi there!
How are you, Landlady?
You were great, Thongs
Where's Dad?
You did a great job, Honey
I was so scared
It wasn't real, silly
What about the I love you part?
Of course that's for real
Honey...
I have adopted 10 kids
From South Africa, the Middle East, Germany...
Anyone from Cameroon?
Let me see...
I'm so happy
Don't over exert yourself, you're pregnant
Let me carry that...
Don't frown, it's bad for the baby
Speak for yourself
The doctor said the baby is doing great
I almost forgot my appointment
With a man or a woman?
My clients are either men or women
I can only meet with women?
No
Space, remember?
Yes...
I have plenty of space here
Alright...
Thanks for coming
Thanks for taking care of my Dad
How are you getting along?
There's nothing to it, it's not my ftrst time
But I promise you it'll be my last
Why are you making promises to me?
I...
I promise my Dad
Thongs
Inspector
You have to thank your lucky stars
The Justice Department may put you on parole
Thanks Thanks
Look who's here to see you
Baby
Baby...
Over here...
Go on
Give me a hug
Mommie
It's been a long time
Sorry we didn't have a chance to apologize
We're really very sorry
We know, if it hadn't been for you
Our baby could have died
I wonder if they'll be interested
About what?
About working for us
What?
You'll be in charge of security
You can be the bodyguard
You can the chauffeur
I'm perfect for thejob
Driving sports cars has to be my pet project
Are you interested?
Absolutely...
We'll wait for your discharge, then
Our Open Day is over
Time to return to your cell
Baby...
Yes?
Mrs. Li
We don't even know his name
It's Matthew
Ka Sing
Li Ka Sing?
So long!
Blindfold me, I can't bear to watch
How's Jackie?
Is he alright?
Bring me a towel
It hurts!
One more time
I get to keep this?
Action!
Help him up
The spine...
You should go for an X-ray
Bring the car
Bring the mattresses here
What are you doing over there?
Come on... over here
Over here
Careful...
Careful
Leave your card with my PA
She'll save you the best seat
When's the press conference?
I can't hear a word you're saying
Apply more honey
More
Stop, I can't stand this!
Thongs!
Steve, I didn't see you
You say that every time
You missed the alumni gathering
Nobody called me
Are you sure?
Grade school or college?
It's supposed to be High School!
Stop flufting your line!
It was a one-take!
Do you know how scary it was up there?
I now have to do it all over again!
I'll wring your neck for this!
Maybe the sailor was his Grandpa
Or his mother's father
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
I have occasional muscle spasms
Muscle spasms?
Well?
Cramps...
You're probably possessed!
Give me a hand
Baby...
Hold on...
Help me, Thongs!
Give us a hand!
I'd like to...
I can use my mouth
Catch!
Beat it!
You won't get away with this!
You have a lot of nerve, Thongs
Hurry up!
Oh no!
They're inside, go get them!
Mind your head!
You're so greedy
Listen to me, Steve
You can confess at the station
I'll turn myself in afterwards
Who'd believe you?
Are you alright?
Just worry about yourself!
Don't hit my head
Thongs!
Stay back!
Should have listened to me
I'll get you, Thongs!
Octopus!
Run!
Come back!
Alright...
Get up!
After the truck!
Stop!
Stop!
Police!
I need to use your bike!
Go...
What?
It's not mine
I'm on learner's permit
I'll ask the Commissioner to grant you a proper license!
Go!
Really?
Yes!
Mind if I ask...
What did you use to drive?
I'm just a video gamer!
Shit!
Someone is tailing us
Looks like a robber to me
In broad daylight?
Now what?
Don't worry, call Headquarters
Ask for back up
Come in, Headquarters...
This is 3321, Daniel calling
Suspected robbery in progress!
Stop the car, kid!
Who are you calling a kid?
I can tell that you're a thief!
Having serious fun?
I'II...
Ram your butt!
Move closer...
Easy, slow down a bit...
What?
Another one?
On a motorbike?
Stop the car!
Stop
He's cute!
Hop over!
The Commissioner will be in touch
Bye!
That way!
After him!
Free the pushchair!
Do you think I'm sunbathing?
Almost there!
Move closer...
Stop!
Turn...
Turn... ram him!
Thank God!
Watch out!
You call yourself a driver?
Thank God!
That was close
Everything's ftne
Back up was quick!
Thanks to you
Where are you from?
I'm from Broke Broke Mountain!
I'm a cop, kid
I need to use your bike
You're nuts
I dare you to say that again
Everything is taken care of, keep in touch
Thanks
This is Octopus, if you need me...
Leave a message after the tone
ICU
Let's pay off Thongs' debts
Don't worry, Dad.
Here's my contribution
What happened to you?
Uncle...
You've turned into an ice-Iolly
Boss, I can explain...
We're men of honour...
We never renege
We always keep our word
Never break a promise
One for all, and...
All for you!

Thirty...
Million...
That's my ofter, take it or leave it
Money is nothing between you and me
Whatever you say
Who is it?
It's me
You're home!
Who's the kid?
He's crying like crazy
Check him out for me
Well?
You need to change him and he's running a fever
Fever?

What shall I do?
Take him to a doctor
Take him to a doctor?
Hurry!
Landlord?
I'm free
Thank God for that
Where are you now?
On my way to the hospital
Hospital?
What happened?
The baby is sick
Tell Octopus to meet us there
Thongs?
Be careful, Dad
What happened?
I called you about Dad's stroke
You're too busy to care
I'm sorry, Dad
Take good care of Dad
Are you alright?
The fever broke
The doctor said he'll be fine
Thanks
You don't have to worry
I...
You don't have to explain
No matter what
You saved his life
Wait here, I'll get his prescription
Thanks
It's OK
There you are, Thongs
Don't do anything stupid
There's a baby...
Watch the baby!
I have a baby too
Let go
You let go
Together on a count to three 1 * 2 * 3
Don't cry
About the loan...
I'm not in the mood for that
But you grabbed me...
Just occupational reflex
What's wrong with your baby?
Measles.
He won't drink his milk
Boil some carrots water chestnuts and barley
Give him the juice
What?
Just tell his mother to make it
His mother?
She ran oft
What about his mother...
His mother?
Gone as well
Where did you get his clothes?
Anywhere
$80 at the convenient store, 10% oft
$72?
A further 10% oft with a discount card
That's $64.80
Do you have a discount card?
Here, take mine
I'll forfeit today's interest
But I'll start chasing tomorrow

I have bargained for you for this poodle?
I give you 3 guesses
$30 millions
This $5 millions isjust the deposit
We deliver in 3 hours and we get $25 millions more!
It's too good to be true
Give him this glucose later
It's not necessary, now that his fever broke
What?
You two have become nannies now?
It can't be
What is this?
3 Ferraris
What are you thinking?
Your own casino, bigger than Monte Carlo
Come on!
Give us a chance
No matter what you want
We'll do it
Just don't hurt our baby
There's nothing to watch on TV
You think she'll recognize him?
You're worried she'll recognize the baby?
This baby is barely...
I need some fresh air
One of 100 a day
They all look the same
Everyone says he takes after his father, I disagree
She won't be able to tell, understand?

Don't be silly
You made me very happy
You're my most precious darling
Not so loud, you're waking him
Good baby
I'm returning him tomorrow
I have sorted out the baby formula
So nice to be a baby
Eat, sleep, drink and shit
So happy and without a care in the world
Right?
Right!
Why do you trust me?
You know I'm a burglar still you made friends with me
Actually...
The ftrst time I saw you
I knew you have a conscience
If you have a chance to start over
Will you still be a burglar?
It's too late for that now

Where is he?
Give me the baby!
Thirty...
Million...
Give me the baby
Listen...
Feed him milk every 4 hours
Check the temperature with the back of your hand or you'll scald him, understand?
Also, everyday at noon...
He needs his orange juice, get it?
He chokes easily since he has no teeth even crushed fruits will choke him
If you feed him solid food, you must chew...
Don't be such a nag
Also
Hold him with your left arm or he'll cry
Give him congee in the afternoon
Chop up some lean pork, ftnely diced
Not too cold, not too hot
Serve in two separate bowls
Okay, okay.
Just hand him over
Alright
Be careful I will
Here, take this bottle too
The temperature is right I got it...
Don't rock him too hard
It's time to feed him Enough
I wonder if he'll survive the night
What are you staring at?
Get lost
Come on, let's go
What are you doing?
Don't worry
They have doctors and nurses, he'll be fine
It's just family squabbles

Thongs!
Steve, I didn't see you
You say that every time
You missed the alumni gathering
Nobody called me
Are you sure?
Grade school or college?
It's supposed to be High School!
Stop flufting your line!
It was a one-take!
Do you know how scary it was up there?
I now have to do it all over again!
I'll wring your neck for this!

- Hi, who's this?
- It's Ivy.
Why are yöu still calling me?
Where are yöu?
Don't bother me with secular matters.
- Go to hell!
- Same to yöu.
If that can solve anything, I'll be a monk.
- Yöu'll burn in hell.
- Mind yöur language, dear.

Hi.
Me again.
Four, eight and three for races three, four and eight,
$1 0,000 each to place.
Recently, I've become enlightened.
One must reach for the sky with limited resources.
Too many women, too little time.
Going after them all... it's a losing game.
Therefore, I have decided to focus only on the wealthy ones.
The only way to get rich is to find a rich wife.
- Yes!
- Yöu think so too?
- Keep going.
- More?
- Go on.
- More?
Go on, go on...
Go on!
- Go on, go on!
- Don't, don't!
- Damn!
Lost by a whisker.
- Yöu'll gamble yöur life away.
- Get lost.
- lt's opened.
Why didn't yöu say so?
Not much here.
It hurts!
Relax, Mrs. Li.
Yöu must spread yöur legs.
Relax, open up.
Open them wide.
What are yöu doing?
Can't yöu read?
These laxatives cost $89.
Forget the cheap stuff.
Get Taxol.
They're for chemotherapy, $8,000 each.
Go for these.
Relax.
Now push, harder.
Push harder!
OK.
There we go.
See for yöurself, boy or girl?
- Hello.
- We're done.
We're coming down.
Rendezvous outside Block B.
"B" for Barcelona?
"B" for Boy.
Smart ass!
Block Boy it is.
"B" for Boy.
Act normal.
How?
I look like I'm pregnant, and yöu look like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Excuse me, tell me...
Don't ask.
Doctors can have humps and pot bellies.
Don't discriminate against the disabled.
Calling Control.
Hello.
Dr. Tsui?
Yes.
There's an emergency?
Run!
Split up.
Don't get caught, and don't spill the beans if yöu do.
- Hey!
Get out!
- Sorry!
Number three!
Number three!
Sorry.
I should've backed Nine!
I'm sure he'll make it.
Hang in there, Dad.
Pardon me.
Why, Dad?
Why?
Who are yöu?
Who is he?
Chan.
Sorry.
Wrong ward.
I was looking for a Wong.
I'm so sorry... excuse me.
Sorry.
- Doctor!
- Congratulations, Mrs. Li.
The baby is healthy and cute, 2.8 Kg.
- Really?
Let me...
- Yes.
Here, look how cute he is.
- How's my daughter-in-law?
- She's fine.
Everything went smoothly.
- Here she is.
- Mani!
How are yöu feeling?
Yöu did great!
Look!
He's so handsome.
- Just like me.
- Well?
Does it hurt?
Yöu must be tired, get some rest.
Get some rest.
So cute!
Back to yöu, Dr. Lee...
Mani.
They're on the third floor.
Let's take a look.
Max...
Remember what yöu promised me?
Yöu said... we'll go to Alaska, and get married in a white chapel.
Let's go now.
Marry me.
I'm married to Calvin.
- Give me the baby.
- Yöu don't mean it.
Listen, we're not meant for each other.
- Give me the baby...
- l can change for yöu!
Yöu're coming with me anyway.
Come back!
Hey, buddy.
The last race.
Back Number Six, not Nine.
- Six?
- Hey, yöu!
That's my form guide!
Move it!
Hang on, Mani.
Yöu're hurting me.
Give me Mani!
Are yöu alright?
Max!
Come back!
- Out of the way!
- Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop him by the elevator!
Back off!
Take it easy.
- Stay away!
- Cool it.
Stop all the escalators.
Go away!
First yöu took Mani, and now my son!
Yöu're no buddy of mine.
- Give me the baby.
- Go away!
Take it easy.
Calm down!
Don't do this.
Mani, leave with me.
We'll raise the kid together.
Yöu're crazy!
Give me my child.
Come with me!
Stop crying!
Calm down!
Stand back.
The baby...
No!
Let's get out of here.
Help her.
Hurry up, go.
- Grab hold of the baby.
- Watch out!
He's falling!
The baby!
Towels!
Get some towels!
Pull me up.
It's alright!
They got him.
Amazing!
Thanks.
Go help the baby!
Yöu dropped the drugs.
I told yöu to leave them!
There goes yöur Viagra.
- Go, go!
- Number Nine!
Again.
Whose bet is this?
- What's its capacity?
- This is for kids.
I'm asking yöu about its engine capacity.
Kids...
Don't worry, I'm just teasing yöu.
I had my eye on this one.
Here's my deposit.
Prepare the contract.
Ready...
Go!
Got it.
There.
If yöu can sense a hair, nothing can stop yöu.
Hair?
That's impossible.
- Nothing, just small change.
- Look!
These shark fins are enormous.
Let's beat it.
I don't want to get rabies!
Mummy, it's Superman!
Yoshihama abalone, Uncle!
$1 0,000 a piece.
- Over a hundred of them.
- That's more like it.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Player 3, dealer 7.
Dealer takes all.
- How much?
- $83,800.
Here.
Keep the change.
Why don't yöu use yöur credit card?
That's just her tip.
Credit Card... I'll look around again.
Wait for me at the door, OK?
- That's a discount card from a sushi store.
- l know.
We'll take these too.
Keep the change!
- Stop being a bad loser.
- lf yöu can't take losing, quit.
Pay me back, or yöu're dead.
I'll pay yöu back right away.
Why do yöu put the money in the refrigerator?
- Why?
- lt's our safe, don't yöu recognise it?
Honey, we lost our son years ago.
There's no point dwelling on it.
- Thanks.
- This label is fantastic.
But I've ordered something even better for yöu. lt'll be here soon.
Try this, Miss.
New tissue paper with floral fragrance.
Try the floral fragrance.
Thongs, pay up!
Come back!
MacDaddy!
Hi.
Yeah.
I like talking to yöu.
Not like yöur thugs.
All they do is fight.
Do yöu know why I like to borrow from yöu?
Yöu have compassion, sympathy and a conscience.
Am I right?
And smart, too.
I'll repay yöur $1 00,000 loan in 1 00 instalments, OK?
It's a deal.
I hate smooth talkers.
I have a living to make!
Don't come any closer.
MacDaddy, I was just kidding.
- Yöu think this is funny?
- Don't make me jump.
- Go ahead.
- Are yöu serious?
Jump!
Yöu don't want me dead, do yöu?
No, but yöu brought it upon yöurself.
- Get a camera and take a picture.
- Yes, Boss.
If I die, yöu can kiss yöur money goodbye.
It won't do either of us any good.
No, I think it's brilliant.
I've got so many bad debts lately.
This will show the others.
- Go on, jump.
- No, MacDaddy.
No?
Let's see...
No?
So yöu can read my mind?
I'm safe!
Come on.
Come and get me!
Yöu!
Take this!
I'll get yöu, Thongs!
What are yöu doing, pal?
Fixing the air-conditioning.
It's OK, go back in.
- Look, Boss.
Cops!
- Here they come.
Let's go.
Thongs.
Inspector Mok.
Sorry, I didn't see yöu.
Yöu say that every time.
Yöu missed the alumni gathering.
Alumni?
Nobody called me.
- No?
- No.
- Grade school or high school?
- Grade school.
Here, yöu know the drill.
is this really necessary?
No need to leap off a building over a card game.
Yöu're more capable than my Dad.
I'm not even fit to tie his shoelaces.
He's one of the richest men in Asia.
If I'm half the man he is it'd be wonderful.
Dad will like yöu very much.
I'm sure I'll like him very much too.
And yöu, of course.
is my English getting better?
I... need to grab a cigar from the car.
Enjoy yöur dinner.
Yan...
Keep an eye on her.
Stop right there!
What the hell?
What's wrong with yöu?
Yöu can't come here dressed as a chicken!
Think with yöur head if yöu want to spy on me.
- Forget it, I want a divorce.
- l'm working.
I know that.
Yöu'd better not be doing this for fun.
I came because Fanny told me she saw yöu.
Who's that inside?
Obviously, she's a woman.
Can I only have male clients?
Divorce me if yöu don't trust me.
Yöu haven't been home for months, I miss yöu.
Why?
I was stupid enough to marry yöu at 1 8.
Look at this mess.
I can't breathe.
Never mind, let's divorce.
- l'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
Yöu'd better not have done me wrong!
Yöu should feel sorry for yöurself.
Go back to school.
If yöu knew any better, yöu wouldn't be dressed like this.
What's the key to a marriage?
Trust.
Space.
I'm suffocating!
- l want a divorce.
- l can't.
- l'm pregnant.
- What?
What?
I'm pregnant.
No way!
When was the last time we...
Yöu were drunk that night and forgot to put one on.
How could yöu?
Yöu should have kicked me out of bed.
I am ignorant about birth control.
Really!
Yöu know how I am with kids.
I don't like them. lf we have a child, we'll have no more privacy.
Are yöu sure?
Have yöu checked?
Yöu can't be more than three months gone.
Don't waste any time.
Get an abortion in Shenzhen.
Yöu can't afford to wait.
I love yöu.
Now hurry.
Wait.
Yöu can't walk to Shenzhen dressed like that.
Take a bus.
Go back inside...
Tell me where Thongs is.
He's dead.
Don't get upset, mind yöur health.
It's just the usual...
Some paint and take some pictures.
Shut the door and windows while yöu eat, OK?
Don't be mad.
Sorry about that.
- Hey, Thongs.
- Stay away from him.
- Come to visit yöur father?
- Yes.
He's a disgrace to the village, ignore him.
Please move along, lady.
Easy...
Hurry...
What's going on?
- Just leave my family alone.
- But yöu were in hiding, pal.
How else can we find yöu?
What are yöu doing?
Hold on tight!
I'll pay when I can.
I'll kill yöu if yöu bother my family again.
Help him up.
What's the occasion?
Everyone is here.
Twins.
Look how tall yöu are, Ting!
Come, I brought presents.
These are all for yöu.
Take what yöu like.
This is for yöu.
This is for yöu.
Here's the pillow yöu wanted.
And yöur heater.
This is for yöu, Dad.
A massager to ease yöur back pains.
Why did yöu come back?
I thought yöu were dead!
Stop cursing me like that, Dad.
Look at yöu, a punk!
Yöu were not like this when yöu were born.
I wanted yöu to be a doctor or lawyer.
I sent yöu to the best schools.
But yöu turned out to be a loser.
I may not be a lawyer, but I'm still yöur son.
I wanted to be a professional, too.
Even the President, but I'm not cut out for it.
Yöur mother and I saved up every dime to put yöu through school.
I tried, I just can't do it.
Don't be so stubborn.
- Me?
Stubborn?
- l'm doing alright.
Look at me.
The hell yöu are.
What have yöu been doing?
Gambling!
- l'm a business man.
- Business?
What business?
Whoring and gambling?
Yöu're a crook.
Yöu're nothing but a cheat.
- All yöu want is for me to make money.
- Don't start.
I'm making money now.
I bought yöu everything yöu wanted.
What's wrong with that?
I earned every penny.
Money isn't everything.
I want yöu to be an honest man.
I did nothing wrong.
What have I done?
What did I do wrong?
I wonder about these things.
How and where yöu got them from.
Yöu probably stole them!
Take them away!
- Out!
- Dad!
- Here, throw this away as well.
- Get out!
- Yöu'd better go.
- Yöu're not my son.
I don't have an unworthy son like yöu.
Nobody wants to see yöu.
Take them away!
PAY UP!
Honey!
- What is it, Honey?
- ls this our bedroom?
- Yes, of course.
- Are yöu sure?
- Yes, it's our bedroom.
- We've been robbed!
- What?
- There's been a burglary!
- Goddamn it, who did this?
- lt's OK, Honey.
At least our baby is safe.
I'll clean up this mess, OK?
A burglary!
- Hello.
- Landlord.
- What is it, Uncle?
- l heard yöu're retiring.
Have yöu made enough already?
I have a big one for yöu, interested?
I never said I was retiring. I'll take any job.
Meet for a card game, Thongs.
22:00, the usual place.
- Don't buy a car if yöu can't afford it.
- Just fooling around.
- This is for yöur trouble.
- Yöu always make me do this.
- Stop being agitated.
- No.
- Treat yöurself to a massage.
- No!
- Come on, take it.
- No!
Be like that, yöu goddamn midget!
Yöu'll be towing cars for the rest of yöur life.
And yöu'll have a midget son just like yöu!
Did yöu crack my refrigerator, Octopus?
is Thongs coming?
What time is it?
There's a big job, I can't decide.
I feel we should...
Been painting again?
Must yöu always wear white?
Did yöu crack my refrigerator?
Why are yöu so upset?
The paint is on me!
Yöu should see what I did to those thugs.
What were yöu saying?
We have an assignment.
I can't make up my mind.
- l'll do anything.
- This is really complicated.
- Though we'll be paid $7 million...
- What?
What?
$7 million?
$7 million?
To do what?
- Just hear me out...
- Cut the crap, let's do it.
- Listen to me...
- l'll do anything for $7 million.
- $7 million, yöu've got to be kidding!
- Start the car...
Close the door!
Watch where yöu're going.
Help me.
- Landlord...
- Give me a hand.
- ..yöu don't have to come with us.
- l must do this myself.
- Why is this such a big deal?
- Never mind.
Just open the door for me, I'll wait down here.
Nothing!
I bet they wore the jewellery.
- Just some foreign currency left.
- Yöu're kidding!
Where's Landlord?
Probably cracking another safe.
Have I seen her before?
What's going on?
What are yöu doing?
Are yöu mad?
- Just taking him back to his grandpa.
- Whose grandpa?
- Shut up!
- What?
Yöu lied to me too?
What did yöu feed him?
- What is it?
- There's a break-in!
Uncle, it's done.
is it Lobster Bay?
Roger that.
Do yöu know what yöu're doing?
We agreed no raping, looting arson and murder.
This is someone else's family feud, stay out.
We take the baby to his Grandpa.
All it takes is a few minutes for a blood test.
- What did yöu feed him?
- Nothing.
- Just a sedative to help him sleep.
- Are yöu crazy?
Yöu fed a sedative to a baby!
Even burglars have ethics.
Yöu taught us that, remember?
Ethics are for reference only.
We need to improvise all the time.
Yöu should've told us the job involves a baby.
I told yöu we needed to talk, but once yöu heard about the $7 million, yöu pushed me into the car and yöu even congratulated me.
- Yöu didn't give me a chance.
- No way.
- What are yöu doing?
- Take him back.
How can yöu say that?
I dare yöu to repeat that!
- Take him back!
- Who supported yöu all these years?
Who supported yöu all these years?
Who taught yöu to pick a lock?
And who taught yöu to crack a safe?
What will yöu do without me?
Yöu're nothing but a loser.
And yöu, a womaniser.
I'm sorry, do yöu know what happened to me?
Do yöu have any idea?
Yöu know my wife is nuts.
And I can barely see these days.
I'm going blind.
Do yöu understand?
Know why I had to do this myself?
Why must I do this?
Use yöur imagination.
Rings any bell?
I've been robbed!
Some bastards cleaned out my $3 million!
I have nothing left...
Who'll support me?
Will yöu do it?
Can yöu support me?
Even I get burgled.
I'm supposed to be a pro.
Now I have nothing!
I can manage on my own.
I know I can!
I don't need yöur help.
Landlord.
Get in.
Let's go home and get some sleep.
If I wasn't driving this piece of shit, yöu'd be eating my dust.
Get out of the way, asshole!
If I let yöu overtake me in that car, I'm a real son of a bitch.
Stop this nonsense!
Careful with the kid.
Are yöu crazy?
Let him pass.
- Hello?
Uncle?
- Are yöu there yet?
- Almost, and yöu?
- Five more minutes.
- Some asshole is blocking my path.
- We're duelling with an asshole too.
- Don't be late, the buyer is punctual.
- No problem.
- Be careful and lose that asshole quickly.
- Don't worry.
I'm not nicknamed "King of Monza" for nothing.
See yöu there!
- Boss.
- l just want to know if the baby is ours.
The others can go to hell.
Listen, only the kid!
Yes, Boss.
Excuse me, sir!
Yöu were speeding.
Please wait here.
See?
What did I tell yöu?
For everyone's information, my license has been revoked 3 times.
Yöur license has been revoked?
What's that got to do with being a burglar?
Yöu need to drive the get-away car, pal.
Get ready to swap.
If things go wrong, kill the others.
We only want the kid.
- The hardware's all loaded.
- Brilliant!
Don't suck on it, blow!
Roll down the window, sir.
Roll down the window.
Thanks for yöur cooperation.
Please open the bag.
What's inside?
- What's inside?
- This bag?
Yes.
Please open it.
- Please, open it up.
- Sure.
Please cooperate, thank yöu.
- Back up!
I'm holding a gun, damn it!
- Yes, Boss.
Cut the posturing!
They're running the road block.
Give chase!
Go!
Run for it!
Go.
EU to headquarters.
A black sedan just fled from us.
The mini van is getting away.
Send a police van after them.
- Why is it so dark?
- Yöu forgot the lights!
- Yöu call this driving?
- Check the kid.
- The kid?
I held onto him the whole time.
- OK.
- l'm stuck.
- Can yöu move?
No, don't mind me.
The cops are coming, take the kid.
- To where?
Yöur place?
- Are yöu mad?
Don't let my wife see him.
- Where then?
- Just go.
- Hurry, the cops are coming.
- They're coming...
- l'll get out in a few days.
- Take care.
Go!
Control!
Traffic accident in Sai Kung.
Send an ambulance, someone's hurt.
And a fire truck.
Over!
We don't have the kid and we can't find Uncle.
I want that kid!
I want that kid!
If yöu can't find him, prepare for yöur own funeral.
Yes, Boss.
We'll fix it.
He hasn't stopped crying.
- What do yöu want?
- Just tell us.
- Humour him.
- Yöu do it.
No, yöu do it!
Hurry!
- Shut up!
Don't wake Landlady.
- What now?
- What are yöu doing?
- Putting him to sleep.
- Yöu'll kill him!
- What else can we do?
Let's close the windows.
Close the other one.
What the hell do yöu want?
- Hey!
What are yöu doing?
- He's fine, I left breathing space.
Where's yöur common sense?
Yöu'll kill him, he's just a baby.
- He'll be fine, I just want to muffle his noise.
- How can he be fine?
Hey, it works!
Carry on.
It's working!
Keep it up.
Yes!
Having fun?
Keep it up!
Try something else, yöu're getting boring.
- Now try another trick.
- Yöu didn't lock the door.
- What a surprise, Landlady!
- Landlady?
I heard a baby's cry.
Pretend that yöu're doing laundry.
is there a baby?
- No
- No?
Bite yöur tongue!
Where's my baby?
Don't yöu bully him.
There's yöur baby.
- What a sucker!
- Where's my Honey?
Where is he?
Landlord?
Where's my Honey?
Where is he?
- He's gone to eat fondue.
- What kind of fondue?
Where?
- Shenzhen.
- For how long?
- A month...
No, a week.
- A week?
That'll kill him.
Stop!
Landlady!
- Baby!
- Landlady!
Landlord is having fondue, for a day only, not a week.
He's there to close a deal.
- A big one.
He'll be back soon.
- Yes...
I think he told me.
- That's right.
- Look!
It's filthy!
I'll clean up.
I'll do it!
It'll attract cockroaches, I know.
- And here...
- l'll do it.
- l'll do it.
It's getting late.
Yöu should go to bed.
- Clean up this mess.
- Sure, we'll clean the whole place up.
- Don't forget yöur laundry.
- Bye.
Where's the kid?
- Damn!
It won't stop!
- Pull the plug!
Please don't cry!
I'm begging yöu.
I'll offer yöu a sacrifice.
- Damn!
Forgot to light it.
- Here's some chicken, it's great.
- Please don't cry.
- Babies don't eat chicken.
Please stop crying.
Pity my ear-drums!
Have some chicken!
I'll knock him out with this.

He'll sleep better drunk.

This is local news on the hour.
There was a break-in at Tycoon Li's Peak mansion.
Excuse me, officer. I need a favour.
I have a request.
Hello?
Turn on the TV, Thongs.
Now!
Thanks.
According to the latest financial reports the Li family's net worth is well over $50 billion.
See that?
He's not a mongrel.
He's a pedigree poodle.
It's not regular price anymore.
I'll jack it up when I get out.
How long will it take?
A week at the most.
I'm charged with dangerous driving.
2 weeks tops.
What?
Who'll look after him?
No one except yöu, understand?
Wait till I get out.
Bye-bye!
A week!
My God!
It's not on!
Quiet!
Again?
What now?
Are yöu out of yöur mind?
What are yöu doing?
- lt stinks!
- l don't believe this.
He didn't even have much to eat.
Don't shove it to me!
There's shit everywhere.
Eat this, come on.
Yeah, good boy.
Baby!
Baby!
Don't feed him just anything.
How old is he?
- How old?
- Yes!
- How old?
- 5 to 6 months, I can tell.
- Who's the father?
- He is.
I see. I know yöur kind.
Yes, that's what we are.
Don't worry, I have nothing against yöur kind.
But men are so careless.
Not this!
This is for 3 year-olds.
No, this one doesn't have DHA.
This is extra large!
His pee will leak from the side.
No!
This is for breast enlargement.
- l need that, he wants a better feel.
- Don't complicate matters, just hurry!
Life is complicated.
Yöu are what yöu eat.
What yöu feed and teach him will stay with him for life.
Yöu must take this seriously.
Yöu should come to a lesson.
- l'll show yöu.
- Enough!
Just hurry!
- Whose napkins are these?
- Napkins?
One with wings and one without.
One for day, one for night, which is it?
- l want night time with no wings.
- Day time with wings for me.
Hurry!
- Ready?
- Yes!
Drink this!
is it too thick?
- This is it.
- Hurry.
Thanks!
We'll each take a class.
Alright!
Thanks.
Over there, sir!
Help me please!
1 , 2, 3.
Sit down and relax.
- l don't get it, can yöu show me again?
- Carry on.
Go home and teach yöur wife.
Keep yöur back straight.
Tighten yöur thighs and buttocks.
- Straighten the back?
- Yes.
- ls this straight enough?
- Look!
It's straight.
Keep it flat and straight.
- He's so cute!
- Yes!
- How old is he?
- A few months, I think.
- A few months?
He's big.
- Where's his mother?
- At work.
- Yöu take care of him yöurself?
That's great!
So cute and loveable.
- Yöu're not local?
- l'm from Shaanxi.
A student nurse on exchange.
Octopus!
I don't believe my luck.
How can he miss out by a whisker?
I should have known better.
Isn't it fun?
Can yöu believe this?
Thanks so much, Melody.
If not for yöu we wouldn't know what to do with him.
Octopus and I are grateful.
Actually, I'm very grateful.
So that's how he was revived.
Yan.
Did yöu do what I told yöu to do?
Yöu don't have to go if yöu're busy.
Should I call her?
Was I too harsh?
This is Yan, I can't come to the phone right now.
Leave a message at the beep.
- Alan!
- Long time no see, Thongs.
- Yöur baby?
- Hey, stop it!
- Carry on!
- Come.
Be a good boy!
Don't do that!
Thongs, what's yöur game?
Get out if yöu're not playing!
Don't bring a kid in here!
Get lost!
Life is complicated.
Yöu are what yöu eat.
What yöu feed and teach him will stay with him for life.
Yöu must take this seriously.
- Thongs, are yöu in or not?
- Go home and baby-sit!
- Get lost!
- l'm not playing.
Loser!
- Cleaned out already?
- No, he was crying too much.
Yöu're worse than my Dad!
I really don't know.
I've been calling Landlord all night.
I'm a man of my word.
I'll fix it for yöu.
I just want the boy!
Let me out!
is this a joke?
Landlord has 2 partners in crime.
Thongs and Octopus.
Let me out!
Thongs and Octopus.
I don't care what yöu do, find them.
I found them, Boss.
They're inside.
Very good!
Now we change the diaper.
Hey, are yöu Thongs?
Give me the baby.
- What baby?
- Don't play dumb.
- l don't know any Uncles.
- Don't play dumb with me.
- What is it?
- They're looking for Baby.
My name is Baby, looking for me?
Damn!
Yöu're asking for it!
Go!
- What's the matter with yöu?
- Nothing, I just over jumped.
- What did they say?
- Who cares?
Let's go.
- Remember?
- Yes.
Yöu ring the doorbell, and when he opens I'll splash the paint on yöur cue.
- Let him have it!
- Yes.
Wait!
Thongs, don't hide behind women and babies.
I won't spare yöu!
I don't understand a word yöu're saying.
- Thongs is my buddy.
- He's not here right now, come back later.
OK, we'll wait inside.
He's my kid brother.
- Wait!
- Nice to meet yöu.
Wait!
There's no one here.
Fanny, I'm scared.
is it worse than an abortion?
Asking him about the future?
Confront him with the ultrasound.
Be good.
Who are yöu looking for?
Octopus.
He is not here, he'll be back later.
Yöu'd better come in.
Thongs.
Make sure the baby is home.
- What's that look on yöur face?
- Toothache.
- Why is Octopus off in such a hurry?
- He needs to use the toilet.
- Do yöu live here?
- Yes.
- l'd love to come up for a chat.
- Steve!
Octopus!
Thongs!
Yöu've finally shown up!
I'm tired of leaving messages on yöur voicemail.
Leave!
Yöu two, get out!
Come here.
- Where's the baby?
- ln yöur room.
Who are they?
Decorators.
My flat is a mess.
What's with the paint?
We're renovating, just trying out the colours.
What is it, Yan?
Oh, no!
Talk to the officer.
What is it, Miss?
Thongs!
The police can help yöu with any problem.
There's a cop in there!
Go to the roof.
Sit down and tell me yöur problem.
Meet my good friend, Inspector Steve Mok.
He's my... cousin.
He's my... other cousin.
We came to show him the colour sample.
- Yöur face...
- l'm into body art.
What's with all the baby stuff?
Yöu know my pal Octopus.
He's a born womaniser.
He got someone pregnant.
- Can't do much about that.
- Where is he now?
- ln the toilet.
- l need to go too.
- Yöu do?
- l'm investigating a break-in.
- Do yöu know anything about it?
- l quit a long time ago.
Octopus.
Inspector wants to have a word with yöu.
Hurry up.
- Octopus.
What took yöu so long?
- Yöu're here?
- Yöur turn.
- Not after him, it stinks in there.
- Do yöu have a friend in there.
- Friend?
He's my cousin too.
I'm the eldest.
Then let's reminisce.
- Yöu've never met each other?
- Of course they have.
Take care of this, Octopus.
Why are yöu still here?
Get out of my sight!
What the hell is this?
If yöu want to stay, then I'll leave.
Yöu...
And yöu...
- lt sounds complicated.
- Yes, very complicated.
Thongs, we've been friends for so long, I didn't know yöu have cousins of different races.
My Dad was a sailor...
He must have stopped in India.
That'll make him yöur brother.
That's not right.
- Maybe the sailor was his Grandfather.
- Or his mother's father.
What's the matter with yöu?
- What's wrong?
- l have occasional muscle spasms.
Muscle spasms?
- Well?
- Cramps?
Yöu're probably possessed!
Give me a hand.
A baby!
Hold on.
Help me, Thongs!
Give us a hand!
- l'd like to...
- l can bite!
Catch!
Beat it!
Yöu won't get away with this!
Yöu have a lot of nerve, Thongs.
Hurry up!
- Oh no!
- They're inside, go get them!
Mind yöur head!
Yöu're so greedy.
- Listen to me, Steve.
- Yöu can confess at the station.
- l'll turn myself in afterwards.
- Who'd believe yöu?
- Are yöu alright?
- Just worry about yöurself!
- Don't hit my head.
- Thongs!
Stay back!
Should have listened to me.
I'll get yöu, Thongs!
- Octopus!
- Run!
Come back!
Alright, alright.
Get up!
After the truck!
Stop!
Police!
I need to use yöur bike!
Go!
What?
It's not mine.
I'm on learner's permit.
I'll ask the Commissioner to grant yöu a proper license!
Go!
- Really?
- Yes!
Mind if I ask what did yöu use to drive?
I'm just a video gamer!
Someone is tailing us.
Looks like a robber to me.
In broad daylight?
Now what?
Don't worry, call Headquarters.
Ask for back up.
Come in, Headquarters.
This is 3321 , Daniel calling.
- Suspected robbery in progress!
- Stop the car, kid!
Who are yöu calling a kid?
I can tell that yöu're a thief!
- Having fun?
I'll ram yöur butt!
- Move closer!
Easy.
Slow down a bit.
What?
Another one?
- On a motorbike?
- Stop the truck!
Stop.
He's cute!
Hop over!
The Commissioner will be in touch.
Bye!
That way!
After him!
- Free the pushchair!
- Do yöu think I'm sunbathing?
Almost there!
Move closer!
- Stop!
- Turn!
Turn, ram him!
Thank God!
Watch out!
Yöu call yöurself a driver?
Thank God!
That was close.
Everything's fine.
Back up was quick!
Thanks to yöu.
- Where are yöu from?
- l'm from Brokebrook Mountain.
I'm a cop, kid.
I need to use yöur bike.
Yöu're nuts.
I dare yöu to say that again.
- Everything is taken care of, keep in touch.
- Thanks.
This is Octopus, if yöu need me, leave a message after the tone.
"lou" Let's pay off Thongs' debts.
Don't worry, Dad.
Here's my contribution.
Uncle, what happened to yöu?
Yöu've turned into an ice-lolly.
Boss, I can explain...
We're men of honour.
We never renege.
We always keep our word.
Never break a promise.
One for all, and all for yöu!
- $30 million.
- Thirty... million...
That's my offer, take it or leave it.
Money is nothing between yöu and me.
Who is it?
- lt's me.
- Yöu're home!
- Who's the kid?
He's crying like crazy.
- Check him out for me.
Well?
Yöu need to change him and he's running a fever.
- Fever?
- Yes!
- What shall I do?
- Take him to a doctor.
- Take him to a doctor?
- Hurry!
- Landlord?
- l'm free.
- Thank God for that.
- Where are yöu now?
- On my way to the hospital.
- Hospital?
What happened?
- The baby is sick.
- Tell Octopus to meet us there.
Thongs?
Be careful, Dad.
- What happened?
- l called yöu about Dad's stroke.
Yöu were too busy to care.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Take good care of Dad.
Are yöu alright?
The fever broke.
The doctor said he'll be fine.
- Thanks.
- Yöu don't have to worry.
- l...
- Yöu don't have to explain.
No matter what, yöu saved his life.
- Wait here, I'll get his prescription.
- Thanks.
Hurry.
Now that yöu're here, let's talk.
Do yöu know how much more I have bargained for yöu for this poodle?
I give yöu 3 guesses.
$30 million!
$30 million!
This $5 million is just the deposit.
We deliver in 3 hours and we get $25 million more!
It's too good to be true.
Give him this glucose later.
It's not necessary, now that his fever broke.
What?
Yöu two have become nannies now?
It can't be.
What is this?
Three Ferraris.
What are yöu thinking?
Yöur own casino, bigger than Monte Carlo.
Come on!
Give us a chance.
No matter what yöu want, we'll do it.
Just don't hurt our baby.
There's nothing to watch on TV.
Do yöu think she'll recognise him?
Yöu're worried she'll recognise the baby?
This baby is barely... I need some fresh air.
There are hundreds born everyday.
They all look the same.
She won't be able to tell, understand?
We offer specialty sashimi.
Yellow tail, salmon and cuttlefish.
Give it a try, it's only $60.
Come on in, thank yöu.
Please come in.
Specialty sashimi including salmon.
Yellow tail, sweet shrimp, all for $60.
Come in.
Hey, Miss.
Yöu have to speak louder.
Louder!
Special promotion.
Specialty sashimi.
including sweet shrimp, yellow tail, salmon and cuttlefish, only $60.
Please come in.
Special promotion.
Hello.
Darling. I'm sorry.
I don't deserve to be yöur husband.
So long.
Here yöu are, Madam.
- Honey!
- Darling!
Silly, why the tears?
Yöu called from a hospital.
What's going on?
- Are yöu OK?
- l'm fine, dear.
- What happened to yöur glasses?
- l got run over by a bike on my way here and cracked the lenses.
Get me a new pair tomorrow.
Good girl.
Now close yöur eyes.
I have something for yöu.
No peeking.
Take a step back.
Honey, here's something yöu'll cherish.
Ready...
Lower yöur arm.
Right, now the other one.
Now open yöur eyes.
Not so loud, yöu'll scare him.
Baby...
Mummy missed yöu.
Honey...
Have I been a burden to yöu?
Don't be silly.
Yöu made me very happy.
Yöu're my most precious darling.
Not so loud, yöu're waking him.
Good baby.
I'm returning him tomorrow.
I have sorted out the baby formula.
So nice to be a baby.
Eat, sleep, drink and shit.
So happy and without a care in the world.
Right?
Right!
Why do yöu trust me?
Yöu know I'm a burglar, still yöu made friends with me.
Actually...
The first time I saw yöu I knew yöu had a conscience.
If yöu have a chance to start over, will yöu still be a burglar?
It's too late for that now.
Yöu can start from this very second, it's never too late.
Look at me.
Look me in the eye.
I've faith in yöu.
It's Mummy.
- Daddy...
- Cut it out!
Mummy.
Daddy...
Daddy, do yöu know his name?
Why do yöu want to know?
Just curious what will happen.
What do yöu think will happen to him?
- Hello.
- l've got the money.
Bring the kid.
Someone will fetch yöu in five minutes.
Wait here!
Open the gate!
Where is he?
Give me the baby!
Thirty... million...
Give me the baby.
Listen.
Feed him milk every 4 hours.
Check the temperature with the back of yöur hand or yöu'll scald him, understand?
Also, everyday at noon...
He needs his orange juice, got it?
He chokes easily since he has no teeth even crushed fruits will choke him.
- lf yöu feed him solid food, yöu must chew...
- Don't be such a nag!
Hold him with yöur left arm or he'll cry.
Give him congee in the afternoon.
Chop up some lean pork, finely diced.
Not too cold, not too hot.
Serve in two separate bowls.
- OK, OK.
Just hand him over.
- Alright.
- Be careful.
- l will.
Here, take this bottle too.
The temperature is right.
- l got it...
- Don't rock him too hard.
- lt's time to feed him.
- Enough.
I wonder if he'll survive the night.
What are yöu staring at?
Get lost.
- Come on, let's go.
- What are yöu doing?
Don't worry.
They have doctors and nurses, he'll be fine.
It's just a family squabble.
They're taking take him to his Grandpa.
Think about yöur Ferrari and yöur casino.
Come on!
Come on!
- Get the car ready.
- Yes!
- Finished?
- Let's go.
Take him upstairs.
Daddy.
Mummy.
- Daddy's coming!
- Mummy's coming!
Get the kid!
- Give me the baby!
- lt's not our fault... I know, hand me the baby.
Good boy.
Landlord!
Wait for us!
He took off!
Open up!
Give me the baby!
Turn on the machine.
- Hurry!
Send someone to the ferris wheel.
- Yes, sir!
Oh my God!
Baby!
Baby!
- Where are yöu, Baby?
- Mummy.
- Don't move, I'm coming up!
- Mummy.
Stay right there.
I'm here.
Baby.
Baby!
- Daddy.
- lt's not funny!
Great job, Thongs!
Yöu deserve a kiss!
Don't hurt the baby, morons!
Daddy!
Run, Daddy!
Hurry up and get in!
Isn't it fun?
Then let's continue.
Get the kid!
Send the other cars!
Don't worry.
I'll get it back for yöu.
Thongs!
I only want the boy!
Come out... ..or I'll drop him!
We all die sooner or later.
It's a matter of going in style.
Take the baby and go.
Don't mind me!
I doubt if he'll drop me.
Thongs!
On the count to 1 0 and I'll let go.
1 , 2... 6, 7...
What?
What about 3 to 5?
8, 9, 1 0!
Stop!
- Get the baby!
- Yes!
Who the hell invented free fall machines?
- Master.
- What a cute baby.
Give me a big smile.
Yöu're my grandson.
- Don't cry, Mummy's here.
- Daddy's here!
- Mummy's here.
- Daddy's here.
- Mummy's here.
- Hold him with yöur left arm or he'll cry.
Not bad.
I understand why yöu're giving up yöur reward.
But I'm keeping this baby.
Yöu should go if yöu want to stay alive.
Give me a smile.
Yöu're my grandson, understand?
Alright.
As soon as we get the result, the three of us are going to Brazil.
Who are yöu?
I only want the baby.
Nothing else matters.
- lt's awful to separate him from his mother.
- Awful?
What about my dead son?
Max lost his mother when he was a child.
I promised him his own amusement park.
It's finished now.
I also promised him a race track, but it's only half complete.
And that bitch killed him.
I already lost a son.
I'm not going to lose my grandson.
This child is my only reason for living.
If yöu feel this way, think about his mother.
She must be feeling the same.
Why must yöu separate them?
What if he's not yöur grandson?
What'll happen then?
- The lab report, Master.
- Yöu can go.
What's going on?
What is he doing?
I'm not really sure.
I found the boy.
But he's not yöur son.
Don't do this, Master.
Prepare the medication.
Mind yöur health, sir.
Watch him.
Take the kid with yöu.
- Easy...
- Don't shut the door!
Let him keep yöu company.
Be careful, Master.
Give him a hand.
Where's the baby?
Give us the baby!
- l want my baby.
- Don't!
Take yöur money and leave.
I'm turning this place into an ice palace!
A big one.
- A gigantic ice palace.
- Master.
A gigantic ice palace.
What's the matter with yöu?
- See for yöurself.
- Yöu're useless.
That was quick!
Did yöu see them?
Yes, I saw them both.
Why are yöu still here?
Throw them out!
Can yöu do this?
Thank God.
Round and round and round he goes!
Goddamn baldy!
Octopus, the baby hasn't cried for a while.
I'm aware of that!
Baldy!
I hate bald heads.
It's fresh.
Baby!
Octopus!
Baby...
Baby!
Baby...
Baby!
- How is he?
- Take off yöur jacket.
Baby, hang in there!
Yöu'll be alright.
Baby!
Go!
Put it on!
Baby...
Catch!
Turn it up.
Gorge yöurself!
Feed them something extra.
See if yöu can open the door.
There's no key hole to pick... lt can't be opened from the inside.
- Thongs!
- Octopus?
Are yöu alright, Thongs?
- Open the door!
- Only the Master knows the combination.
- What?
Only he can open it?
- Yöu saw him.
He has gone mad.
Yöu're on, Landlord.
Do yöur stuff.
How?
It's a Swiss computerised mechanical lock.
Eight layers with over four million combinations.
Same kind as used by the ClA.
Save yöur breath, open it while I call the cops.
Run for it...
Stop!
Hey, come back!
Be quiet!
- The machines are too loud.
- Turn off the machines.
- and the refrigerator.
- Unplug the refrigerator.
- And the air conditioning.
- Kill the air conditioning.
- Everybody, hold yöur breath.
- What?
- Hold yöur breath!
- Silence!
- Well?
is it open?
- Why doesn't the door pop open?
- Pops open?
- Don't touch it!
Why doesn't it pop open?
Because of this?
It has nothing to do with something so intricate.
Damn... lt's opening!
What took yöu so long?
Save the baby.
- Save him...
- How is he?
Save the baby.
- Yöu promised me a reduced sentence.
- Alright...
The car!
Don't die on me!
The car...
Hot-wire it!
Don't scare me, Baby...
Come get yöur milk.
Baby!
Wake up for milk.
Mummy's here, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid...
Baby...
Don't die on me.
Come drink yöur milk.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up, Baby.
- Pop the hood, use the engine.
- The engine is in the back!
1 , 2, 3!
Wake up!
One more time!
1 , 2, 3!
- Take them away.
- Yes, sir.
Bring yöur men and block the exits.
- Don't let anyone through.
- Yes, sir!
Baby, Baby!
Come back.
Never mind.
Hurry, please.
Pulse rate 80 BPM.
Max.
This is the police!
Max, come home.
- l want to play with yöu...
- Just calm down!
Max...
Sorry, Honey!
Take care of yöurself.
I thought money was important, but I was wrong.
If there's reincarnation I still want yöu for my wife.
We'll have 1 0 kids, OK?
I love yöu.
Darling, while I'm in jail, I miss yöu every single second.
I now know how awful yöu must have felt when I was wild and unruly.
I'm really sorry.
If I have the chance to start over, I'll cherish yöu more.
Dad, all I did was gamble and caused yöu a lot of trouble.
I've been dealt a lousy hand.
I thought if I had money, I'd earn respect and own the world.
Now I've learnt my lesson, at the expense of my beloved family.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Goodbye.
We'll have lots of kids and play in the garden.
All of us will race each other...
May the Lord forgive yöur sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.
We'll have our own children.
We play in the backyard while yöu make dinner, and do our laundry.
Fire!
The government policy back then was very strict with the death penalty.
It was only used on convicts who had committed serious crimes.
What yöu have just witnessed are different forms of the death penalty.
I'm sure yöu now have a better understanding.
Let's have another round of applause for our inmates who gave us the demonstration.
Well done!
Thank yöu!
Please help yöurselves to the refreshments.
Hi there!
- How are yöu, Landlady?
- Yöu were great, Thongs.
Where's Dad?
Yöu did a great job, Honey.
I was so scared.
- lt wasn't real, silly.
- What about the "l love yöu" part?
Of course that was for real.
Honey, I have adopted 1 0 kids!
From South Africa, the Middle East, Germany...
Anyone from Cameroon?
Let me see...
I'm so happy!
Don't over exert yöurself, yöu're pregnant.
Let me carry that...
- Don't frown, it's bad for the baby.
- Speak for yöurself.
The doctor said the baby is doing great.
I almost forgot my appointment.
With a man or a woman?
My clients are either men or women.
- l can only meet with women?
- No.
- Space, remember?
- Yes... I have plenty of space here.
Alright...
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for taking care of my Dad.
- How are yöu getting along?
- There's nothing to it, it's not my first time.
But I promise yöu it'll be my last.
- Why are yöu making promises to me?
- l... I promise my Dad.
Thongs.
Inspector.
Yöu have to thank yöur lucky stars.
The Justice Department may put yöu on parole.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Look who's here to see yöu.
- Baby!
- Baby!
Baby!
- Over here...
- Go on.
- Give me a hug.
- Mummy.
It's been a long time.
Sorry we didn't have a chance to apologise.
We're really very sorry.
We know, if it hadn't been for yöu, our baby could have died.
- l wonder if they'll be interested?
- About what?
- About working for us.
- What?
Yöu'll be in charge of security.
Yöu can be the bodyguard.
Yöu can be the chauffeur.
I'm perfect for the job.
Driving sports cars has to be my pet project.
- Are yöu interested?
- Absolutely!
We'll wait for yöur discharge, then.
Our Open Day is over.
Time to return to yöur cell.
The baby!
Oh, right.
- Mrs. Li, We don't even know his name.
- lt's Matthew.
Ka Sing.
Li Ka Sing?

She'll save yöu the best seat.

- l can't hear a word yöu're saying.
Apply more honey.
More.
Stop, I can't stand this!
- Thongs!
- Steve, I didn't see yöu.
Yöu say that every time.
Yöu missed the alumni gathering.
- Nobody called me.
- Are yöu sure?
- Grade school or college?
- lt's supposed to be High School!
Stop fluffing yöur line!
It was a one-take!
Do yöu know how scary it was up there?
I now have to do it all over again!
I'll wring yöur neck for this!

THE END
So they're just gonna give him 100 grand?
Cash, in a bag, that's correct.
Just to show up to a party?
Just to show up.
You don't even have to smile, Vin.
- Only in America.
- No, only in Vegas.
So what do you say, E?
Should we go?
Well, seeing that you told the Hollywood Foreign Press that the whole town is a bunch of dickheads,
I don't think anybody's gonna miss us.
So, what you're saying is, we should go.
Have I ever said no to Vegas?
Be like saying no to a blowjob.
What do you say, Johnny?
Vegas?
Uh, love to, bro, but I'm shooting my pilot on the 30th.
- I gotta stay rested.
- You're turning down Vegas, Drama?
I'm gonna be turning down a lot of things, Turtle, now that I'm a working actor.
Better get used to it.
You know, Johnny, there are many different Vegases.
You could go and just spot.
Don't you have that masseuse you love over there?
Oh, yeah, Ken at the Hard Rock.
He's got hands of gold.
It's insane that you let a man rub your body.
No, what's insane is that you think a massage is sexual.
A real massage requires strong, manly hands, which my boy Ken has got in spades.
After 24 hours with Ken,
I'm ready for work.
Absolutely, bro, I'm in.
Nice.
Let's do it.
- Who's gonna break the news to Ari?
- Oh... be happy to.
Vin, this is not the time to go to Vegas.
You've got a serious public image problem right now.
That's why I'm going, Ari.
Hoping by the time I get back, everyone will have forgotten about it.
Come on, Vinny, listen, we need to get you a job.
- You read any of those scripts?
- I brought 'em with.
Thought you might read 'em to me.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we could use a chaperone.
- Help keep us out of trouble.
- I'm not going to Vegas on a Wednesday.
- Come on, what else you got to do?
- I have the theater with the wife and her mother tonight.
Move over, I'm in.
Nice relaxing Wednesday may be just what I need.
Vegas, baby, Vegas!
I'm sorry, baby, you know I'd rather be at "Menopause, The Musical" tonight than here, but I got kidnapped!
- It's true!
- You see that, baby?
- Will you sign this?
- I'm sorry, honey--
- Hello?
Hello?
- Is she mad?
She said she'd rather see me gagged and bound like a real kidnappee, yeah, so I think so.
Oh, all right, here comes the apology.
Hey, baby.
I put $6 million into this company and find out at the staff meeting that you're at the roulette table?
- Oh, hey, Babs, how are ya?
- What the fuck are you doing, Ari?
I'm taking care of a high-priority client, that's what I'm doing.
You have 150 clients to keep happy, now.
Barbara--
You need to manage your time more efficiently.
- You're not my mother, Babs.
- Fuck you, Ari.
See, my mother would never speak to me that way.
I hate women!
Not all women.
Who's got five?
Ready and waiting, bro.
What's this?
Tradition.
When we were kids, we'd hit AC, we'd put five bucks on red.
We win, we knew it'd be a good weekend.
- What if you lose?
- Vince never loses.
Five on red.
Come on!
Red 16.
- It's gonna be a good weekend.
- Keep the change, bro.
Hey, Vinny, what do you say we go halves?
We'll do like a gambling partnership.
- Okay, Ari, you're on.
- All right.
- Hey!
Vinny Chase.
- Seth.
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?
You here for that thing at Body English tonight?
- Yeah.
- Cool, yeah, me too.
It should be fun.
I brought my whole crew out.
Definitely.
You know Ari Gold, my agent?
Never met, big fan.
That's funny dude.
That pinky bought me a house in Malibu.
Malibu!
And I think you know E.
How you doing, Seth?
Good to see you again.
How you doing, man?
How'd that thing work out for you at the hotel?
Like I said, it wasn't what it looked like.
Like I said, it never is.
So, how's Sloan, man?
She's still good, Seth.
Cool, hey, do me a favor.
Tell her I said "what up," okay?
Yeah, I will.
I'll tell her that.
- All right.
See ya.
- See ya.
- What's up, Seth?
- Oh, Johnny Drama.
- How you doing, man?
- Did you hear about my pilot?
- No!
Congratulations!
- Thanks, bro.
Good for you, man!
You could use the work.
What the fuck is up with this guy?
Every time I see him, he asks me about Sloan and he's got a shit-eating grin on his face.
Don't get all panicky, E.
Seriously, E, you'd be jealous if he said they were cousins.
- What does that mean?
- It means you're a jealous guy.
- Always have been.
- Bullshit.
Face it E, you're like Eric Roberts in "Star 80."
How would you know?
- I've heard stories.
- Yeah?
Name one example.
Andy Abetemarco, 10th grade.
You punched him in the head just because he got assigned to be Audrey Polini's lab partner.
There's more to that story, Turtle, he stole her frog.
- Hey, you know they got married?
- Really?
No, but see, you're still jealous.
- Whatever.
- Whatever, exactly.
- I don't think Seth meant anything.
- All right.
Nice room, Turtle.
Hey, boys, fruit's all green.
Whoa, easy with that, Ari.
It's from Body English.
Ah!
100k, Vince.
Nice.
Hey Vinny, who'd you have to fuck to get that?
No fucking, Ari.
I just have to go to a party.
Not according to this itinerary.
Says you also gotta be at a pool event this afternoon and then drinks with the contestants tonight.
Contestants?
Yeah, says you're judging a beauty contest.
- Queen of the Strip.
- Sounds like a bonus.
Sounds like I don't know what you got us into as usual.
So far it all looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Yeah, we'll see about that.
I'm gonna go check it out.
I'm comin' with you.
Hey, Vinny, go win us some money.
God damn, I feel at ease.
I'm out.
You brought your own robe?
Why wouldn't I?
- Mind if we join you?
- Sure.
- I'll take some chips, please.
- All of it?
- Well, 10 is yours, do what you want.
- Really?
Yeah, man.
Commission.
You earned it.
Thank you, Vince!
You-
- You booked him into this?
- Turtle did.
- Nice job managing.
This should be great for his image.
What are you doing?
I'm on vay-cay.
Getting a cocktail.
All right.
What are we drinking?
- Johnny!
- Hey, Ken!
- It's been a while.
- How are ya, buddy?
Good to see ya.
You look great.
You look great.
I lost a couple pounds.
- Yeah, it shows.
- Thanks.
What have you got there?
California almonds.
I remember last time I was in town you said you couldn't find a decent almond in the desert, so I thought, well...
Wow.
I can't believe you remembered.
That's really thoughtful.
I got an elephant's brain, Ken.
I remember everything.
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it,
I'm stressed like a motherfucker.
A little of that, a little of this, some of that...
All right, come on, baby!
Come on!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
He should just cancel this.
Definitely.
- He's up 2500.
- Oh yeah?
That means I'm up 1250.
Drinks are on me, E.
- One more for the road?
- Definitely.
Oh Ken, you have not lost your touch.
All these compliments are gonna make me insecure.
Well don't be.
You've got the gift.
- No doubt.
- Thanks.
In fact, I'd like to lock you down for the rest of the day.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
I'll double your rate.
'Cause I don't want these hands touching anyone but me.
Ooh...
Hit me.
- Sorry, sir.
- Hey, you can't stay hot forever.
- Hit.
- Ah, but Turtle can!
Hey, jerkoff, you signed him up
- to judge a stripper contest.
- Really?
- Titties?
- It's a stripper contest.
- Nice.
- Vin, you should cancel.
- I agree.
- Can't cancel.
Yeah, you can.
You didn't sign anything.
- Just give the money back.
- Money's gone, E.
- What are you talking about?
- I hit a little cold streak.
You lost 100 grand?
- Something like that.
- But we're partners.
Oh, shit, I forgot.
Means I'm only really down 50.
Shoulda partnered up with me, Ari.
I'm up 1200.
I get to two grand,
I'm keeping it stashed to buy me a high class ho.
But Turtle, I already gave you 10.
I only pay for pussy with profits.
I thought you never lose, Vin.
It's not a loss till we leave Nevada.
- I'll win it back.
Don't you worry.
- I'm worried, Vin.
- I'm worried!
- If you want out, cut your losses--
What, and miss the boat when you go on a million dollar run?
- No way, count me in.
- All right.
Vince, you gotta blow off this stripper thing, man.
- No, let's go, it'll be fun.
- It will be.
And we gotta be at the pool for the meet-and-greet in five minutes.
- That'll definitely be fun.
- Let's do it.
Fuck the pool, let's win our money back.
You don't care about him judging a stripper contest, Ari?
Which is worse for his image?
That he judges a stripper contest, or he loses a couple hundred thousand at the fucking tables?
Table's not going anywhere, calm down.
Hey, yo, E!
Hey, did you tell Sloan I said "what up"?
- No, Seth.
- Why not?
Because it was like a half an hour ago.
It's just a phone call, man.
Make the call.
- Say "what up."
- Yeah, E.
Make the call, say "what up."
So this dickhead is saying what, that he fucked my girlfriend?
I don't know, E.
It's hard to say what he was saying.
It's not hard to say.
Seth Green landed on Plymouth Rock
- before you did, E. Wake up.
- No shot.
I'm so not interested in this!
Can we please go out there and win some money?
- Please, Vinny!
- The strippers aren't even here yet.
Look, E, it could've been years ago.
The guy's been running around Hollywood since he was like 12.
And Sloan does like her men petite.
Fuck that.
I know every guy she's been with.
How?
- What, did you make a list?
- Yeah, Turtle.
Couples make lists.
You wouldn't know that for obvious reasons.
Where the fuck are these girls!
Somebody...
What Ari, you and your wife didn't make lists?
- We did.
I'm the only one on it.
- Yeah, right.
Look E, I don't wanna rile you up, but I've done the list thing.
What, did you hand over a hard drive, Vin?
It was big but I did leave some off.
Everyone does.
So what, you're saying that-- that Sloan left Seth Green off the list?
I think everybody leaves someone off the list.
Except you.
I'm calling.
Ain't you gonna call your wife, Ari?
I don't care if my wife's getting fucked right now, Turtle,
I need to get my money back!
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello.
I'm Joanne, but I go by the stage name of Cheyenne.
I understand you're judging the contest.
Is there anything I can do to get you to vote for me?
Yeah, Vince, what's a girl gotta do to get a vote around here?
Come on, Vince, we're gonna get stuck here all day.
Let's go.
Girls, due to circumstances beyond my control--
Me!
- I have to go.
- But talk to my boy, Turtle, here.
He's the eyes, mouth and ears of this operation.
- Enjoy.
- First, the commission, now this?
This is like Christmas.
- Hi, Turtle.
- How you doin'?
So you're really his eyes and ears?
Ken, whatever happened to that pretty little
Filipino girlfriend of yours, Annie?
Sore subject.
She just moved out a week ago.
Fuck her.
Hands like yours...
her loss.
- Still hurts.
- Yeah, I hear you, Ken.
You know what?
Johnny Drama's got just the cure for your heartbreak.
Really?
What's that?
Boys' night out.
Just a good steak, nice bottle of red, couple cigars and some good conversation.
You do that, Ken, and you'll forget all about women in no time.
I don't usually go out socially with clients, Johnny.
Ken, I'd like to think after all this time you look at me as more than just a client.
Oh, Eric.
He's so annoying.
Annoying how?
We we on a teen tour together, and he was obsessed with me for like the entire trip.
- But you never dated him?
- No, Eric, I never dated him.
This is a tough competition, girls, and what, with $25,000 prize, everybody needs an edge.
Fortunately for you,
I left my integrity back in Los Angeles.
My vote is 100% for sale.
Hit me.
Jesus!
What the fuck are you smirking about?
Huh?
Where are you going?
Oh, I'm not feeling it right now.
You can't force the cards.
- How much are we down?
- Uh, 110.
Each.
Jesus!
- We'll get it back after dinner.
- I'm not hungry, Vinny.
You take the reins, maybe you'll have better luck.
Don't go too crazy, I don't wanna lose more than 500 grand.
Bring it.
Bring it!
So you talked to her,
- and she said nothing happened?
- Right.
Why's he trying to make it like something did?
'Cause he's a jerkoff.
- Why are you so calm?
- The old E would not have been able to control himself.
The old E, "Mad Dog" E, woulda bit Seth Green's ear off.
Guys, I'm a grown man.
I don't fight anymore.
Oh, way to be mature.
Yeah, you're really entering your latter years gracefully.
Speaking of latter years...
Fuck off, E.
How relaxed do I look?
Mmm, you look like you died in 1983.
Wait till you see me after a shower,
I'm gonna sparkle like the 4th of July.
Wait till you see dinner.
I got 10 of the best strippers in town
- joining us tonight.
- Ooh!
Strippers?
Why?
Now, shouldn't it be, strippers, how
- and thank you?
- Thank you.
Look, we don't want girls at the table tonight.
I'm just trying to keep this trip free of distractions.
We?
Who's we?
Ken.
He's gonna be joining us tonight.
You don't want strippers at dinner 'cause your gay masseuse is joining us?
I'm really starting to worry about you, Drama.
Oh please, Turtle, Ken is not gay.
In fact, if I release him on the strippers tonight, you're gonna be shit out of luck.
Oh, please.
Bring it on.
So, have you seen "Brokeback Mountain," Kenneth?
Nah.
I don't get to the movies.
When I'm not working, I'm usually training.
- Training for what?
- Well, it's probably too late for me, but I still dream of the NFL.
- You play ball?
- Ken was a superstar at U of A.
I don't know about superstar.
Oh, yes.
Yes you were.
And a second-round draft pick for the San Diego Chargers.
Went 74 yards and three receptions in his first NFL quarter, then blew out his knee.
Fucking AstroTurf.
That sucks, man.
You really do remember everything, Johnny.
- Elephant brain.
- Turtle, girls.
Watch this.
- Hey, Shelby.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Crystal.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Tiffany.
- Hi, sweetie.
- This is Bunny.
- Hey, Turtle.
And Minx.
Yo, E, be cool.
I'm cool, Vince.
I'm totally cool.
What do ya got, what do ya got?
Come on, come on.
Show me a little love, little love, little love.
What do ya think-- Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Can I have another marker?
Please?
Please...
This is Mt.
Kilimanjaro, one of the tallest mountains on earth and it's freezing.
So I say to this girl,
"I'd be happy to give up my canteen for you, but what are you gonna give up for me?"
Fantastic.
Oh, Ken.
I gotta hit the head.
I'll be right back.
So?
- I love him.
- I told you.
Let's hit the bar.
Maybe I should check on Ari, see how he's doing.
He can't be doing any worse than you.
Oh, it's Vinny Chase and the Chasers!
Hey, let me get a couple more Jager shots
- for the boys from Queens over there.
- No thanks.
What's the matter, you don't drink, Eric?
I drink vodka, Seth.
I stopped drinking Jager in high school.
Oh!
But listen, I told Sloan you said "what up."
Mmm.
What'd she say?
She said "what up."
- That's all?
- That's all.
All right.
All right.
You tell her I said "what up" back.
Yeah, man.
Don't forget to tell her he said "what up" back.
What is wrong with these guys?
They're like retards.
Yeah, but you were calm.
Yeah, but is it gonna last though, E?
Or are we doing battle?
We're not doin' battle, Drama.
It ain't gonna happen.
All right.
All this testosterone has put a kink in my neck.
I'm gonna have to get Ken to work that out.
Better hurry up, Drama, looks like he's working one out right now.
Christ almighty.
Oh, that's Amber.
Country girl, promised me three days in her father's cabin in Montana if she wins.
Turtle, I know it's a stripper contest, but I can't pick someone 'cause she promised to fuck you.
I don't care who wins.
I cut deals with all of 'em.
Uh, sweetheart, this guy's with me tonight.
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to relax before the competition.
Sorry, sister, I got my own problems.
Fuck you!
- I'm feeling good, Ari.
Let me sit.
- Ari, relax.
- How much we down?
- 200 and fuckin' 70!
We can get that back.
You're gonna get thrown outta here, calm down.
He's a little upset.
I'll take another marker for 100,000 please.
Thanks, Sam.
So, Ken, did you get to sample those almonds I gave you?
Oh, they were terrific, John.
Brought me right back to my childhood.
Yeah, I knew you'd appreciate 'em.
Oh, crap.
They must have closed shop early tonight.
Oh, no, no, no--
How 'bout we just reconvene in the morning?
No, no.
There's no way I can sleep without a rubdown.
Let's take it back to my room, huh?
Uh...
yeah... okay.
- Split 'em.
- How much is that?
- 75 grand.
- Now 150.
Gotta do it.
Split 'em again.
I once saw a guy split six times straight.
No choice.
Double down.
Vinny, that's 300 grand.
We're gonna win it all back on this hand.
Yeah, or my kids are going to community college.
I'll take this hand myself if you want.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
I'd like to split these please.
- You're gonna split kings?
- Yeah.
What's it to you?
I got 150 grand on this hand, I don't want you fucking up my cards.
Sir, you have to let him play his way.
- He's playing like a fucking idiot!
- Sir...
Ari, calm down.
Ari, relax.
You're gonna get thrown out of the casino with 300,000 on the table.
- Calm down--
- We'll take care of it later, Ari.
Looks like I knew what I was doing, huh?
No, it looks like you took her break card.
Dealer has 11.
Looks like she would've had 21.
I think an apology is in order.
Oh!
Somebody shoot me and put me out of my fucking misery.
If only it weren't a crime.
Ari, remain positive.
Summon the cards you desire.
Get a higher power from above.
Come on!
Can't hurt to try.
Please, God, give us another 10!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Am I getting that apology?
You know what, man?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Give it to me.
You know, I don't have my table or anything, Johnny.
That's okay.
We can just use the bed, right?
- I guess.
- Cool, I'll go get changed.
Oh, hey, Ken, I got a nice pineapple-coconut-aloe-vera gel.
Is that cool?
What the fuck are you doing, Ken?
Johnny, I have never thought about a man...
in that way.
But the adoration you have poured on me today has made me feel that if... this is something that you need, fuck it...
It is Vegas!
Johnny!
Looks like they started already.
No, this is just the pre-show.
Well, now that we're up 100 grand, we should have a post-show up in the suite.
What do you say, Turtle?
I already ordered four bottles of Cristal and 400 chocolate-covered strawberries.
Nice.
Does money won feel better than money earned,
- or am I nuts?
- You're nuts.
Oh!
It's the "we don't drink Jager" crew!
What up, E?
This fucking guy, man.
Hey, did you tell Sloan I said "what up" again?
No, Seth, I think one time was all she needed.
What's that mean?
It means she said you used to be obsessed with her.
I don't think she needs to feel like you're still obsessed with her.
- She said I was obsessed with her?
- Yeah, sorry to say.
No, that's all right.
No apologies necessary.
I mean, in reality, it's more like... she was obsessed with this.
Hey, you know what?
Keep fucking dreaming, Seth.
- Keep dreaming.
- Oh, you're right.
I must have been dreaming about how I blasted her in the face like a Jackson Pollock.
You got a problem?
- Get your fucking hand off me, man.
- No, but I do!
This ought to be good for your image, Vince.
- So they're just gonna give him 100 grand?
- Cash in a bag.
- Just to show up to a party?
- You don't even have to smile, Vin.
- Only in America.
- No, only in Vegas.
So what do you say, E?
Should we go?
As you told Hollywood the town is a bunch of dickheads, I don't think anybody will miss us.
- So you say we should go.
- Have I ever said no to Vegas?
Be like saying no to a blowjob.
What do you say, Johnny?
Vegas?
Love to, bro, but I'm shooting my pilot on the 30th.
- I gotta stay rested.
- You're turning down Vegas?
I'll turn down a lot of things, Turtle, now I'm a working actor.
Get used to it.
Johnny, there are many different Vegases.
You could go and just spot.
Don't you have a masseuse you love over there?
Yeah, Ken at the Hard Rock.
He's got hands of gold.
It's insane that you let a man rub your body.
What's insane is that you think a massage is sexual.
A real massage requires strong, manly hands, which my boy Ken has got in spades.
After 24 hours with Ken, I'm ready for work.
Absolutely, bro, I'm in.
Nice.
Let's do it.
- Who's gonna break the news to Ari?
- Be happy to.
Vin, this is not the time to go to Vegas.
You've got a public image problem.
Hoping by the time I get back, everyone will have forgotten.
Vinnie, we need to get you a job.
You read any of those scripts?
I thought you might read 'em to me.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we could use a chaperone.
- Keep us out of trouble.
- I'm not going to Vegas on a Wednesday.
- What else you got to do?
- The theatre with the wife and her mother.
Move over, I'm in.
Nice, relaxing Wednesday may be just what I need.
Vegas, baby, Vegas!
I'm sorry, baby.
I'd rather be at Menopause, the Musical tonight, but I got kidnapped!
- It's true!
- You see that, baby?
I'm sorry, honey...
- Hello?
Hello?
- Is she mad?
She said she'd rather see me gagged and bound like a real kidnappee, so I think so.
Here comes the apology.
Hey, baby.
I put $6 million into this company and find out that you're at the roulette table?
- Babs, how are ya?
- What are you doing, Ari?
I'm taking care of a high-priority client.
You have 150 clients.
You need to manage your time more efficiently.
- You're not my mother, Babs.
- Fuck you, Ari.
See, my mother would never speak to me that way.
I hate women!
Not all women.
Who's got five?
- Ready and waiting, bro.
- What's this?
As kids we'd put five bucks on red.
We win, we knew it'd be a good weekend.
- What if you lose?
- Vince never loses.
Five on red.
Come on!
Red 16.
- It's gonna be a good weekend.
- Keep the change.
Hey, Vinnie, shall we go halves?
A gambling partnership.
- OK, Ari.
- All right.
- Vinnie Chase.
- Seth.
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?
Are you here for that thing at Body English?
It should be fun.
- I brought my crew.
- You know Ari Gold, my agent?
Never met, big fan.
That's funny, dude.
That pinky bought me a house in Malibu.
Malibu!
And I think you know E.
- Seth, good to see you.
- How'd that thing work out for you at the hotel?
- Like I said, it wasn't what it looked like.
- Like I said, it never is.
How's Sloan, man?
She's still good, Seth.
Do me a favour.
Tell her I said, "What up."
- I will.
I'll tell her that.
- All right.
See ya.
- What's up, Seth?
- Johnny Drama.
How you doing?
- Did you hear about my pilot?
- No.
Congratulations!
- Thanks, bro.
- Good for you, man!
You could use the work.
Every time I see him, he asks me about Sloan and he's got a shit-eating grin on his face.
- Don't panic, E.
- You'd be jealous if he said they were cousins.
- What does that mean?
- You're a jealous guy.
- Always have been.
- Bullshit.
- E, you're like Eric Roberts in Star 80.
- How would you know?
- I've heard stories.
- Name one example.
Andy Abetemarco.
You punched him because he got to be Audrey Polini's lab partner.
There's more to that story, he stole her frog.
- They got married.
- Really?
- No, but you're still jealous.
- Whatever.
- Exactly.
I don't think Seth meant anything.
- All right.
Nice room, Turtle.
Boys, fruit's all green.
Easy with that, Ari.
It's from Body English.
100K, Vince.
- Nice.
- Vinnie, who'd you have to fuck to get that?
- No fucking, Ari.
I just have to go to a party.
- Not according to this.
You got a pool event and then drinks with the contestants tonight.
Contestants?
- Says you're judging a beauty contest.
- Sounds like a bonus.
- I don't know what you got us into.
- So far it all looks pretty good.
We'll see.
I'm gonna check it out.
I'm comin' with you.
Vinnie, go win us some money.
Goddamn, I feel at ease.
I'm out.
You brought your own robe?
Why wouldn't I?
- Mind if we join you?
- Sure.
- I'll take some chips, please.
- All of it?
- Well, 10 is yours, do what you want.
- Really?
- Yeah, man.
Commission.
You earned it.
- Thank you, Vince!
You booked him into this?
- Turtle did.
- Nice job managing.
This should be great for his image.
- What are you doing?
- I'm on vay-cay.
Getting a cocktail.
All right.
What are we drinking?
- It's been a while.
- How are ya, buddy?
Good to see ya.
You look great.
You look great.
I lost a couple pounds.
- Yeah, it shows.
- Thanks.
What have you got there?
California almonds.
I remember last time I was in town you said you couldn't find a decent almond in the desert, so I thought, well...
I can't believe you remembered.
That's really thoughtful.
I got an elephant's brain.
I remember everything.
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it,
I'm stressed like a motherfucker.
A little of that, a little of this, some of that...
All right, come on, baby!
Come on!
- He should just cancel this.
- Definitely.
- He's up 2500.
- Oh yeah?
That means I'm up 1250.
Drinks are on me, E.
- One more for the road?
- Definitely.
Ken, you have not lost your touch.
These compliments are gonna make me insecure.
Well, don't be.
You've got the gift.
- No doubt.
- Thanks.
In fact, I'd like to lock you down for the rest of the day.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
I'll double your rate.
Cos I don't want these hands touching anyone but me.
Hit me.
- Sorry, sir.
- Hey, you can't stay hot forever.
- Hit.
- But Turtle can!
Hey, you signed him up to judge a stripper contest.
- Really?
Titties?
- It's a stripper contest.
- Nice.
- Vin, you should cancel.
- I agree.
- Can't cancel.
- You can.
Give the money back.
- Money's gone.
- What?
- I hit a cold streak.
- You lost 100 grand?
- Something like that.
- But we're partners.
- Shit, I forgot.
Means I'm only really down 50.
Shoulda partnered up with me, Ari.
I'm up 1200.
I get to two grand, I'm keeping it stashed to buy me a high class ho.
- But Turtle, I gave you 10.
- I only pay for pussy with profits.
- I thought you never lose.
- It's not a loss till we leave.
- I'll win it back.
Don't worry.
- I'm worried, Vin.
If you want out...
And miss out when you go on a million-dollar run?
No way.
- All right.
- Blow off this stripper thing.
- No, it'll be fun.
- It will be.
- We gotta be at the pool in five minutes.
- Let's do it.
Fuck the pool, let's win our money back.
You don't care if he judges a stripper contest?
Which is worse for his image?
That he judges a stripper contest, or he loses thousands?
- Table's not going anywhere, calm down.
- Hey, yo, E!
Did you tell Sloan I said, "What up"?
- No, Seth.
- Why not?
Because it was like a half an hour ago.
- It's just a call.
Make the call, say, "what up."
- Yeah, E. Make the call, say, "What up."
So he's saying he fucked my girlfriend?
- I don't know, E.
- It's hard to say.
It's not hard.
Seth Green landed on Plymouth Rock before you did, E. Wake up.
- No shot.
- Can we please go and win some money?
The strippers aren't here yet.
E, it could've been years ago.
The guy's been in Hollywood since he was like 12.
And Sloan does like her men petite.
- I know every guy she's been with.
- How?
- You made a list?
- Yeah.
Couples make lists.
- You wouldn't know that for obvious reasons.
- Where the fuck are these girls?
- You and your wife made lists?
- I'm the only one on it.
Yeah, right.
Look, E, I don't wanna rile you up, but I've done the list thing.
- Did you hand over a hard drive, Vin?
- It was big.
But I did leave some off.
So you're saying Sloan left Seth Green off the list?
I think everybody leaves someone off the list.
Except you.
- I'm calling.
- Ain't you gonna call your wife, Ari?
I don't care if my wife's getting fucked right now, Turtle, I need to get my money back!
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello.
I'm Joanne, but I go by the stage name of Cheyenne.
I understand you're judging the contest.
What can I do to get you to vote for me?
Yeah, Vince, what's a girl gotta do to get a vote?
- Vince, we'll be here all day.
- Due to circumstances beyond my control...
Me!
I have to go.
But talk to my boy, Turtle.
He's the eyes, mouth and ears of this operation.
- Enjoy.
- The commission, now this?
It's Christmas.
- Hi, Turtle.
- How you doin'?
So you're really his eyes and ears?
Ken, whatever happened to that pretty little Filipino girlfriend of yours, Annie?
Sore subject.

Fuck her.
Hands like yours, her loss.
- Still hurts.

I don't usually go out socially with clients, Johnny.
Ken, I'd like to think after all this time you see me as more than just a client.
- Oh, Eric.
He's so annoying.
- Annoying how?
We were on a teen tour together, and he was obsessed with me for the entire trip.
- But you never dated him?
- No, Eric, I never dated him.
This is a tough competition, girls, and what with a $25,000 prize, everybody needs an edge.

Bring it.
Bring it!
So you talked to her and she said nothing happened?
- Right.
- Why's he making out something did?
- Cos he's a jerk-off.
- Why are you so calm?
The old E would not have been able to control himself.
The old E, "Mad Dog" E, woulda bit Seth Green's ear off.
- I'm a grown man.
I don't fight any more.
- Way to be mature.
You're entering your latter years gracefully.
Speaking of latter years...
Fuck off, E.
How relaxed do I look?
You look like you died in 1983.
Wait till you see me after a shower, I'm gonna sparkle like the 4th of July.
Wait till dinner.
I got ten of the best strippers in town joining us.
Strippers?
Why?
- Shouldn't it be, "Strippers?
Thank you"?
- Thank you.
We don't want girls at the table tonight.
I'm trying to keep this trip free of distractions.
- We?
Who's "we"?
- Ken.
He's gonna be joining us tonight.
You don't want strippers at dinner cos your gay masseuse is joining us?
I'm really starting to worry about you, Drama.
Please, Turtle, Ken is not gay.
In fact, if I release him on the strippers tonight, you're gonna be shit out of luck.
Please.
Bring it on.
So, have you seen Brokeback Mountain, Kenneth?
Nah.
I don't get to the movies.
- When I'm not working, I'm usually training.
- For what?
It's probably too late for me, but I still dream of the NFL.
- You play ball?
- Ken was a superstar at U of A.
I don't know about superstar.
Oh, yes.
Yes, you were.
And a second-round draft pick for the San Diego Chargers.
Went 74 yards and three receptions in his first NFL quarter, then blew out his knee.
Fucking AstroTurf.
That sucks, man.
- You really do remember everything, Johnny.
- Elephant brain.
Turtle, girls.
Watch this.
- Hey, Shelby.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Crystal.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Tiffany.
- Hi, sweetie.
- This is Bunny.
And Minx.
- Hey, Turtle.
Yo, E, be cool.
I'm cool, Vince.
I'm totally cool.
What do ya got?
Come on.
Show me a little love.
What do ya think?
Fuck!
Can I have another marker?
Please?
This is Mount Kilimanjaro, one of the tallest mountains on earth and it's freezing.
So I say to this girl,
"I'd be happy to give up my canteen for you,
"but what are you gonna give up for me?"
Fantastic.
I gotta hit the head.
I'll be right back.
So?
- I love him.
- I told you.
Let's hit the bar.
Maybe I should check on Ari, see how he's doing.
- He can't be doing any worse than you.
- Oh, it's Vinnie Chase and the chasers!
Hey, let me get a couple more Jдger shots for the boys from Queens.
- No, thanks.
- You don't drink?
Seth, I stopped drinking Jдger in high school.
But listen, I told Sloan you said, "What up."
- What did she say?
- She said, "What up."
- That's all?
- That's all.
All right.
All right.
You tell her I said, "What up" back.
Yeah, man.
Don't forget to tell her he said, "What up" back.
- What is it with them?
They're like retards.
- Yeah, but you were calm.
But is it gonna last, E?
Or are we doing battle?
We're not doin' battle.
It ain't gonna happen.
All right.
All this testosterone has put a kink in my neck.
I'll have to get Ken to work that out.
Better hurry up, Drama, he's working one out right now.
Christ almighty.
That's Amber.
Promised me three days in her father's cabin in Montana if she wins.
Turtle, I can't pick someone cos she promised to fuck you.
I don't care who wins.
I cut deals with all of 'em.
Sweetheart, this guy's with me tonight.
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to relax before the competition.
Sorry, sister, I got my own problems.
Fuck you!
I'm feeling good, Ari.
Let me sit.
- How much we down?
- 200 and fuckin' 70!
We can get that back.
- You'll get thrown out, calm down.
- He's a little upset.
I'll take another marker for 100,000, please.
Thanks, Sam.
So, Ken, did you get to sample those almonds?
They were terrific, John.
Brought me back to my childhood.
- Yeah, I knew you'd appreciate 'em.
- Oh, crap.
- They must have closed shop early tonight.
- Oh, no.
How about we meet in the morning?
There's no way I can sleep without a rubdown.
Let's take it back to my room.
- Split 'em.
- How much is that?
- 75 grand.
- Now 150.
Gotta do it.
Split 'em again.
I once saw a guy split six times straight.
- No choice.
Double down.
- Vinnie, that's 300 grand.
- We'll win it back.
- Or my kids go to community college.
I'll take this hand myself if you want.
- Sorry.
- It's OK.
I'd like to split these, please.
- Split kings?
- What's it to you?
- I don't want you fucking up my cards.
- Sir, you have to let him play his way.
- He's playing like a idiot!
- Sir...
- Ari, calm down.
- Relax.
You'll get thrown out of the casino with 300,000 on the table.
Calm down.
- Looks like I knew what I was doing.
- No, you took her break card.
Dealer has 11.
Looks like she would've had 21.
I think an apology is in order.
Shoot me and put me out of my fucking misery.
If only it weren't a crime.
Ari, remain positive.
Summon the cards you desire.
Get a higher power from above.
Come on!
- Can't hurt to try.
- Please, God, give us a 10!
Am I getting that apology?
You know what, man?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Give it to me.
You know, I don't have my table or anything, Johnny.
That's OK.
We can just use the bed, right?
- I guess.
- Cool, I'll go get changed.
Oh, Ken, I got a nice pineapple-coconut-aloe-vera gel.
Is that cool?
What the fuck are you doing, Ken?
Johnny, I have never thought about a man...
in that way.
But the adoration you poured on me today has made me feel that if... this is something that you need...
Fuck it, it is Vegas!
Looks like they started already.
No, this is just the pre-show.
We should have a post-show in the suite.
What do you say, Turtle?
I already ordered four bottles of Cristal and 400 strawberries.
Does money won feel better than money earned, or am I nuts?
You're nuts.
It's the "We don't drink Jдger" crew!
What up, E?
This fucking guy, man.
Did you tell Sloan I said, "What up" again?
No, Seth, I think one time was all she needed.
- What's that mean?
- She said you were obsessed with her.
She doesn't need to feel like you still are.
- She said I was obsessed with her?
- Yeah, sorry.
No, that's OK.
No apologies necessary.
In reality, it's more like...
she was obsessed with this.
You know what?
Keep fucking dreaming, Seth.
I must have been dreaming about how I blasted her in the face like a Jackson Pollock.
You got a problem?
- Get your fucking hand off me, man.
- No, but I do!
This ought to be good for your image, Vince.
English
So they're just gonna give him 100 grand?
Cash, in a bag, that's correct.
Just to show up to a party?
Just to show up.
You don't even have to smile, Vin.
- Only in America.
- No, only in Vegas.
So what do you say, E?
Should we go?
Well, seeing that you told the Hollywood Foreign Press that the whole town is a bunch of dickheads,
I don't think anybody's gonna miss us.
- What you're saying is, we should go.
- Have I ever said no to Vegas?
Be like saying no to a blowjob.
What do you say, Johnny?
Vegas?
Uh, love to, bro, but I'm shooting my pilot on the 30th.
- I gotta stay rested.
- You're turning down Vegas, Drama?
I'm gonna be turning down a lot of things, Turtle, now that I'm a working actor.
Better get used to it.
You know, Johnny, there are many different Vegases.
You could go and just spot.
Don't you have that masseuse you love over there?
Oh, yeah, Ken at the Hard Rock.
He's got hands of gold.
It's insane that you let a man rub your body.
No, what's insane is that you think a massage is sexual.
A real massage requires strong, manly hands, which my boy Ken has got in spades.
After 24 hours with Ken,
I'm ready for work.
Absolutely, bro, I'm in.
Nice.
Let's do it.
- Who's gonna break the news to Ari?
- Oh... be happy to.
Vin, this is not the time to go to Vegas.
You've got a serious public image problem right now.
That's why I'm going, Ari.
Hoping by the time I get back, everyone will have forgotten about it.
Come on, Vinnie, listen, we need to get you a job.
- You read any of those scripts?
- I brought 'em with.
Thought you might read 'em to me.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we could use a chaperone.
- Help keep us out of trouble.
- I'm not going to Vegas on a Wednesday.
- Come on, what else you got to do?
- I have the theater with the wife and her mother tonight.
Move over, I'm in.
Nice relaxing Wednesday may be just what I need.
Vegas, baby, Vegas!
I'm sorry, baby, you know I'd rather be at "Menopause, the Musical" tonight than here, but I got kidnapped!
- It's true!
- You see that, baby?
- Will you sign this?
- I'm sorry, honey...
- Hello?
Hello?
- Is she mad?
She said she'd rather see me gagged and bound like a real kidnappee, yeah, so I think so.
Oh, all right, here comes the apology.
Hey, baby.
I put $6 million into this company and find out at the staff meeting that you're at the roulette table?
- Oh, hey, Babs, how are ya?
- What the fuck are you doing, Ari?
I'm taking care of a high-priority client, that's what I'm doing.
- You have 150 clients to keep happy.
- ari:
Barbara...
You need to manage your time more efficiently.
- You're not my mother, Babs.
- Fuck you, Ari.
See, my mother would never speak to me that way.
I hate women!
Not all women.
Who's got five?
Ready and waiting, bro.
- What's this?
- Tradition.
When we were kids, we'd hit AC, we'd put five bucks on red.
We win, we knew it'd be a good weekend.
- ari:
What if you lose?
- Vince never loses.
Five on red.
Come on!
Red 16.
- It's gonna be a good weekend.
- Keep the change, bro.
Hey, Vinnie, what do you say we go halves?
We'll do like a gambling partnership.
- Okay, Ari, you're on.
- All right.
- Hey!
Vinnie Chase.
- Seth.
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?
You here for that thing at Body English tonight?
- Yeah.
- Cool, yeah, me too.
It should be fun.
- I brought my whole crew out.
- Definitely.
- You know Ari Gold, my agent?
- Never met, big fan.
That's funny dude.
That pinky bought me a house in Malibu.
Malibu!
And I think you know E.
How you doing, Seth?
Good to see you again.
How you doing, man?
How'd that thing work out for you at the hotel?
Like I said, it wasn't what it looked like.
Like I said, it never is.
So, how's Sloan, man?
She's still good, Seth.
Cool, hey, do me a favor.
Tell her I said "What up," okay?
Yeah, I will.
I'll tell her that.
- All right.
See ya.
- See ya.
- What's up, Seth?
- Oh, Johnny Drama.
- How you doing, man?
- Did you hear about my pilot?
- No!
Congratulations!
- Thanks, bro.
- Good for you, man!
- You could use the work.
What the fuck is up with this guy?
Every time I see him, he asks me about Sloan and he's got a shit-eating grin on his face.
- Don't get all panicky, E.
- Seriously, E, you'd be jealous if he said they were cousins.
- What does that mean?
- It means you're a jealous guy.
- Always have been.
- Bullshit.
Face it E, you're like Eric Roberts in "Star 80."
How would you know?
- I've heard stories.
- Yeah?
Name one example.
Andy Abetemarco, 10th grade.
You punched him in the head just because he got assigned to be Audrey Polini's lab partner.
There's more to that story, Turtle, he stole her frog.
- Hey, you know they got married?
- Really?
No, but see, you're still jealous.
- Whatever.
- Whatever, exactly.
- I don't think Seth meant anything.
- All right.
Nice room, Turtle.
Hey, boys, fruit's all green.
Whoa, easy with that, Ari.
It's from Body English.
Ah!
100k, Vince.
Nice.
Hey Vinnie, who'd you have to fuck to get that?
No fucking, Ari.
I just have to go to a party.
Not according to this itinerary.
Says you also gotta be at a pool event this afternoon and then drinks
- with the contestants tonight.
- Contestants?
Yeah, says you're judging a beauty contest.
- Queen of the Strip.
- Sounds like a bonus.
Sounds like I don't know what you got us into as usual.
So far it all looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Yeah, we'll see about that.
I'm gonna go check it out.
I'm comin' with you.
Hey, Vinnie, go win us some money.
God damn, I feel at ease.
I'm out.
You brought your own robe?
Why wouldn't I?
- Mind if we join you?
- Sure.
- I'll take some chips, please.
- All of it?
- Well, 10 is yours, do what you want.
- Really?
Yeah, man.
Commission.
You earned it.
Thank you, Vince!
Uh-oh.
- You... you booked him into this?
- Turtle did.
- Nice job managing.
This should be great for his image.
What are you doing?
I'm on vay-cay.
Getting a cocktail.
All right.
What are we drinking?
Yes, we have you down for it...
- Johnny!
- Hey, Ken!
- It's been a while.
- How are ya, buddy?
Good to see ya.
You look great.
You look great.
I lost a couple pounds.
- Yeah, it shows.
- Thanks.
What have you got there?
California almonds.
I remember last time I was in town you said you couldn't find a decent almond in the desert, so I thought, well...
Wow.
I can't believe you remembered.
That's really thoughtful.
I got an elephant's brain, Ken.
I remember everything.
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it,
I'm stressed like a motherfucker.
A little of that, a little of this, some of that...
All right, come on, baby!
Come on!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
He should just cancel this.
Definitely.
- He's up 2500.
- Oh yeah?
That means I'm up 1250.
Drinks are on me, E.
- One more for the road?
- Definitely.
Oh Ken, you have not lost your touch.
All these compliments are gonna make me insecure.
Well don't be.
You've got the gift.
- No doubt.
- Thanks.
In fact, I'd like to lock you down for the rest of the day.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
I'll double your rate.
'Cause I don't want these hands touching anyone but me.
Ooh...
Hit me.
- Sorry, sir.
- Hey, you can't stay hot forever.
- Hit.
- Ah, but Turtle can!
Hey, jerkoff, you signed him up
- to judge a stripper contest.
- Really?
- Titties?
- It's a stripper contest.
- Nice.
- Vin, you should cancel.
- I agree.
- Can't cancel.
Yeah, you can.
You didn't sign anything.
- Just give the money back.
- Money's gone, E.
- What are you talking about?
- I hit a little cold streak.
You lost 100 grand?
- Something like that.
- But we're partners.
Oh, shit, I forgot.
Means I'm only really down 50.
Shoulda partnered up with me, Ari.
I'm up 1200.
I get to two grand,
I'm keeping it stashed to buy me a high class ho.
But Turtle, I already gave you 10.
I only pay for pussy with profits.
I thought you never lose, Vin.
It's not a loss till we leave Nevada.
- I'll win it back.
Don't you worry.
- I'm worried, Vin.
- I'm worried!
- If you want out, cut your losses...
What, and miss the boat when you go on a million dollar run?
- No way, count me in.
- All right.
Vince, you gotta blow off this stripper thing, man.
- No, let's go, it'll be fun.
- It will be.
And we gotta be at the pool for the meet-and-greet in five minutes.
- That'll definitely be fun.
- Let's do it.
Fuck the pool, let's win our money back.
You don't care about him judging a stripper contest, Ari?
Which is worse for his image?
That he judges a stripper contest, or he loses a couple hundred thousand at the fucking tables?
Table's not going anywhere, calm down.
Hey, yo, E!
Hey, did you tell Sloan I said "What up"?
- No, Seth.
- Why not?
Because it was like a half an hour ago.
It's just a phone call, man.
Make the call.
- Say "What up."
- Yeah, E.
Make the call, say "What up."
So this dickhead is saying what, that he fucked my girlfriend?
I don't know, E.
It's hard to say what he was saying.
It's not hard to say.
Seth Green landed on Plymouth Rock
- before you did, E. Wake up.
- No shot.
I'm so not interested in this!
Can we please go out there and win some money?
- Please, Vinnie!
- The strippers aren't even here yet.
Look, E, it could've been years ago.
The guy's been running around Hollywood since he was like 12.
And Sloan does like her men petite.
Fuck that.
I know every guy she's been with.
How?
What, did you make a list?
Yeah, Turtle.
Couples make lists.
You wouldn't know that for obvious reasons.
Where the fuck are these girls!
Somebody...
What Ari, you and your wife didn't make lists?
- We did.
I'm the only one on it.
- Yeah, right.
Look E, I don't wanna rile you up, but I've done the list thing.
What, did you hand over a hard drive, Vin?
It was big.
But I did leave some off.
Everyone does.
So what, you're saying that... that Sloan left Seth Green off the list?
I think everybody leaves someone off the list.
Except you.
I'm calling.
Ain't you gonna call your wife, Ari?
I don't care if my wife's getting fucked right now, Turtle,
I need to get my money back!
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello.
I'm Joanne, but I go by the stage name of Cheyenne.
I understand you're judging the contest.
- Yes...
- Is there anything I can do
- to get you to vote for me?
- Yeah, Vince, what's a girl gotta do to get a vote around here?
Come on, Vince, we're gonna get stuck here all day.
Let's go.
Girls, due to circumstances beyond my control...
- Me!
- I have to go.
But talk to my boy, Turtle, here.
He's the eyes, mouth and ears of this operation.
- Enjoy.
- First, the commission, now this?
This is like Christmas.
- Hi, Turtle.
- How you doin'?
So you're really his eyes and ears?
Ken, whatever happened to that pretty little
Filipino girlfriend of yours, Annie?
Sore subject.
She just moved out a week ago.
Fuck her.
Hands like yours... her loss.
- Still hurts.
- Yeah, I hear you, Ken.
You know what?
Johnny Drama's got just the cure for your heartbreak.
Really?
What's that?
Boys' night out.
Just a good steak, nice bottle of red, couple cigars and some good conversation.
You do that, Ken, and you'll forget all about women in no time.
I don't usually go out socially with clients, Johnny.
Ken, I'd like to think after all this time you look at me as more than just a client.
Oh, Eric.
He's so annoying.
Annoying how?
We were on a teen tour together, and he was obsessed with me for like the entire trip.
- But you never dated him?
- No, Eric, I never dated him.
This is a tough competition, girls, and what, with a $25,000 prize, everybody needs an edge.
Fortunately for you,
I left my integrity back in Los Angeles.
My vote is 100% for sale.
Hit me.
Jesus!
ARl:
What the fuck are you smirking about?
Huh?
Where are you going?
Oh, I'm not feeling it right now.
You can't force the cards.
- How much are we down?
- Uh, 110.
Each.
Jesus!
- We'll get it back after dinner.
- I'm not hungry, Vinnie.
You take the reins, maybe you'll have better luck.
Don't go too crazy, I don't wanna lose more than 500 grand.
Bring it.
Bring it!
So you talked to her,
- and she said nothing happened?
- Right.
Why's he trying to make it like something did?
'Cause he's a jerkoff.
- Why are you so calm?
- The old E would not have been able to control himself.
The old E, "Mad Dog" E, woulda bit Seth Green's ear off.
Guys, I'm a grown man.
I don't fight anymore.
Oh, way to be mature.
Yeah, you're really entering your latter years gracefully.
Speaking of latter years...
Fuck off, E.
How relaxed do I look?
Mmm, you look like you died in 1983.
Wait till you see me after a shower,
I'm gonna sparkle like the 4th of July.
Wait till you see dinner.
I got 10 of the best strippers in town
- joining us tonight.
- Oooh!
Strippers?
Why?
Now, shouldn't it be, strippers, how
- and thank you?
- Thank you.
Look, we don't want girls at the table tonight.
I'm just trying to keep this trip free of distractions.
We?
Who's we?
Ken.
He's gonna be joining us tonight.
You don't want strippers at dinner 'cause your gay masseuse is joining us?
I'm really starting to worry about you, Drama.
Oh please, Turtle, Ken is not gay.
In fact, if I release him on the strippers tonight, you're gonna be shit out of luck.
Oh, please.
Bring it on.
So, have you seen "Brokeback Mountain," Kenneth?
Nah.
I don't get to the movies.
When I'm not working, I'm usually training.
- Training for what?
- Well, it's probably too late for me, but I still dream of the NFL.
- You play ball?
- Ken was a superstar at U of A.
I don't know about superstar.
Oh, yes.
Yes you were.
And a second-round draft pick for the San Diego Chargers.
Went 74 yards and three receptions in his first NFL quarter, then blew out his knee.
Fucking Astroturf.
That sucks, man.
You really do remember everything, Johnny.
- Elephant brain.
- Turtle, girls.
Watch this.
- Hey, Shelby.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Crystal.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Tiffany.
- Hi, sweetie.
- This is Bunny.
- Hey, Turtle.
And Minx.
Yo, E, be cool.
I'm cool, Vince.
I'm totally cool.
What do ya got, what do ya got?
Come on, come on.
Show me a little love, little love, little love.
What do ya think... fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Can I have another marker?
Please?
Please...
This is Mt.
Kilimanjaro, one of the tallest mountains on earth and it's freezing.
So I say to this girl,
"I'd be happy to give up my canteen for you, but what are you gonna give up for me?"
Fantastic.
Oh, Ken.
I gotta hit the head.
I'll be right back.
So?
- I love him.
- I told you.
Let's hit the bar.
Maybe I should check on Ari, see how he's doing.
He can't be doing any worse than you.
Oh, it's Vinnie Chase and the chasers!
Hey, let me get a couple more Jager shots
- for the boys from Queens over there.
- No thanks.
What's the matter, you don't drink, Eric?
I drink vodka, Seth.
I stopped drinking Jager in high school.
Oh!
But listen, I told Sloan you said "What up."
Mmm.
What'd she say?
She said "What up."
- That's all?
- That's all.
All right.
All right.
You tell her I said "What up" back.
Yeah, man.
Don't forget to tell her he said "What up" back.
What is wrong with these guys?
They're like retards.
Yeah, but you were calm.
Yeah, but is it gonna last though, E?
Or are we doing battle?
We're not doin' battle, Drama.
It ain't gonna happen.
All right.
All this testosterone has put a kink in my neck.
I'm gonna have to get Ken to work that out.
Better hurry up, Drama, looks like he's working one out right now.
Christ almighty.
Oh, that's Amber.
Country girl, promised me three days in her father's cabin in Montana if she wins.
Turtle, I know it's a stripper contest, but I can't pick someone 'cause she promised to fuck you.
I don't care who wins.
I cut deals with all of 'em.
Uh, sweetheart, this guy's with me tonight.
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to relax before the competition.
Sorry, sister, I got my own problems.
Fuck you!
- I'm feeling good, Ari.
Let me sit.
- Ari, relax.
- How much we down?
- 200 and fuckin' 70!
We can get that back.
You're gonna get thrown outta here, calm down.
He's a little upset.
I'll take another marker for 100,000 please.
Thanks, Sam.
So, Ken, did you get to sample those almonds I gave you?
Oh, they were terrific, John.
Brought me right back to my childhood.
Yeah, I knew you'd appreciate 'em.
Oh, crap.
They must have closed shop early tonight.
Oh, no, no, no...
How 'bout we just reconvene in the morning?
No, no.
There's no way I can sleep without a rubdown.
Let's take it back to my room, huh?
Uh... yeah... okay.
- Split 'em.
- How much is that?
- 75 grand.
- Now 150.
Gotta do it.
Split 'em again.
I once saw a guy split six times straight.
- No choice.
Double down.
- Vinnie, that's 300 grand.
We're gonna win it all back on this hand.
Yeah, or my kids are going to community college.
I'll take this hand myself if you want.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
I'd like to split these please.
- You're gonna split kings?
!
- Yeah.
What's it to you?
I got 150 grand on this hand, I don't want you fucking up my cards.
Sir, you have to let him play his way.
- He's playing like a fucking idiot!
- Sir...
- Ari, calm down.
- Ari, relax.
You're gonna get thrown out of the casino with 300,000 on the table.
- Calm down...
- We'll take care of it later, Ari.
Looks like I knew what I was doing, huh?
No, it looks like you took her break card.
Dealer has 11.
Looks like she would've had 21.
I think an apology is in order.
Oh!
Somebody shoot me and put me out of my fucking misery.
If only it weren't a crime.
Ari, remain positive.
Summon the cards you desire.
Get a higher power from above.
Come on!
Can't hurt to try.
Please, God, give us another 10!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Am I getting that apology?
You know what, man?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Give it to me.
You know, I don't have my table or anything, Johnny.
That's okay.
We can just use the bed, right?
- I guess.
- Cool, I'll go get changed.
Oh, hey, Ken, I got a nice pineapple- coconut-aloe-vera gel.
Is that cool?
What the fuck are you doing, Ken?
Johnny, I have never thought about a man...
in that way.
But the adoration you have poured on me today has made me feel that if... this is something that you need, fuck it... it is Vegas!
Johnny!
Looks like they started already.
No, this is just the pre-show.
Well, now that we're up 100 grand, we should have a post-show up in the suite.
What do you say, Turtle?
I already ordered four bottles of Cristal and 400 chocolate-covered strawberries.
- Nice.
- Does money won feel better
- than money earned, or am I nuts?
- You're nuts.
Oh!
It's the "We don't drink Jager" crew!
What up, E?
This fucking guy, man.
Hey, did you tell Sloan I said "What up" again?
No, Seth, I think one time was all she needed.
What's that mean?
It means she said you used to be obsessed with her.
I don't think she needs to feel like you're still obsessed with her.
- She said I was obsessed with her?
- Yeah, sorry to say.
No, that's all right.
No apologies necessary.
I mean, in reality, it's more like... she was obsessed with this.
Hey, you know what?
Keep fucking dreaming, Seth.
- Keep dreaming.
- Oh, you're right.
I must have been dreaming about how I blasted her in the face like a Jackson Pollock.
You got a problem?
- Get your fucking hand off me, man.
- No, but I do!
This ought to be good for your image, Vince.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
So they're just gonna give him 100 grand?
Cash, in a bag, that's correct.
Just to show up to a party?
Just to show up.
You don't even have to smile, Vin.
- Only in America.
- No, only in Vegas.
So what do you say, E?
Should we go?
Well, seeing that you told the Hollywood Foreign Press that the whole town is a bunch of dickheads,
I don't think anybody's gonna miss us.
- What you're saying is, we should go.
- Have I ever said no to Vegas?
Be like saying no to a blowjob.
What do you say, Johnny?
Vegas?
Uh, love to, bro, but I'm shooting my pilot on the 30th.
- I gotta stay rested.
- You're turning down Vegas, Drama?
I'm gonna be turning down a lot of things, Turtle, now that I'm a working actor.
Better get used to it.
You know, Johnny, there are many different Vegases.
You could go and just spot.
Don't you have that masseuse you love over there?
Oh, yeah, Ken at the Hard Rock.
- (CORK POPS)
- He's got hands of gold.
It's insane that you let a man rub your body.
No, what's insane is that you think a massage is sexual.
A real massage requires strong, manly hands, which my boy Ken has got in spades.
After 24 hours with Ken,
I'm ready for work.
Absolutely, bro, I'm in.
Nice.
Let's do it.
- Who's gonna break the news to Ari?
- Oh... be happy to.
Vin, this is not the time to go to Vegas.
You've got a serious public image problem right now.
That's why I'm going, Ari.
Hoping by the time I get back, everyone will have forgotten about it.
Come on, Vinnie, listen, we need to get you a job.
- You read any of those scripts?
- I brought 'em with.
Thought you might read 'em to me.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we could use a chaperone.
- Help keep us out of trouble.
- I'm not going to Vegas on a Wednesday.
- Come on, what else you got to do?
- I have the theater with the wife and her mother tonight.
Move over, I'm in.
Nice relaxing Wednesday may be just what I need.
DRAMA:
Vegas, baby, Vegas!
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
I'm sorry, baby, you know I'd rather be at "Menopause, the Musical" tonight than here, but I got kidnapped!
- It's true!
- You see that, baby?
- Will you sign this?
- I'm sorry, honey...
- Hello?
Hello?
- Is she mad?
She said she'd rather see me gagged and bound like a real kidnappee, yeah, so I think so.
(PHONE RINGING)
Oh, all right, here comes the apology.
Hey, baby.
I put $6 million into this company and find out at the staff meeting that you're at the roulette table?
- Oh, hey, Babs, how are ya?
- What the fuck are you doing, Ari?
I'm taking care of a high-priority client, that's what I'm doing.
- You have 150 clients to keep happy.
- ari:
Barbara...
You need to manage your time more efficiently.
- You're not my mother, Babs.
- Fuck you, Ari.
See, my mother would never speak to me that way.
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- I hate women!
- Not all women.
- (LAUGHING)
Who's got five?
Ready and waiting, bro.
- What's this?
- Tradition.
When we were kids, we'd hit AC, we'd put five bucks on red.
We win, we knew it'd be a good weekend.
ARl:
What if you lose?
TURTLE:
Vince never loses.
Five on red.
TURTLE:
Come on!
- DEALER:
Red 16.
- (CHEERING)
- It's gonna be a good weekend.
- Keep the change, bro.
Hey, Vinnie, what do you say we go halves?
We'll do like a gambling partnership.
- Okay, Ari, you're on.
- All right.
- Hey!
Vinnie Chase.
- Seth.
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?
You here for that thing at Body English tonight?
- Yeah.
- Cool, yeah, me too.
It should be fun.
- I brought my whole crew out.
- Definitely.
- You know Ari Gold, my agent?
- Never met, big fan.
(CHUCKLES) That's funny dude.
That pinky bought me a house in Malibu.
(IMITATING DR. EVIL) Malibu!
And I think you know E.
How you doing, Seth?
Good to see you again.
How you doing, man?
How'd that thing work out for you at the hotel?
Like I said, it wasn't what it looked like.
Like I said, it never is.
So, how's Sloan, man?
She's still good, Seth.
Cool, hey, do me a favor.
Tell her I said "What up," okay?
Yeah, I will.
I'll tell her that.
- All right.
See ya.
- VINCE:
See ya.
- What's up, Seth?
- Oh, Johnny Drama.
- How you doing, man?
- Did you hear about my pilot?
- No!
Congratulations!
- Thanks, bro.
Good for you, man!
You could use the work. (SNICKERS)
What the fuck is up with this guy?
Every time I see him, he asks me about Sloan and he's got a shit-eating grin on his face.
- Don't get all panicky, E.
- Seriously, E, you'd be jealous if he said they were cousins.
- What does that mean?
- It means you're a jealous guy.
- TURTLE:
Always have been.
- Bullshit.
Face it E, you're like Eric Roberts in "Star 80."
How would you know?
- I've heard stories.
- Yeah?
Name one example.
Andy Abetemarco, 10th grade.
You punched him in the head just because he got assigned to be Audrey Polini's lab partner.
There's more to that story, Turtle, he stole her frog.
- Hey, you know they got married?
- Really?
No, but see, you're still jealous.
- Whatever.
- Whatever, exactly.
- I don't think Seth meant anything.
- All right.
Nice room, Turtle.
Hey, boys, fruit's all green.
Whoa, easy with that, Ari.
It's from Body English.
(SNIFFS) Ah!
100k, Vince.
(SNIFFS) Nice.
Hey Vinnie, who'd you have to fuck to get that?
No fucking, Ari.
I just have to go to a party.
Not according to this itinerary.
Says you also gotta be at a pool event this afternoon and then drinks
- with the contestants tonight.
- Contestants?
Yeah, says you're judging a beauty contest.
- Queen of the Strip.
- Sounds like a bonus.
Sounds like I don't know what you got us into as usual.
So far it all looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Yeah, we'll see about that.
I'm gonna go check it out.
I'm comin' with you.
Hey, Vinnie, go win us some money.
God damn, I feel at ease.
I'm out.
E:
You brought your own robe?
Why wouldn't I?
(SCOFFS)
(LAUGHS)
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)
(CHEERING)
- Mind if we join you?
- WOMAN:
Sure.
- I'll take some chips, please.
- All of it?
- Well, 10 is yours, do what you want.
- Really?
Yeah, man.
Commission.
You earned it.
(LAUGHS) Thank you, Vince!
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)
(CHATTERING, LAUGHING)
- E:
Uh-oh.
- You... you booked him into this?
- Turtle did.
- Nice job managing.
This should be great for his image.
E:
What are you doing?
I'm on vay-cay.
Getting a cocktail.
- (CAMERAS CLICKING)
- All right.
What are we drinking?
WOMAN:
Yes, we have you down for it...
- Johnny!
- Hey, Ken!
- It's been a while.
- How are ya, buddy?
(CHUCKLES)
Good to see ya.
You look great.
You look great.
I lost a couple pounds.
- Yeah, it shows.
- Thanks.
What have you got there?
California almonds.
I remember last time I was in town you said you couldn't find a decent almond in the desert, so I thought, well...
Wow.
I can't believe you remembered.
That's really thoughtful.
I got an elephant's brain, Ken.
I remember everything.
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it,
I'm stressed like a motherfucker.
VINCE:
A little of that, a little of this, some of that...
All right, come on, baby!
Come on!
- Yes!
- (SCREAMING, CHEERING)
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)
He should just cancel this.
Definitely.
- He's up 2500.
- Oh yeah?
That means I'm up 1250.
Drinks are on me, E.
- One more for the road?
- Definitely.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh Ken, you have not lost your touch.
All these compliments are gonna make me insecure.
Well don't be.
You've got the gift.
- No doubt.
- Thanks.
In fact, I'd like to lock you down for the rest of the day.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
I'll double your rate.
'Cause I don't want these hands touching anyone but me.
Ooh...
Hit me.
- DEALER:
Sorry, sir.
- Hey, you can't stay hot forever.
- Hit.
- Ah, but Turtle can!
Hey, jerkoff, you signed him up
- to judge a stripper contest.
- Really?
- Titties?
- It's a stripper contest.
- Nice.
- Vin, you should cancel.
- I agree.
- Can't cancel.
Yeah, you can.
You didn't sign anything.
- Just give the money back.
- Money's gone, E.
- What are you talking about?
- I hit a little cold streak.
E:
You lost 100 grand?
- Something like that.
- But we're partners.
Oh, shit, I forgot.
Means I'm only really down 50.
(CHUCKLES)
Shoulda partnered up with me, Ari.
I'm up 1200.
I get to two grand,
I'm keeping it stashed to buy me a high class ho.
But Turtle, I already gave you 10.
I only pay for pussy with profits.
I thought you never lose, Vin.
It's not a loss till we leave Nevada.
- I'll win it back.
Don't you worry.
- I'm worried, Vin.
- I'm worried!
- If you want out, cut your losses...
What, and miss the boat when you go on a million dollar run?
- No way, count me in.
- All right.
Vince, you gotta blow off this stripper thing, man.
- No, let's go, it'll be fun.
- TURTLE:
It will be.
And we gotta be at the pool for the meet-and-greet in five minutes.
- That'll definitely be fun.
- Let's do it.
Fuck the pool, let's win our money back.
You don't care about him judging a stripper contest, Ari?
Which is worse for his image?
That he judges a stripper contest, or he loses a couple hundred thousand at the fucking tables?
Table's not going anywhere, calm down.
Hey, yo, E!
Hey, did you tell Sloan I said "What up"?
- No, Seth.
- Why not?
Because it was like a half an hour ago.
It's just a phone call, man.
Make the call.
- Say "What up."
- Yeah, E.
Make the call, say "What up."
So this dickhead is saying what, that he fucked my girlfriend?
I don't know, E.
It's hard to say what he was saying.
It's not hard to say.
Seth Green landed on Plymouth Rock
- before you did, E. Wake up.
- No shot.
I'm so not interested in this!
Can we please go out there and win some money?
- Please, Vinnie!
- The strippers aren't even here yet.
Look, E, it could've been years ago.
The guy's been running around Hollywood since he was like 12.
And Sloan does like her men petite.
Fuck that.
I know every guy she's been with.
How?
What, did you make a list?
Yeah, Turtle.
Couples make lists.
You wouldn't know that for obvious reasons.
Where the fuck are these girls!
Somebody...
What Ari, you and your wife didn't make lists?
- We did.
I'm the only one on it.
- Yeah, right.
Look E, I don't wanna rile you up, but I've done the list thing.
What, did you hand over a hard drive, Vin?
It was big.
But I did leave some off.
Everyone does.
So what, you're saying that... that Sloan left Seth Green off the list?
I think everybody leaves someone off the list.
Except you.
I'm calling.
Ain't you gonna call your wife, Ari?
I don't care if my wife's getting fucked right now, Turtle,
I need to get my money back!
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello.
I'm Joanne, but I go by the stage name of Cheyenne.
I understand you're judging the contest.
- Yes...
- Is there anything I can do
- to get you to vote for me?
- Yeah, Vince, what's a girl gotta do to get a vote around here?
Come on, Vince, we're gonna get stuck here all day.
Let's go.
Girls, due to circumstances beyond my control...
- Me!
- I have to go.
But talk to my boy, Turtle, here.
He's the eyes, mouth and ears of this operation.
- Enjoy.
- First, the commission, now this?
This is like Christmas.
- Hi, Turtle.
- How you doin'?
So you're really his eyes and ears?
Ken, whatever happened to that pretty little
Filipino girlfriend of yours, Annie?
Sore subject.
She just moved out a week ago.
Fuck her.
Hands like yours...
her loss.
- Still hurts.
- Yeah, I hear you, Ken.
You know what?
Johnny Drama's got just the cure for your heartbreak.
Really?
What's that?
Boys' night out.
Just a good steak, nice bottle of red, couple cigars and some good conversation.
You do that, Ken, and you'll forget all about women in no time.
I don't usually go out socially with clients, Johnny.
Ken, I'd like to think after all this time you look at me as more than just a client.
Oh, Eric.
He's so annoying.
Annoying how?
We were on a teen tour together, and he was obsessed with me for like the entire trip.
- But you never dated him?
- No, Eric, I never dated him.
TURTLE:
This is a tough competition, girls, and what, with a $25,000 prize, everybody needs an edge.
Fortunately for you,
I left my integrity back in Los Angeles.
- (GIRLS LAUGH)
- My vote is 100% for sale.
Hit me.
Jesus!
ARl:
What the fuck are you smirking about?
Huh?
Where are you going?
Oh, I'm not feeling it right now.
You can't force the cards.
- How much are we down?
- Uh, 110.
Each.
Jesus!
- We'll get it back after dinner.
- I'm not hungry, Vinnie.
You take the reins, maybe you'll have better luck.
Don't go too crazy, I don't wanna lose more than 500 grand.
Bring it.
Bring it!
So you talked to her,
- and she said nothing happened?
- Right.
Why's he trying to make it like something did?
'Cause he's a jerkoff.
- Why are you so calm?
- The old E would not have been able to control himself.
The old E, "Mad Dog" E, woulda bit Seth Green's ear off.
Guys, I'm a grown man.
I don't fight anymore.
Oh, way to be mature.
Yeah, you're really entering your latter years gracefully.
- E:
Speaking of latter years...
- (LAUGHS)
Fuck off, E. (CHUCKLES)
How relaxed do I look?
Mmm, you look like you died in 1983.
Wait till you see me after a shower,
I'm gonna sparkle like the 4th of July.
Wait till you see dinner.
I got 10 of the best strippers in town
- joining us tonight.
- VINCE:
Oooh!
Strippers?
Why?
Now, shouldn't it be, strippers, how
- and thank you?
- Thank you.
Look, we don't want girls at the table tonight.
I'm just trying to keep this trip free of distractions.
We?
Who's we?
Ken.
He's gonna be joining us tonight.
(SCOFFS) You don't want strippers at dinner 'cause your gay masseuse is joining us?
I'm really starting to worry about you, Drama.
Oh please, Turtle, Ken is not gay.
In fact, if I release him on the strippers tonight, you're gonna be shit out of luck.
- (LAUGHS)
- Oh, please.
Bring it on.
TURTLE:
So, have you seen "Brokeback Mountain," Kenneth?
Nah.
I don't get to the movies.
When I'm not working, I'm usually training.
- Training for what?
- Well, it's probably too late for me, but I still dream of the NFL.
- You play ball?
- Ken was a superstar at U of A.
I don't know about superstar.
Oh, yes.
Yes you were.
And a second-round draft pick for the San Diego Chargers.
Went 74 yards and three receptions in his first NFL quarter, then blew out his knee.
- (GROANS)
- Fucking Astroturf.
That sucks, man.
You really do remember everything, Johnny.
- Elephant brain.
- Turtle, girls.
Watch this.
- Hey, Shelby.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Crystal.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Tiffany.
- Hi, sweetie.
- This is Bunny.
- Hey, Turtle.
And Minx.
Yo, E, be cool.
(LAUGHS) I'm cool, Vince.
I'm totally cool.
What do ya got, what do ya got?
Come on, come on.
Show me a little love, little love, little love.
What do ya think...
fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Can I have another marker?
Please?
Please...
- (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) - (CROWD CHATTERING)
(GIGGLING)
This is Mt.
Kilimanjaro, one of the tallest mountains on earth and it's freezing.
So I say to this girl,
"I'd be happy to give up my canteen for you, but what are you gonna give up for me?"
- (LAUGHING)
- Fantastic.
Oh, Ken.
I gotta hit the head.
I'll be right back.
So?
- I love him.
- I told you.
Let's hit the bar.
Maybe I should check on Ari, see how he's doing.
He can't be doing any worse than you.
Oh, it's Vinnie Chase and the chasers!
Hey, let me get a couple more Jager shots
- for the boys from Queens over there.
- No thanks.
What's the matter, you don't drink, Eric?
I drink vodka, Seth.
I stopped drinking Jager in high school.
(CHUCKLES)
Oh!
(LAUGHS)
But listen, I told Sloan you said "What up."
Mmm.
What'd she say?
She said "What up."
- That's all?
- That's all.
All right.
All right.
You tell her I said "What up" back.
Yeah, man.
Don't forget to tell her he said "What up" back.
(SCOFFS)
What is wrong with these guys?
They're like retards.
Yeah, but you were calm.
Yeah, but is it gonna last though, E?
Or are we doing battle?
We're not doin' battle, Drama.
It ain't gonna happen.
All right.
All this testosterone has put a kink in my neck.
I'm gonna have to get Ken to work that out.
Better hurry up, Drama, looks like he's working one out right now.
Christ almighty.
- (LAUGHING)
- Oh, that's Amber.
TURTLE:
Country girl, promised me three days in her father's cabin in Montana if she wins.
Turtle, I know it's a stripper contest, but I can't pick someone 'cause she promised to fuck you.
I don't care who wins.
I cut deals with all of 'em.
Uh, sweetheart, this guy's with me tonight.
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to relax before the competition.
Sorry, sister, I got my own problems.
Fuck you!
- I'm feeling good, Ari.
Let me sit.
- Ari, relax.
- How much we down?
- 200 and fuckin' 70!
We can get that back.
You're gonna get thrown outta here, calm down.
He's a little upset.
I'll take another marker for 100,000 please.
Thanks, Sam.
So, Ken, did you get to sample those almonds I gave you?
- Oh, they were terrific, John.
- (CHUCKLES)
Brought me right back to my childhood.
Yeah, I knew you'd appreciate 'em.
Oh, crap.
They must have closed shop early tonight.
Oh, no, no, no...
How 'bout we just reconvene in the morning?
No, no.
There's no way I can sleep without a rubdown.
Let's take it back to my room, huh?
Uh...
yeah... okay.
- Split 'em.
- How much is that?
- 75 grand.
- Now 150.
- (DEALER CHUCKLES)
- Gotta do it.
Split 'em again.
I once saw a guy split six times straight.
- No choice.
Double down.
- Vinnie, that's 300 grand.
We're gonna win it all back on this hand.
Yeah, or my kids are going to community college.
I'll take this hand myself if you want.
(GROWLS)
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
I'd like to split these please.
- You're gonna split kings?
!
- Yeah.
What's it to you?
I got 150 grand on this hand, I don't want you fucking up my cards.
Sir, you have to let him play his way.
- He's playing like a fucking idiot!
- Sir...
VINCE:
Ari, calm down.
E:
Ari, relax.
You're gonna get thrown out of the casino with 300,000 on the table.
- Calm down...
- We'll take care of it later, Ari.
(CHUCKLING) Looks like I knew what I was doing, huh?
No, it looks like you took her break card.
DEALER:
Dealer has 11.
Looks like she would've had 21.
I think an apology is in order.
- Oh!
- (CROWD GROANS)
Somebody shoot me and put me out of my fucking misery.
If only it weren't a crime.
Ari, remain positive.
Summon the cards you desire.
Get a higher power from above.
Come on!
E:
Can't hurt to try.
Please, God, give us another 10!
- (CHEERING)
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Am I getting that apology?
You know what, man?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Give it to me.
KEN:
You know, I don't have my table or anything, Johnny.
That's okay.
We can just use the bed, right?
- I guess.
- Cool, I'll go get changed.
(DRAMA WHISTLING)
Oh, hey, Ken, I got a nice pineapple- coconut-aloe-vera gel.
Is that cool?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) What the fuck are you doing, Ken?
Johnny, I have never thought about a man...
in that way.
But the adoration you have poured on me today has made me feel that if... this is something that you need, fuck it...
it is Vegas!
(GRUNTS)
Johnny!
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
(MEN CHEERING, HOLLERING)
VINCE:
Looks like they started already.
No, this is just the pre-show.
Well, now that we're up 100 grand, we should have a post-show up in the suite.
What do you say, Turtle?
I already ordered four bottles of Cristal and 400 chocolate-covered strawberries.
- Nice.
- Does money won feel better
- than money earned, or am I nuts?
- You're nuts.
Oh!
It's the "We don't drink Jager" crew!
What up, E?
This fucking guy, man.
Hey, did you tell Sloan I said "What up" again?
No, Seth, I think one time was all she needed.
What's that mean?
It means she said you used to be obsessed with her.
I don't think she needs to feel like you're still obsessed with her.
- She said I was obsessed with her?
- Yeah, sorry to say.
No, that's all right.
No apologies necessary.
I mean, in reality, it's more like... she was obsessed with this.
Hey, you know what?
Keep fucking dreaming, Seth.
- Keep dreaming.
- Oh, you're right.
I must have been dreaming about how I blasted her in the face like a Jackson Pollock.
- (LAUGHING)
- You got a problem?
- Get your fucking hand off me, man.
- No, but I do!
(GRUNTING)
- (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) - (GLASS SHATTERING)
This ought to be good for your image, Vince.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
- So they're just gonna give him 100 grand?
- Cash in a bag.
- Just to show up to a party?
- You don't even have to smile, Vin.
- Only in America.
- No, only in Vegas.
So what do you say, E?
Should we go?
As you told Hollywood the town is a bunch of dickheads, I don't think anybody will miss us.
- So you say we should go.
- Have I ever said no to Vegas?
Be like saying no to a blowjob.
What do you say, Johnny?
Vegas?
Love to, bro, but I'm shooting my pilot on the 30th.
- I gotta stay rested.
- You're turning down Vegas?
I'll turn down a lot of things, Turtle, now I'm a working actor.
Get used to it.
Johnny, there are many different Vegases.
You could go and just spot.
Don't you have a masseuse you love over there?
Yeah, Ken at the Hard Rock.
He's got hands of gold.
It's insane that you let a man rub your body.
What's insane is that you think a massage is sexual.
A real massage requires strong, manly hands, which my boy Ken has got in spades.
After 24 hours with Ken, I'm ready for work.
Absolutely, bro, I'm in.
Nice.
Let's do it.
- Who's gonna break the news to Ari?
- Be happy to.
Vin, this is not the time to go to Vegas.
You've got a public image problem.
Hoping by the time I get back, everyone will have forgotten.
Vinnie, we need to get you a job.
You read any of those scripts?
I thought you might read 'em to me.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we could use a chaperone.
- Keep us out of trouble.
- I'm not going to Vegas on a Wednesday.
- What else you got to do?
- The theatre with the wife and her mother.
Move over, I'm in.
Nice, relaxing Wednesday may be just what I need.
Vegas, baby, Vegas!
I'm sorry, baby.
I'd rather be at Menopause, the Musical tonight, but I got kidnapped!
- It's true!
- You see that, baby?
I'm sorry, honey...
- Hello?
Hello?
- Is she mad?
She said she'd rather see me gagged and bound like a real kidnappee, so I think so.
Here comes the apology.
Hey, baby.
I put $6 million into this company and find out that you're at the roulette table?
- Babs, how are ya?
- What are you doing, Ari?
I'm taking care of a high-priority client.
You have 150 clients.
You need to manage your time more efficiently.
- You're not my mother, Babs.
- Fuck you, Ari.
See, my mother would never speak to me that way.
I hate women!
Not all women.
Who's got five?
- Ready and waiting, bro.
- What's this?
As kids we'd put five bucks on red.
We win, we knew it'd be a good weekend.
- What if you lose?
- Vince never loses.
Five on red.
Come on!
Red 16.
- It's gonna be a good weekend.
- Keep the change.
Hey, Vinnie, shall we go halves?
A gambling partnership.
- OK, Ari.
- All right.
- Vinnie Chase.
- Seth.
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?
Are you here for that thing at Body English?
It should be fun.
- I brought my crew.
- You know Ari Gold, my agent?
Never met, big fan.
That's funny, dude.
That pinky bought me a house in Malibu.
Malibu!
And I think you know E.
- Seth, good to see you.
- How'd that thing work out for you at the hotel?
- Like I said, it wasn't what it looked like.
- Like I said, it never is.
How's Sloan, man?
She's still good, Seth.
Do me a favour.
Tell her I said, "What up".
- I will.
I'll tell her that.
- All right.
See ya.
- What's up, Seth?
- Johnny Drama.
How you doing?
- Did you hear about my pilot?
- No.
Congratulations!
- Thanks, bro.
- Good for you, man!
You could use the work.
Every time I see him, he asks me about Sloan and he's got a shit-eating grin on his face.
- Don't panic, E.
- You'd be jealous if he said they were cousins.
- What does that mean?
- You're a jealous guy.
- Always have been.
- Bullshit.
- E, you're like Eric Roberts in Star 80.
- How would you know?
- I've heard stories.
- Name one example.
Andy Abetemarco.
You punched him because he got to be Audrey Polini's lab partner.
There's more to that story, he stole her frog.
- They got married.
- Really?
- No, but you're still jealous.
- Whatever.
- Exactly.
I don't think Seth meant anything.
- All right.
Nice room, Turtle.
Boys, fruit's all green.
Easy with that, Ari.
It's from Body English.
100K, Vince.
- Nice.
- Vinnie, who'd you have to fuck to get that?
- No fucking, Ari.
I just have to go to a party.
- Not according to this.
You got a pool event and then drinks with the contestants tonight.
Contestants?
- Says you're judging a beauty contest.
- Sounds like a bonus.
- I don't know what you got us into.
- So far it all looks pretty good.
We'll see.
I'm gonna check it out.
I'm comin' with you.
Vinnie, go win us some money.
Goddamn, I feel at ease.
I'm out.
You brought your own robe?
Why wouldn't I?
- Mind if we join you?
- Sure.
- I'll take some chips, please.
- All of it?
- Well, 10 is yours, do what you want.
- Really?
- Yeah, man.
Commission.
You earned it.
- Thank you, Vince!
You booked him into this?
- Turtle did.
- Nice job managing.
This should be great for his image.
- What are you doing?
- I'm on vay-cay.
Getting a cocktail.
All right.
What are we drinking?
- It's been a while.
- How are ya, buddy?
Good to see ya.
You look great.
You look great.
I lost a couple pounds.
- Yeah, it shows.
- Thanks.
What have you got there?
California almonds.
I remember last time I was in town you said you couldn't find a decent almond in the desert, so I thought, well...
I can't believe you remembered.
That's really thoughtful.
I got an elephant's brain.
I remember everything.
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it,
I'm stressed like a motherfucker.
A little of that, a little of this, some of that...
All right, come on, baby!
Come on!
- He should just cancel this.
- Definitely.
- He's up 2500.
- Oh yeah?
That means I'm up 1250.
Drinks are on me, E.
- One more for the road?
- Definitely.
Ken, you have not lost your touch.
These compliments are gonna make me insecure.
Well, don't be.
You've got the gift.
- No doubt.
- Thanks.
In fact, I'd like to lock you down for the rest of the day.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
I'll double your rate.
Cos I don't want these hands touching anyone but me.
Hit me.
- Sorry, sir.
- Hey, you can't stay hot forever.
- Hit.
- But Turtle can!
Hey, you signed him up to judge a stripper contest.
- Really?
Titties?
- It's a stripper contest.
- Nice.
- Vin, you should cancel.
- I agree.
- Can't cancel.
- You can.
Give the money back.
- Money's gone.
- What?
- I hit a cold streak.
- You lost 100 grand?
- Something like that.
- But we're partners.
- Shit, I forgot.
Means I'm only really down 50.
Shoulda partnered up with me, Ari.
I'm up 1200.
I get to two grand, I'm keeping it stashed to buy me a high class ho.
- But Turtle, I gave you 10.
- I only pay for pussy with profits.
- I thought you never lose.
- It's not a loss till we leave.
- I'll win it back.
Don't worry.
- I'm worried, Vin.
If you want out...
And miss out when you go on a million-dollar run?
No way.
- All right.
- Blow off this stripper thing.
- No, it'll be fun.
- It will be.
- We gotta be at the pool in five minutes.
- Let's do it.
Fuck the pool, let's win our money back.
You don't care if he judges a stripper contest?
Which is worse for his image?
That he judges a stripper contest, or he loses thousands?
- Table's not going anywhere, calm down.
- Hey, yo, E!
Did you tell Sloan I said, "What up"?
- No, Seth.
- Why not?
Because it was like a half an hour ago.
- It's just a call.
Make the call, say, "what up".
- Yeah, E. Make the call, say, "What up".
So he's saying he fucked my girlfriend?
- I don't know, E.
- It's hard to say.
It's not hard.
Seth Green landed on Plymouth Rock before you did, E. Wake up.
- No shot.
- Can we please go and win some money?
The strippers aren't here yet.
E, it could've been years ago.
The guy's been in Hollywood since he was like 12.
And Sloan does like her men petite.
- I know every guy she's been with.
- How?
- You made a list?
- Yeah.
Couples make lists.
- You wouldn't know that for obvious reasons.
- Where the fuck are these girls?
- You and your wife made lists?
- I'm the only one on it.
Yeah, right.
Look, E, I don't wanna rile you up, but I've done the list thing.
- Did you hand over a hard drive, Vin?
- It was big.
But I did leave some off.
So you're saying Sloan left Seth Green off the list?
I think everybody leaves someone off the list.
Except you.
- I'm calling.
- Ain't you gonna call your wife, Ari?
I don't care if my wife's getting fucked right now, Turtle, I need to get my money back!
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello.
I'm Joanne, but I go by the stage name of Cheyenne.
I understand you're judging the contest.
What can I do to get you to vote for me?
Yeah, Vince, what's a girl gotta do to get a vote?
- Vince, we'll be here all day.
- Due to circumstances beyond my control...
Me!
I have to go.
But talk to my boy, Turtle.
He's the eyes, mouth and ears of this operation.
- Enjoy.
- The commission, now this?
It's Christmas.
- Hi, Turtle.
- How you doin'?
So you're really his eyes and ears?
Ken, whatever happened to that pretty little Filipino girlfriend of yours, Annie?
Sore subject.
She just moved out a week ago.
Fuck her.
Hands like yours, her loss.
- Still hurts.
- Yeah, I hear you, Ken.
You know what?
Johnny Drama's got just the cure for your heartbreak.
Really?
What's that?
Boys' night out.
Just a good steak, nice bottle of red, couple cigars and some good conversation.
You do that, Ken, and you'll forget all about women in no time.
I don't usually go out socially with clients, Johnny.
Ken, I'd like to think after all this time you see me as more than just a client.
- Oh, Eric.
He's so annoying.
- Annoying how?
We were on a teen tour together, and he was obsessed with me for the entire trip.
- But you never dated him?
- No, Eric, I never dated him.
This is a tough competition, girls, and what with a $25,000 prize, everybody needs an edge.
Fortunately for you, I left my integrity back in Los Angeles.
My vote is 100% for sale.
Hit me.
Jesus!
What the fuck are you smirking about?
Where are you going?
- You can't force the cards.
- How much are we down?
110.
Each.
Jesus!
- We'll get it back after dinner.
- I'm not hungry, Vinnie.
You take the reins, maybe you'll have better luck.
Don't go too crazy, I don't wanna lose more than 500 grand.
Bring it.
Bring it!
So you talked to her and she said nothing happened?
- Right.
- Why's he making out something did?
- Cos he's a jerk-off.
- Why are you so calm?
The old E would not have been able to control himself.
The old E, "Mad Dog" E, woulda bit Seth Green's ear off.
- I'm a grown man.
I don't fight any more.
- Way to be mature.
You're entering your latter years gracefully.
Speaking of latter years...
Fuck off, E.
How relaxed do I look?
You look like you died in 1983.
Wait till you see me after a shower, I'm gonna sparkle like the 4th of July.
Wait till dinner.
I got ten of the best strippers in town joining us.
Strippers?
Why?
- Shouldn't it be, "Strippers?
Thank you"?
- Thank you.
We don't want girls at the table tonight.
I'm trying to keep this trip free of distractions.
- We?
Who's "we"?
- Ken.
He's gonna be joining us tonight.
You don't want strippers at dinner cos your gay masseuse is joining us?
I'm really starting to worry about you, Drama.
Please, Turtle, Ken is not gay.
In fact, if I release him on the strippers tonight, you're gonna be shit out of luck.
Please.
Bring it on.
So, have you seen Brokeback Mountain, Kenneth?
Nah.
I don't get to the movies.
- When I'm not working, I'm usually training.
- For what?
It's probably too late for me, but I still dream of the NFL.
- You play ball?
- Ken was a superstar at U of A.
I don't know about superstar.
Oh, yes.
Yes, you were.
And a second-round draft pick for the San Diego Chargers.
Went 74 yards and three receptions in his first NFL quarter, then blew out his knee.
Fucking AstroTurf.
That sucks, man.
- You really do remember everything, Johnny.
- Elephant brain.
Turtle, girls.
Watch this.
- Hey, Shelby.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Crystal.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Tiffany.
- Hi, sweetie.
- This is Bunny.
And Minx.
- Hey, Turtle.
Yo, E, be cool.
I'm cool, Vince.
I'm totally cool.
What do ya got?
Come on.
Show me a little love.
What do ya think?
Fuck!
Can I have another marker?
Please?
This is Mount Kilimanjaro, one of the tallest mountains on earth and it's freezing.
So I say to this girl,
"I'd be happy to give up my canteen for you,
"but what are you gonna give up for me?"
Fantastic.
I gotta hit the head.
I'll be right back.
So?
- I love him.
- I told you.
Let's hit the bar.
Maybe I should check on Ari, see how he's doing.
- He can't be doing any worse than you.
- Oh, it's Vinnie Chase and the chasers!
Hey, let me get a couple more Jager shots for the boys from Queens.
- No, thanks.
- You don't drink?
Seth, I stopped drinking Jager in high school.
But listen, I told Sloan you said, "What up".
- What did she say?
- She said, "What up".
- That's all?
- That's all.
All right.
All right.
You tell her I said, "What up" back.
Yeah, man.
Don't forget to tell her he said, "What up" back.
- What is it with them?
They're like retards.
- Yeah, but you were calm.
But is it gonna last, E?
Or are we doing battle?
We're not doin' battle.
It ain't gonna happen.
All right.
All this testosterone has put a kink in my neck.
I'll have to get Ken to work that out.
Better hurry up, Drama, he's working one out right now.
Christ almighty.
That's Amber.
Promised me three days in her father's cabin in Montana if she wins.
Turtle, I can't pick someone cos she promised to fuck you.
I don't care who wins.
I cut deals with all of 'em.
Sweetheart, this guy's with me tonight.
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to relax before the competition.
Sorry, sister, I got my own problems.
Fuck you!
I'm feeling good, Ari.
Let me sit.
- How much we down?
- 200 and fuckin' 70!
We can get that back.
- You'll get thrown out, calm down.
- He's a little upset.
I'll take another marker for 100,000, please.
Thanks, Sam.
So, Ken, did you get to sample those almonds?
They were terrific, John.
Brought me back to my childhood.
- Yeah, I knew you'd appreciate 'em.
- Oh, crap.
- They must have closed shop early tonight.
- Oh, no.
How about we meet in the morning?
There's no way I can sleep without a rubdown.
Let's take it back to my room.
- Split 'em.
- How much is that?
- 75 grand.
- Now 150.
Gotta do it.
Split 'em again.
I once saw a guy split six times straight.
- No choice.
Double down.
- Vinnie, that's 300 grand.
- We'll win it back.
- Or my kids go to community college.
I'll take this hand myself if you want.
- Sorry.
- It's OK.
I'd like to split these, please.
- Split kings?
- What's it to you?
- I don't want you fucking up my cards.
- Sir, you have to let him play his way.
- He's playing like a idiot!
- Sir...
- Ari, calm down.
- Relax.
You'll get thrown out of the casino with 300,000 on the table.
Calm down.
- Looks like I knew what I was doing.
- No, you took her break card.
Dealer has 11.
Looks like she would've had 21.
I think an apology is in order.
Shoot me and put me out of my fucking misery.
If only it weren't a crime.
Ari, remain positive.
Summon the cards you desire.
Get a higher power from above.
Come on!
- Can't hurt to try.
- Please, God, give us a 10!
Am I getting that apology?
You know what, man?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Give it to me.
You know, I don't have my table or anything, Johnny.
That's OK.
We can just use the bed, right?
- I guess.
- Cool, I'll go get changed.
Oh, Ken, I got a nice pineapple-coconut-aloe-vera gel.
Is that cool?
What the fuck are you doing, Ken?
Johnny, I have never thought about a man...
in that way.
But the adoration you poured on me today has made me feel that if... this is something that you need...
Fuck it, it is Vegas!
Looks like they started already.
No, this is just the pre-show.
We should have a post-show in the suite.
What do you say, Turtle?
I already ordered four bottles of Cristal and 400 strawberries.
Does money won feel better than money earned, or am I nuts?
You're nuts.
It's the "We don't drink Jager" crew!
What up, E?
This fucking guy, man.
Did you tell Sloan I said, "What up" again?
No, Seth, I think one time was all she needed.
- What's that mean?
- She said you were obsessed with her.
She doesn't need to feel like you still are.
- She said I was obsessed with her?
- Yeah, sorry.
No, that's OK.
No apologies necessary.
In reality, it's more like...
she was obsessed with this.
You know what?
Keep fucking dreaming, Seth.
I must have been dreaming about how I blasted her in the face like a Jackson Pollock.
You got a problem?
- Get your fucking hand off me, man.
- No, but I do!
This ought to be good for your image, Vince.
English
VEGAS BABY, VEGAS!
So they're just gonna give him 100 grand?
Cash, in a bag, that's correct.
Just to show up to a party?
Just to show up.
You don't even have to smile, Vin.
- Only in America.
- No, only in Vegas.
So what do you say, E?
Should we go?
Well, seeing that you told the Hollywood Foreign Press that the whole town is a bunch of dickheads,
I don't think anybody's gonna miss us.
So, what you're saying is, we should go.
Have I ever said no to Vegas?
Be like saying no to a blowjob.
What do you say, Johnny?
Vegas?
Uh, love to, bro, but I'm shooting my pilot on the 30th.
- I gotta stay rested.
- You're turning down Vegas, Drama?
I'm gonna be turning down a lot of things, Turtle, now that I'm a working actor.
Better get used to it.
You know, Johnny, there are many different Vegases.
You could go and just spot.
Don't you have that masseuse you love over there?
Oh, yeah, Ken at the Hard Rock.
He's got hands of gold.

- Oh... be happy to.
Vin, this is not the time to go to Vegas.
You've got a serious public image problem right now.
That's why I'm going, Ari.
Hoping by the time I get back, everyone will have forgotten about it.
Come on, Vinny, listen, we need to get you a job.
- You read any of those scripts?
- I brought 'em with.
Thought you might read 'em to me.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we could use a chaperone.
- Help keep us out of trouble.
- I'm not going to Vegas on a Wednesday.
- Come on, what else you got to do?
- I have the theater with the wife and her mother tonight.
Move over, I'm in.
Nice relaxing Wednesday may be just what I need.
Vegas, baby, Vegas!
I'm sorry, baby, you know I'd rather be at "Menopause, The Musical" tonight than here, but I got kidnapped!
- It's true!
- You see that, baby?
- Will you sign this?
- I'm sorry, honey--
- Hello?
Hello?
- Is she mad?
She said she'd rather see me gagged and bound like a real kidnappee, yeah, so I think so.
Oh, all right, here comes the apology.
Hey, baby.
I put $6 million into this company and find out at the staff meeting that you're at the roulette table?
- Oh, hey, Babs, how are ya?
- What the fuck are you doing, Ari?
I'm taking care of a high-priority client, that's what I'm doing.
You have 150 clients to keep happy, now.
Barbara--
You need to manage your time more efficiently.
- You're not my mother, Babs.
- Fuck you, Ari.
See, my mother would never speak to me that way.
I hate women!
Not all women.
Who's got five?
Ready and waiting, bro.
What's this?
Tradition.
When we were kids, we'd hit AC, we'd put five bucks on red.
We win, we knew it'd be a good weekend.
- What if you lose?
- Vince never loses.
Five on red.
Come on!
Red 16.
- It's gonna be a good weekend.
- Keep the change, bro.
Hey, Vinny, what do you say we go halves?
We'll do like a gambling partnership.
- Okay, Ari, you're on.
- All right.
- Hey!
Vinny Chase.
- Seth.
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?
You here for that thing at Body English tonight?
- Yeah.
- Cool, yeah, me too.
It should be fun.
I brought my whole crew out.
Definitely.
You know Ari Gold, my agent?
Never met, big fan.
That's funny dude.
That pinky bought me a house in Malibu.
Malibu!
And I think you know E.
How you doing, Seth?
Good to see you again.
How you doing, man?
How'd that thing work out for you at the hotel?
Like I said, it wasn't what it looked like.
Like I said, it never is.
So, how's Sloan, man?
She's still good, Seth.
Cool, hey, do me a favor.
Tell her I said "what up," okay?
Yeah, I will.
I'll tell her that.
- All right.
See ya.
- See ya.
- What's up, Seth?
- Oh, Johnny Drama.
- How you doing, man?
- Did you hear about my pilot?
- No!
Congratulations!
- Thanks, bro.
Good for you, man!
You could use the work.
What the fuck is up with this guy?
Every time I see him, he asks me about Sloan and he's got a shit-eating grin on his face.
Don't get all panicky, E.
Seriously, E, you'd be jealous if he said they were cousins.
- What does that mean?
- It means you're a jealous guy.
- Always have been.
- Bullshit.
Face it E, you're like Eric Roberts in "Star 80."
How would you know?
- I've heard stories.
- Yeah?
Name one example.
Andy Abetemarco, 10th grade.
You punched him in the head just because he got assigned to be Audrey Polini's lab partner.
There's more to that story, Turtle, he stole her frog.
- Hey, you know they got married?
- Really?
No, but see, you're still jealous.
- Whatever.
- Whatever, exactly.
- I don't think Seth meant anything.
- All right.
Nice room, Turtle.
Hey, boys, fruit's all green.
Whoa, easy with that, Ari.
It's from Body English.
Ah!
100k, Vince.
Nice.
Hey Vinny, who'd you have to fuck to get that?
No fucking, Ari.
I just have to go to a party.
Not according to this itinerary.
Says you also gotta be at a pool event this afternoon and then drinks with the contestants tonight.
Contestants?
Yeah, says you're judging a beauty contest.
- Queen of the Strip.
- Sounds like a bonus.
Sounds like I don't know what you got us into as usual.
So far it all looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Yeah, we'll see about that.
I'm gonna go check it out.
I'm comin' with you.
Hey, Vinny, go win us some money.
God damn, I feel at ease.
I'm out.
You brought your own robe?
Why wouldn't I?
- Mind if we join you?
- Sure.
- I'll take some chips, please.
- All of it?
- Well, 10 is yours, do what you want.
- Really?
Yeah, man.
Commission.
You earned it.
Thank you, Vince!
You-
- You booked him into this?
- Turtle did.
- Nice job managing.
This should be great for his image.
What are you doing?
I'm on vay-cay.
Getting a cocktail.
All right.
What are we drinking?
- Johnny!
- Hey, Ken!
- It's been a while.
- How are ya, buddy?
Good to see ya.
You look great.
You look great.
I lost a couple pounds.
- Yeah, it shows.

California almonds.
I remember last time I was in town you said you couldn't find a decent almond in the desert, so I thought, well...
Wow.
I can't believe you remembered.
That's really thoughtful.
I got an elephant's brain, Ken.
I remember everything.
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it,
I'm stressed like a motherfucker.
A little of that, a little of this, some of that...
All right, come on, baby!
Come on!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
He should just cancel this.
Definitely.
- He's up 2500.
- Oh yeah?
That means I'm up 1250.
Drinks are on me, E.
- One more for the road?
- Definitely.
Oh Ken, you have not lost your touch.
All these compliments are gonna make me insecure.
Well don't be.
You've got the gift.
- No doubt.
- Thanks.
In fact, I'd like to lock you down for the rest of the day.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
I'll double your rate.
'Cause I don't want these hands touching anyone but me.
Ooh...
Hit me.
- Sorry, sir.
- Hey, you can't stay hot forever.
- Hit.
- Ah, but Turtle can!
Hey, jerkoff, you signed him up
- to judge a stripper contest.
- Really?
- Titties?
- It's a stripper contest.
- Nice.
- Vin, you should cancel.
- I agree.
- Can't cancel.
Yeah, you can.
You didn't sign anything.
- Just give the money back.
- Money's gone, E.
- What are you talking about?
- I hit a little cold streak.
You lost 100 grand?
- Something like that.
- But we're partners.
Oh, shit, I forgot.
Means I'm only really down 50.
Shoulda partnered up with me, Ari.
I'm up 1200.
I get to two grand,
I'm keeping it stashed to buy me a high class ho.
But Turtle, I already gave you 10.
I only pay for pussy with profits.
I thought you never lose, Vin.
It's not a loss till we leave Nevada.
- I'll win it back.
Don't you worry.
- I'm worried, Vin.
- I'm worried!
- If you want out, cut your losses--
What, and miss the boat when you go on a million dollar run?
- No way, count me in.
- All right.
Vince, you gotta blow off this stripper thing, man.
- No, let's go, it'll be fun.
- It will be.
And we gotta be at the pool for the meet-and-greet in five minutes.
- That'll definitely be fun.
- Let's do it.
Fuck the pool, let's win our money back.
You don't care about him judging a stripper contest, Ari?
Which is worse for his image?
That he judges a stripper contest, or he loses a couple hundred thousand at the fucking tables?
Table's not going anywhere, calm down.
Hey, yo, E!
Hey, did you tell Sloan I said "what up"?
- No, Seth.
- Why not?
Because it was like a half an hour ago.
It's just a phone call, man.
Make the call.
- Say "what up."
- Yeah, E.
Make the call, say "what up."
So this dickhead is saying what, that he fucked my girlfriend?
I don't know, E.
It's hard to say what he was saying.
It's not hard to say.
Seth Green landed on Plymouth Rock
- before you did, E. Wake up.
- No shot.
I'm so not interested in this!
Can we please go out there and win some money?
- Please, Vinny!
- The strippers aren't even here yet.
Look, E, it could've been years ago.
The guy's been running around Hollywood since he was like 12.
And Sloan does like her men petite.
Fuck that.
I know every guy she's been with.
How?
- What, did you make a list?
- Yeah, Turtle.
Couples make lists.
You wouldn't know that for obvious reasons.
Where the fuck are these girls!
Somebody...
What Ari, you and your wife didn't make lists?
- We did.
I'm the only one on it.
- Yeah, right.
Look E, I don't wanna rile you up, but I've done the list thing.
What, did you hand over a hard drive, Vin?
It was big but I did leave some off.
Everyone does.
So what, you're saying that-- that Sloan left Seth Green off the list?
I think everybody leaves someone off the list.
Except you.
I'm calling.
Ain't you gonna call your wife, Ari?
I don't care if my wife's getting fucked right now, Turtle,
I need to get my money back!
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello.
I'm Joanne, but I go by the stage name of Cheyenne.
I understand you're judging the contest.
Is there anything I can do to get you to vote for me?
Yeah, Vince, what's a girl gotta do to get a vote around here?
Come on, Vince, we're gonna get stuck here all day.
Let's go.
Girls, due to circumstances beyond my control--
Me!
- I have to go.
- But talk to my boy, Turtle, here.
He's the eyes, mouth and ears of this operation.
- Enjoy.
- First, the commission, now this?
This is like Christmas.
- Hi, Turtle.
- How you doin'?
So you're really his eyes and ears?
Ken, whatever happened to that pretty little
Filipino girlfriend of yours, Annie?
Sore subject.
She just moved out a week ago.
Fuck her.
Hands like yours...
her loss.
- Still hurts.
- Yeah, I hear you, Ken.
You know what?
Johnny Drama's got just the cure for your heartbreak.
Really?
What's that?
Boys' night out.
Just a good steak, nice bottle of red, couple cigars and some good conversation.
You do that, Ken, and you'll forget all about women in no time.
I don't usually go out socially with clients, Johnny.
Ken, I'd like to think after all this time you look at me as more than just a client.
Oh, Eric.
He's so annoying.
Annoying how?
We we on a teen tour together, and he was obsessed with me for like the entire trip.
- But you never dated him?
- No, Eric, I never dated him.
This is a tough competition, girls, and what, with $25,000 prize, everybody needs an edge.
Fortunately for you,
I left my integrity back in Los Angeles.
My vote is 100% for sale.
Hit me.
Jesus!
What the fuck are you smirking about?
Huh?
Where are you going?
Oh, I'm not feeling it right now.
You can't force the cards.
- How much are we down?
- Uh, 110.
Each.
Jesus!
- We'll get it back after dinner.
- I'm not hungry, Vinny.
You take the reins, maybe you'll have better luck.
Don't go too crazy, I don't wanna lose more than 500 grand.
Bring it.
Bring it!
So you talked to her,
- and she said nothing happened?
- Right.
Why's he trying to make it like something did?
'Cause he's a jerkoff.
- Why are you so calm?
- The old E would not have been able to control himself.
The old E, "Mad Dog" E, woulda bit Seth Green's ear off.
Guys, I'm a grown man.
I don't fight anymore.
Oh, way to be mature.
Yeah, you're really entering your latter years gracefully.
Speaking of latter years...
Fuck off, E.
How relaxed do I look?
Mmm, you look like you died in 1983.
Wait till you see me after a shower,
I'm gonna sparkle like the 4th of July.
Wait till you see dinner.
I got 10 of the best strippers in town
- joining us tonight.
- Ooh!
Strippers?
Why?
Now, shouldn't it be, strippers, how
- and thank you?
- Thank you.
Look, we don't want girls at the table tonight.
I'm just trying to keep this trip free of distractions.
We?
Who's we?
Ken.
He's gonna be joining us tonight.
You don't want strippers at dinner 'cause your gay masseuse is joining us?
I'm really starting to worry about you, Drama.
Oh please, Turtle, Ken is not gay.
In fact, if I release him on the strippers tonight, you're gonna be shit out of luck.
Oh, please.
Bring it on.
So, have you seen "Brokeback Mountain," Kenneth?
Nah.
I don't get to the movies.
When I'm not working, I'm usually training.
- Training for what?
- Well, it's probably too late for me, but I still dream of the NFL.
- You play ball?
- Ken was a superstar at U of A.
I don't know about superstar.
Oh, yes.
Yes you were.
And a second-round draft pick for the San Diego Chargers.
Went 74 yards and three receptions in his first NFL quarter, then blew out his knee.
Fucking AstroTurf.
That sucks, man.
You really do remember everything, Johnny.
- Elephant brain.
- Turtle, girls.
Watch this.
- Hey, Shelby.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Crystal.
- Hi, Turtle.
- Tiffany.
- Hi, sweetie.
- This is Bunny.
- Hey, Turtle.
And Minx.
Yo, E, be cool.
I'm cool, Vince.
I'm totally cool.
What do ya got, what do ya got?
Come on, come on.
Show me a little love, little love, little love.
What do ya think-- Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Can I have another marker?
Please?
Please...
This is Mt.
Kilimanjaro, one of the tallest mountains on earth and it's freezing.
So I say to this girl,
"I'd be happy to give up my canteen for you, but what are you gonna give up for me?"
Fantastic.
Oh, Ken.
I gotta hit the head.
I'll be right back.
So?
- I love him.
- I told you.
Let's hit the bar.
Maybe I should check on Ari, see how he's doing.
He can't be doing any worse than you.
Oh, it's Vinny Chase and the Chasers!
Hey, let me get a couple more Jager shots
- for the boys from Queens over there.
- No thanks.
What's the matter, you don't drink, Eric?
I drink vodka, Seth.
I stopped drinking Jager in high school.
Oh!
But listen, I told Sloan you said "what up."
Mmm.
What'd she say?
She said "what up."
- That's all?
- That's all.
All right.
All right.
You tell her I said "what up" back.
Yeah, man.
Don't forget to tell her he said "what up" back.
What is wrong with these guys?
They're like retards.
Yeah, but you were calm.
Yeah, but is it gonna last though, E?
Or are we doing battle?
We're not doin' battle, Drama.
It ain't gonna happen.
All right.
All this testosterone has put a kink in my neck.
I'm gonna have to get Ken to work that out.
Better hurry up, Drama, looks like he's working one out right now.
Christ almighty.
Oh, that's Amber.
Country girl, promised me three days in her father's cabin in Montana if she wins.
Turtle, I know it's a stripper contest, but I can't pick someone 'cause she promised to fuck you.
I don't care who wins.
I cut deals with all of 'em.
Uh, sweetheart, this guy's with me tonight.
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to relax before the competition.
Sorry, sister, I got my own problems.
Fuck you!
- I'm feeling good, Ari.
Let me sit.
- Ari, relax.
- How much we down?
- 200 and fuckin' 70!
We can get that back.
You're gonna get thrown outta here, calm down.
He's a little upset.
I'll take another marker for 100,000 please.
Thanks, Sam.
So, Ken, did you get to sample those almonds I gave you?
Oh, they were terrific, John.
Brought me right back to my childhood.
Yeah, I knew you'd appreciate 'em.
Oh, crap.
They must have closed shop early tonight.
Oh, no, no, no--
How 'bout we just reconvene in the morning?
No, no.
There's no way I can sleep without a rubdown.
Let's take it back to my room, huh?
Uh...
yeah... okay.
- Split 'em.
- How much is that?
- 75 grand.
- Now 150.
Gotta do it.
Split 'em again.
I once saw a guy split six times straight.
No choice.
Double down.
Vinny, that's 300 grand.
We're gonna win it all back on this hand.
Yeah, or my kids are going to community college.
I'll take this hand myself if you want.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
I'd like to split these please.
- You're gonna split kings?
- Yeah.
What's it to you?
I got 150 grand on this hand, I don't want you fucking up my cards.
Sir, you have to let him play his way.
- He's playing like a fucking idiot!
- Sir...
Ari, calm down.
Ari, relax.
You're gonna get thrown out of the casino with 300,000 on the table.
- Calm down--
- We'll take care of it later, Ari.
Looks like I knew what I was doing, huh?
No, it looks like you took her break card.
Dealer has 11.
Looks like she would've had 21.
I think an apology is in order.
Oh!
Somebody shoot me and put me out of my fucking misery.
If only it weren't a crime.
Ari, remain positive.
Summon the cards you desire.
Get a higher power from above.
Come on!
Can't hurt to try.
Please, God, give us another 10!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Am I getting that apology?
You know what, man?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Give it to me.
You know, I don't have my table or anything, Johnny.
That's okay.
We can just use the bed, right?
- I guess.
- Cool, I'll go get changed.
Oh, hey, Ken, I got a nice pineapple-coconut-aloe-vera gel.
Is that cool?
What the fuck are you doing, Ken?
Johnny, I have never thought about a man...
in that way.
But the adoration you have poured on me today has made me feel that if... this is something that you need, fuck it...
It is Vegas!
Johnny!
Looks like they started already.
No, this is just the pre-show.
Well, now that we're up 100 grand, we should have a post-show up in the suite.
What do you say, Turtle?
I already ordered four bottles of Cristal and 400 chocolate-covered strawberries.
Nice.
Does money won feel better than money earned,
- or am I nuts?
- You're nuts.
Oh!
It's the "we don't drink Jager" crew!
What up, E?
This fucking guy, man.
Hey, did you tell Sloan I said "what up" again?
No, Seth, I think one time was all she needed.
What's that mean?
It means she said you used to be obsessed with her.
I don't think she needs to feel like you're still obsessed with her.
- She said I was obsessed with her?
- Yeah, sorry to say.
No, that's all right.
No apologies necessary.
I mean, in reality, it's more like... she was obsessed with this.
Hey, you know what?
Keep fucking dreaming, Seth.
- Keep dreaming.
- Oh, you're right.
I must have been dreaming about how I blasted her in the face like a Jackson Pollock.
You got a problem?
- Get your fucking hand off me, man.
- No, but I do!
This ought to be good for your image, Vince.
At that speed, your will bump me.
NO, just like i said.
Awesome.
Awesome.
You handled very good at that condition.
- It is not you.
Eh?
- Do you know someone that ride a black car?
A black car?
It is not me?
- One that's faster than you.
There are none in this area.
- It's that so?
But, wait a minute.
Please teach me how to drift.
- I reject.
But, please wait.
I am the black car rider.
Please, teach me how to drift.
How's things?
- Nothing.
As I suspected.
Not even a clue?
- Yeah.
Who's there?
Who else if it isn't me?
...your first student.
- You...!
Do you know him?
- The one that I overtake at Otomezaka.
I completely lost.
- Go home.
Do you don't want to know?
The story about the black car?
- Where?
Where is he?
Shinichi!
If you don't punch, I will tell you.
What type?
- It is FC.
It is fast?
- That person is been called 'black shooting star'.
Of course he's fast.
If I knock him down?
What the hell is he thinking?
What is going on?
It is better if you not buzzing around people's affair.
- Eh?
Who's that?
- a red '13'.
Hey.
Who is this FC?
It is yours?
- Nope.
It is mine.
What do you want?
I want you to race with me.
- Huh, what the hell you thinking?
What is your name?
- Red Lightning.
So, it is you.
Silvia 13, it is strong.
With low suspension and powerful torque.
But even this car compared to my FC, the result is predictable.
Answer me.
This place is my place.
Do you want to race, or not?
Alright.
I take your challenge.
But, ...if you lose, can you promise not to show your face here again?
OK.
Alright.
Let's do it.
Awesome.
Professional showdown like Ushida Shironuki's, ...rarely can be seen.
- Yeah, you right.
Hey!
Please let me see how you drive.
I won't disturb you.
Please...
You, just think what're you doing?
- Mina,
Eh?
It's alright.
Just let he do whatever he likes.
Really?
Thank you.
I don't want to know if something happen.
The finish line is after the bridge downhill, alright?
Can you stick to me?
What a very smooth shift control.
A perfect footwork, ...at human's pace, how can he react this fast?
we will crash!
what the hell is that?
I think that we definitely crashing...?
that means that he is in full control?
what a nerve!
Is he not scared?
if we hit that rail?
how he can drive like this?
Fantastic!
At that narrow corner he even use faint to stay in course.
Although the distance is increasing in straight line, ...but in low-speed corner, we are definately closing to FC.
because of the difference of machines, that FC will ...adding the distance.
if this continue, we will lose.
but, what if he have another tactic?
FC is the leading and the distance is closing?
Really?
It is almost at the downhill.
At downhill, ...the gap will be wider.
Even if you call it a close match, huh?
- Yeah.
He not gonna stick anymore,
Red Lightning, whatever.
you will not win over me.
What?
!
Amazing!
How he can turn so fast in downhill corner?
This person didn't even realize how miraculous that is?
That downhill speed!
he didn't want to live or what?
He perfectly seize it, but... the problem begins here.
At this section, the road's width is very narrow.
If he want to over take at straight line, ...all the straight line is not long enough.
It is not long before the bridge, ...I will grab the victory!
From outline?
that's crazy!
Stupid!
You will not pass!
What!
It couldn't be?
It's that '13' victory.
Ushida-san lost?
Stupid.
That's imposibble.
Even he isn't the one?
He isn't?
What is this all about?
what's more important, are you allright?
- What?
You didn't scared?
- Why?
Why?
it is obvious, normally.
- Really?
what do you mean by really?
Do you scared when you walking?
- Eh?
That how it is.
I lost.
A driver that ride a black car, ...do you know someone else?
A black car?
Do you have grudge on black?
Huh...
I know two of that kind.
- Two?
Yeah.
One is an Empress of Chichiya Downhill Course, the one that use '90, the wild Yurika.
And the other one, ...appear out of nowhere 3 years before, ...and then disappear, ...a black chaser called Kurohyou.
- Where can I find them?
You can find Empress at Chichiya Downhill Course,
Where would you go if you want to find The Black Chaser?
Maybe he has retired?
- Really?
Hey!
This time we will build a new racing team and, ...if you care, would you want to join?
It's not just for the 'black one', you know.
You can compete with anyone.
- And you're saying?
Do you not feel excited at all?
- It's not I interested in racing.
You're not interested in racing?
- Yeah.
The Red...
Sensei, please wait.
Please teach me how to drift.
I don't have the technique.
- That again.
That perfect drift that almost kissing guard rail.
How did you see at that point?
It is impossible for you.
- Why?
Shinichi is a former of world-ranking boxer.
- Eh?
At that slippery moment, the visions is much more essential.
To Shinichi, every point of a car's angle, ...at that time, every angle that outside of eyes vision, ...every angle are precisely predicted.
- Oh, yeah.
In a place that as close as 1 meter, ...and closing in at a very high speed, ...of course you can't see the moving car slowly.
That is Shinichi's specialty.
Do you understand?
That's why for you it's impossible.
- Mina.
Don't say things that meaningless.
- I'm sorry. but this...
Awesome.
If you're was a boxer, that means, ...through boxing, I can be faster in street.
Whatever you say, it's still impossible.
The day after tomorrow, it will be Chichiya Downhill Course.
The settings I will leave it to you.
- Again, you have to use me?
I'm sorry.
- I'm fine.
What more important, you better rest a bit.
- OK.
Please wait a minute.
Wherever Sensei will go, ...I will go to.
What a very fast reflect.
Do you really want to be that fast?
- It is obvious for a racer, right?
Even if you disturbing other driver?
If their too scared, just don't drive at downhill road.
- What did you say?
- Wh, what're you doing?
Because of those that are like you,
- Eh?
Those that are like you...
- Sensei...
Don't ever, ...ever show your face again in front of me.
Drifting at a public road is a racer too, right?
What is so wrong if you want to be faster?
You're still here?
Sensei mad at me because I said that I want to be faster.
- Because he dislikes racer.
Then, why he races with other racer?
That's odd, right?
- Yup.
What's that means?
- There are other circumstances.
What is the circumstances?
By the way, ...why do you want to be faster?
- It is obvious of a racer, right?
You say that to Shinichi too?
- Yeah.
That's why he mad at you.
- Which means?
I'm also like that.
I hate those kind of person.
And that's why, ...please don't disturb us again?
Welcome home.
Papa has come home.
Want to show to Papa?
Mami-chan?
Papa, welcome home.
I'm home.
Look at this, Mami drew this.
Ohh, you drew Papa?
That is just like me.
You can't do that, Papa.
After training, you sweat a lot.
Do I smell bad?
Look, just go for a bath.
Alright.
Mama want to go to bring dinner.
Mami-chan just continue colour this picture, ok?
This much is ok, right?
Come here.
Look very delicious.
- Papa!
One, two, itadakimasu.
Mmm, delicious.
Delicious.
- Yeah, that is nice.
This...
- What is this?
Yesterday, it's our anniversary day.
- You remember...
Of course.
- Mind if I open it?
Yeah.
- Thank you...
Japan's Eastern and Western title, ...the one that helps me to archieved that,
...it is you and Mami.
- I don't deserve...
Because of you that always supporting behind my back...
Racer, huh?
Hehh, awesome.
What do you mean?
- Huh?
You are driving safely.
- I know.
Ahh, there you are.
You, what are you doing here?
Oi!
- Ahh, nice to meet you.
That's not what you should say.
- I...
I hear that he is coming here, that's why.
Ohh, you heard that too?
- Eh senior, you heard that too?
Yeah, that's right.
The Chichiya Empress versus The Red Lightning, ...just how this confrontation will be, right?
- That right.
But, ...are they really coming here?
Of course.
They absolutely will come.
- Really?
Well, that depends.
Hows this?
my '90?
This turbine is marvelous, right?
Hows that?
- It is really something.
That's awesome.
So that is The Chichiya Downhill Empress?
Oi, it's red '13.
- That's the guy.
the wild Yurika, that use '90 is here?
- That is me.
I want you to race with me.
I don't have a reason to accept that challange, right?
Of cource... neither to reject, right?
But, what would it means if there is no conditions for this challenge?
If you lose?
- I never think of it.
which means that you don't want to lose, right?
- I just don't want to think anything.
Really?
Then, what if I get that '13?
- I'm fine with that, ...if that make you want to race with me.
Then it is a decision.
It is okey?
- Sensei.
I come to support you.
What a stubborn person.
- Never give up.
That is my motto.
Do whatever you want.
Oi, who do you think will win?
- If comparing horse power, of course '90 the better one.
Whatever that gonna happen, she will win.
The finish line at the cornering series after the seventh tunnel's exit.
- Understood.
It have some power.
Such a nice car.
But, it is not worthy as my car.
Even it is a machine with tremendous power, ...but with precise control, even the driver is a woman, a high level of drive is possible.
This is how we race in this era.
Eventhough his skill is not bad, but...
I'm just too good.
Drifting is just throwing your car performance.
For a good car, ...you can cornering even if the tyre is not that slippery.
I will never understand.
- What?
With this speed, and the skillful hands, ...why he hate so much a racer?
And then, why he race with other racer?
It's complicated.
Eh?
Like I said, he is a former world-ranking boxer, remember?
But, with his current body, he can't appear in the ring ever again.
Means that?
He had an accident...
Accident?
- Incredible.
Right now they are, ...exiting the first tunnel with a very high speed.
What a race.
...because a racer that drives carelessly.
Because of that accident, his body can't accept the risk to boxing again.
- So that's why.
But that is not the whole story.
Because of that accident too, ...that person lost his most valuable persons.
And I feel that lost too.
Mina...
- Brother!
Me and Shinichi, ...because of that accident,
...will never forgive everyone that race at public road.
That's why Shinichi battle with other racer, ...and I be his mechanic, ...together we strangle in this weird world.
- And that black car...
Shinichi, in this 3 years... didn't get a glimpse of that car.
But all that he knew... that driver style of racing and the colour of that car is black.
So that's why he...
- That's why, he will never forgive a racer... that drift at a public road.
They have past the second tunnel.
The two is lining up.
We're already at the third tunnel.
You're fast, I acknowledged that.
But all that matters in a race... is not just the speed, the will of fight is also essential.
The Empress is still leading.
- It is almost at the fourth tunnel.
'90 will overtake here.
- Eh?
If we can give a pressure at this section, ...that leave us to the low-speed cornering battle.
Shinichi must be in a difficult position right now.
This is it!
If I keep this distance at cornering, maybe you will catch-up with my '90 power.
But in a straight line, that is a different story.
That is no way '13 will catch-up.
'90 has overtaked.
- It's is always after that tunnel.
I think that's it.
- Nope, I think he still will give a fight.
It is hopeless.
- You think so?
Eh?
But all that you said earlier?
- If you think, commonly.
But, there is another chance.
- Chance?
After the seventh tunnel exit, there is a series of low-speed cornering.
The hardest part of this course, ...just after the seventh tunnel, ...a continuous cornering pair.
It's impossible.
Whatever you do, it's impossible for your car.
Overtaking at this part of the course, ...what is he thinking?
Of course I, The Empress can't be defeated.
What is this?
He doesn't even know this course?
Oh, no!
We will crash to each other!
What a crazy driver!
What an unexpectable turn-out!
- That's amazing.
Just like I said, he will never give-up.
Just as I expected.
Brilliant.
What a reckless outline overtake.
What will happen if you bump to me?
That will never happened.
You're a woman.
There're limit to what you drive.
Just don't try that trick.
It is my lost.
You have calculated that approach?
It's not a big matter anyway.
But anyway, ...it is not you.
- That black car?
Hmm, there're another one, in the last 3 years?
Someone with a name Bokuto, that use a Chaser.
With a very violent style of driving, ...the so-called Kurohyou.
- Where can I go to find that one?
Hmm, even he comes out of nowhere... then he will disappear again, right?
Really?
But if you keep racing, maybe someday you will meet him.
For the one that remember the sensation of racing, he will always continue to race.
That is what a racer is.
Today's race,
I enjoyed it.
It's not that '90 too right?
Maybe, he will never appear again.
After you revive, what you plan to do?
That Kurohyou,
- Kurohyou?
Yeah.
That is what he called when he racing.
The one that disappear 3 years back.
- 3 years back?
Yeah.
If you want to stop, it's your choice.
I don't want to include Mina in this mess.
- Shinichi, ...you can't setting that car, right?
If not me, who will do it?
Besides... this is also my problems.
Who's there?
It's you again.
What you want?
You want to meet him, right?
The Kurohyou.
How'd you know?
Actually, he is my companion.
That Kurohyou.
Where is he?
- Shinichi!
Tomorrow morning, 3 o'clock.
Please come to Otomezaka Downhill Course.
Brother.
Where is that Kurohyou?
I didn't tell my name before, right?
It's Bokuto Kouji.
What?
So, it is you?
4WD GTO, right?
But the style is a bit different.
Well... you can say, originally a not well trained driver,
That's why...
I will forever regret that unforgettable event.
But... you have show your skill to me.
Don't talk so big.
Let's start.
Do you want to lead first?
Either way you like.
So, I start first.
Here I go.
Be careful.
Huh, here we go.
Undoubtedly, it's like a different person.
I remember... his style of driving...
I remembered.
That's right,
I'm the Chaser... the one that cause your family died in that accident.
I'm certain... you're the one... you're that make Mami...
It's just you, ...that I will never forgive.
How dredful!
Why he didn't even make a single mistake?
This is not right.
At this rate, I cannot win.
Oh no!
We will crash.
This is it.
Stand up!
- Shinichi!
Shinichi!
please stop.
It's him, It is him!
Don't do this.
I'm really, really sorry.
Please forgive me.
Then why did you ran?
You shouldn't run in that accident!
Say something, huh?
You really piss me off!
I, really want to ask for forgiveness.
That Kurohyou, have disappear from this world.
- What're you saying?
It's actually my brother.
He died after that accident.
- Your brother?
Yeah.
The real face of Kurohyou, it's not me.
He is my twin brother.
He died in a race.
Please forgive us.
Please, forgive us!
It's already finished, right?
What you want to do after this?
I don't have a plan.
But, ...whatever you do, I will follow you.
Do whatever you want

Ona coldandfretfulday October 1874, ayounggirlroseearlytojoinheraunt for breakfast, asshehaddoneeveryday for the last two months.
HernamewasMissSallyLockhart, andwithinan hourshe was goingto kill a man.
I'm sorry Mrs Rees, I overslept.
Aunt Caroline, Aunt Caroline.
How many times must I tell you Veronica?
Veronica is not my name.
You think I do not know my own niece?
You must consider me very stupid.
-Of course not.
- You were christened Veronica?
Yes.
But my father always called me Sally.
Sally is a servant's name.
And your father is dead.
A letter?
For you?
Whatever can it be?
"Sali beware of the seven blessings".
Marchbanks HELP YOU ?
Chattum beware darling"
-It is a private matter.
- Private?
Excuse me.
Oh, it's Miss.
Sally.
Is Mr. Selby here?
He's in the West India docks on business, but Mr. Higgs will look after you.
Yeah?
What you want?
Take Miss Lockhart up to Mr Higgs, and mind your manners.
- Hey, that's mine.
- Get on and do what you're told.
Forgive him, Miss He weren't caught young enough to tame
This way, miss.
Miss.
Lockhart to see you, Mr Higgs.
Miss Lockhart.
Your father was a tragic loss.
A terrible thing the Lavinia going down like that.
What are you hanging around for?
Well now my dear what can I do for you?
Mr. Higgs, what was the business that took my father to the East?
Hardly the thing to interest a young girl
Especially as one as pretty as you.
I assure you I am interested.
H was checking a cargo...
Meeting our agent in the East, Mr. Van Eeden.
It was all simply routine.
M Did my father ever mention a man named Marchbanks?
Marchbanks ...
There's a ships chandler in Rotherhithe called Marjoriebanks, but I don't recall Capt. Lockhart have anything to do with him.
Mr. Higgs ...
Have you ever heard of something called the seven blessings?
The seven blessings?
What you want from me?
I'm the wrong man ...
totally wrong.
Mr. Higgs?
Mr. Higgs!
Mr. Selby.
- I, I ...
- What the blazers are you doing here?
A bad business about your father.
We were talking.
He just ... fell.
What's the old fool done to himself now?
Dead as mutton.
What are you doing here anyway?
I just came to see my poor father's office.
Please.
No it go?
faint, are you?
- No.
You'd better wait in the porter's room.
You'll have to give a statement to the police.
Don't worry, I wont tell the police you killed the old Higgsy.
- I didn't kill him.
- Of course you killed him!
I was looking for keyhole.
He died of fright.
Struck dead on the spot with terror.
- Let's have a look at this letter of yours.
- Which letter?
Give me some credit and don't worry my ticker is in better nick than his.
Whatever bugger who wrote this wants to get himself some education.
Sally with "I"?
C-M-A-T-T-U-M.
Must mean Chatham in Kent.
Ain't you worked that out yet?
The name's Jim Taylor, bye the way..
I'll keep an eye out for you.
Miss.
Lockhart?
Shenevermeanttokill him, but she did.
thesameas if she'dtakenagun andshothim
Thatwasn'tall.
Withoutevenknowing, it she'd shaken the edge of a web
Andfaraway the spider at the heart of it had awoken.
I assure you Major Marchbank, the will is in order.
Sign as a witness, Mrs. Thorpe?
And the item in question?
Everything will be done as your client directs.
Mr. Blyth, let's cut to business shall we?
Mr. Marchbanks his word?
I beg your pardon Mrs. Holland?
Oh!
Hold on hold on...
Always forget my teeth indoors
Pure ivory.
Made out east 25 years ago.
Look at the workmanship!
When my husband was took with the cholera theses were going in the grave with him.
I whipped them out of his mouth before the shut the lid.
There's years of wear in them teeth I thought".
Mr. Blyth, what have you got for me?
Major Marchbanks agreed the terms as discussed
The ruby will be deposited with Hammond and Whitgrove bankers in Winchester Street.
All legal - is it?
The will was witnessed by myself and the major's housekeeper, Mrs. Thorpe.
She drinks, but the signature is perfectly valid.
My clerk will prepare your account.
Good day, Mrs. Holland.
Yes good day, Good day, Mr. Blyth.
Next time make sure the pot is fresh.
The last girl served me stewed tea once too often.
And you know what happened to her.
Get out!
"City Man's sudden death heart attack blamed"
Theonlywitnesstothis sadevent wasmissVeronicaLockhart.
daughterofthelateCaptainLockhart, whoseowndeathinthewreck ofthe Lavinia wasreportedin thesepages last January.
You must have had some education Veronica?
Surely you can sew or play the piano forte?
What books have you read?
None that I can recall immediately.
Well, what accomplishments do you have?
Look, Ellen, Miss.
Lockhart is endeavouring to communicate through means of thought alone.
I am supposed to understand her without the intervention of language.
I'm afraid I have no accomplishments
So even the modest goal of governess is barred to you?
I am surprised you father should leave you so unprepared for the world.
He taught how to fire a pistol and speak Hindustani
He said I had the best head for figures of anyone he knew.
I can read an accounts ledger as easily as a newspaper.
Possibly one of my friends could in charity can find room for a ladies companion.
Excuse me I'm looking for Foreland House.
'Morning.
You are the second person to ask me that in the past half hour.
Its just over there beyond the trees.
Mmm dismal - isn't it?
I'm experimenting with new combinations of chemicals to find something more sensitive to record in this high contrast.
Something better than sodium you mean?
I must be dreaming!
A perfect beauty with knowledge of photography?
My father was interested the subject.
Frederick Garland.
Photographic "Artist".
Major Marchbanks?
Come with me, quickly!
You are Veronica?
- Lockhart?
- Sally.
My father always called me Sally.
Did he?
a very pretty name.
Your letter said it was urgent.
- Know something about the Seven Blessings ?
The?
- Seven Blessings?
Never heard of that.
That's not why I asked you here
Your life is in danger.
I have a deadly enemy.
That enemy is now yours too.
It is in the house as we speak.
This will explain everything.
What it contains will shock you very deeply
I wish I could protect you from the truth but I cannot.
She's calling for you sir.
Who is this enemy?
Why does she hate me?
Tell me her name, at least.
Mrs. Holland, her name is Mrs. Holland.
You have no idea how dangerous she is.
For god's sake
Get away from here as quickly as you can.
How beautiful you are!
Forgive me.
Not very gentlemanly major leaving a lady on here own
You never was much of a gentleman.
I was that put out when I Blyth told me you were trying to welch on our deal.
I come all the way down here to the bloody seaside.
Which I hate.
ain't you sorry to put me to so much trouble?
Your too late.
You'll never get hold of the ruby now.
You signed the will fair and square.
Your lawyer was a charlatan.
The will was riddled with errors.
No judge will take it seriously.
I want that ruby.
Its mine by right.
Its gone and you'll never find it.
It is over, Mrs. Holland.
You've taken everything I have.
But now, I have finally defeated you.
Well...
Up to a point, dear.
Don't scream, Mrs. Thorpe.
I do abominate loud noises.
There was a young here.
Her name was Lockhart, Sally Lockhart.
- Lockhart?
- The major gave her something.
A bag.
If you hurry, you'll still catch her.
I'm being followed.
It has an old just behind me.
She is very dangerous.
In here.
Don't move or you'll knock something over.
Don't say a word - she's coming.
You seen a young lady pass this way sir?
Dressed in mourning clothes.
A young lady?
You mean that remarkably pretty blond girl?
Trust a handsome young gentleman like yourself to notice-Yes
She's the one bless her..
She asked for directions to The Swan, she wanted the Ramsgate coach.
Ramsgate?
I see...
This Swan, where might that be sir?
left, right ... a few minutes walk and then right again.
You'd better hurry, the Ramsgate coach leaves in 5 minutes.
Thank you, sir.
I wont forget this.
Don't move.
All right - she's gone.
There was no need to flatter me.
I apologise i take it back.
Now, I see the light.
You are as ugly as she is.
So, what have you done to upset the hideous old witch?
I wish I knew.
- If you're frightened ...
- I'm not frightened.
No...
I don't believe you are.
You must let me pay for the use of your tent.
Not everything in life must be paid for.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I don't even know your name.
Lockhart.
Sally Lockhart.
All aboard!
London Bridge.
All stations for London Bridge.
All aboard!
In1856, afewmonthsbefore the outbreak of the Indian mutiny,
I,ArthurGeorgeMarchbanks,
Ihadtheoccasiontovisit the Maharajah of Agrapur, in company with my brother officers,
ColonelBrandon, Major Park and Capitan Lockhart.
Onthesecondevening of our visit, theMaharajah gave a banquet in our honour.
Ihaveneverwitnessed such splendour, butitpaledbycomparison with the magnificent Ruby of Agrapur.
I see the Ruby intrigues you, Major Marchbanks.
It was discovered in Burma six centuries ago.
and given in tribute to the princely house of Agrapur.
It is beautiful.
A fatal beauty alas, the cause of many deaths.
Only a few years ago it was stolen by a French adventurer.
who tried to escape detention by - err swallowing it.
My father had him torn open while still alive and plucked the stone, warm, from his belly.
Would you care to examine it?
Hold it close to the light and look inside.
Somethinginitsdepthandbeauty, itsbloodredliquidfire , fascinatedmebeyondall rulesof delicacy and good manners.
- Travelling alone miss?
- Yes.
I see.
You see nothing.
London Bridge ...
My book!
London Bridge ...
change for Waterloo.
Been at sea long?
- One year.
- What ship?
The Lavinia.
The Lavinia went down with all hands.
Come with me No1 smoke best in Limehouse.
"Lockhart Selby".
I have to find "Lockhart Selby".
You need to sleep, my friend.
Mrs. Holland's boarding house close by.
Clean bed very cheap.
I take you there.
Lifted it right out of here hands didn't I?
She didn't feel a thing.
Oh dear me I'd liked to have seen her face when she woke up.
Stuck up little thing!
- I showed here alright?
- A book.
Is that all?
Interesting is it?
Well, the young lady might find it fascinating.
If she were to read this it would be a first rate disaster.
Just as well she ain't got it then.
Do you like a nice story?
Mr. Hopkins?
Shall I read to you?
"I therefore withdrawn the ruby from the bank."
"this is the only chance I have of redeeming myself"
and I mean you to have it. "
"I hid it and to make doubly sure I shall conceal its hiding place in a cipher. "
"You will find the jewel ..."
Not much of an ending.
That's not the end -
There's a blazing' page missing!
and she's got it!
Now you go back and get it, and make sure she has a nasty accident
I ain't no killer Mrs. H.
Oh!
Didn't you know?
There was a stabbing Kent this morning
Only eye witness is in shock - poor soul.
Won't breath a word.
But one nod from me ... and she'll swear it was a smart young fellah in a check suit and bowler hat she saw standing over the body - with a knife in his hand.
You vicious old cow!
Charmed I'm sure.
Now, do we understand each other - or not?
I need opium!
I must have a pipe.
I must have a pipe!
If you do not get me one, the demons will kill me.
Another few days, you'll feel better
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at the state of me
You got a brother sir?
Yeh Nicholas.
He's my twin.
He's a man of the church.
You must find a girl called Sally Lockhart.
I have a message for her.
Mrs. Holland don't let me leave the house.
Her father was the Capitan Lockhart, of "Lockhart Selby".
Shipbuilders.
She's got spies everywhere.
She will know She knows everything.
No beggars here.
Go on clear off!
Miss Lockhart, please?
What you want her for?
Who is your lady love short arse?
Shut your bum and give your face a chance, Skidmore.
Who sent you?
She'll kill me if she finds out I'm here.
- Who?
- Mrs. Holland..
You'll be alright.
Just tell me what's up.
I got your message.
We can't stay here, somebody might see us.
Come on.
I come up here to the attic when I need a bit of time alone to think
Who is this Adelaide?
And the opium addict, Bedwell?
What does he know about the Seven Blessings?
He knows something alright and has a message for you.
He's down with some evil old cow called Mrs. Holland.
- Mrs. Holland.?
- You know her?
I know she wants to kill me.
- Where you been?
- Nowhere!
Nowhere is it?
I'll show you.
I will teach you to do not lie!
It will be the last lesson you ever learn.
I'm gonna cut you up and I'm gonna put you down there with the other one
- then you can keep each other company.
- No.
I could help it.
I'll tell you everything!
Don't put me there, please!
I only had time to read a few pages.
But it had something to do with my father, Marchbanks and a ruby.
But I do not see how any of it ties in
Marchbanks never heard of the Seven blessings
And Bedwell's never said nothing about a ruby.
Maybe there's two mysteries and they ain't connected?
But there is a connection - me.
You and Mrs. Holland it was her pinched your book.
No.
It was a man.
She clocked your photographer was winding her up, waited till you were asleep then nicked it.
- Or got this bloke to do it
- But what does she want the book for?
Come on girl!
Keep up!
It's the ruby she wants.
What else can it be?
Read us that bit of paper again.
"A place of darkness under a knotted rope. "
"Three red lights shine clearly on the spot when the moon falls on the water "
"Take it.
It is clearly yours by right and the laws of England. "
"antequamhaeclegis, mortuusero, utinam ex hominum courage tamceleritermemory m discedat. "
There you go, he's hidden the ruby and he is telling you where it is
Its some kind of code.
What the bloody hell does that last bit mean?
I don't know, I don't speak Latin.
One good thing if it is the ruby Mrs. Holland wants, she ain't gonna find it without this.
My message is for Miss.
Lockhart alone.
Quite right dear.
We can't just blurt out our secrets to all and sundry.
No..
Oh dear me you do look poorly.
Bring the pipe, Adelaide.
All this suffering, when there really is no need.
One little puff of medicine and you'll be right as rain.
Right as rain.
That's it.
Fetch me when he starts talking.
Bugger!
Robbed?
I do not understand.
Are there any shattered windows?
Any other rooms disturbed?
- Anything missing?
- No, madam.
Why should this robber select you alone?
For his attentions?
What do you have that anyone could possibly want?
Some papers.
Lies now, as well as ingratitude.
This whole business has been got up to make yourself the centre of attention.
Why are you smiling in that impudent fashion?
I will not be smiled at.
I'm smiling because I am leaving.
I can't stay in this house another second.
You can't leave.
Where will you go?
You have nobody and nothing..
If I stay here, I will have you, which is much worse.
Good day to you Mrs. Rees.
Good afternoon.
These bills have been waiting since Easter.
Where's all the money gone?
We have to invest in the business.
How else do you think I bought the polarizing lens?
And the gelatine process.
Damn the gelatine process!
If we don't sort these bills out soon there wont be a business left to run.
I don't need advice on how to run my business by some ranting puppet!
If its about a sitting we can fit you in anytime.
I don't do babies..
- You
- You who is "you?"?
The ugly fright from Swaleness I told you about.
Miss.
Lockhart, my sister, Rosa.
She's an actress, you'll have to forgive the vanity and hysteria.
I'm also the only person who actually earns any money in this establishment.
Something tells me you're not here for a picture?
.
I have nowhere to live.
An old women I barely know is determined to kill me and I have no one left in the world to turn to.
Well...
You'd better come in then.
Mr. Berry.
This calls for a celebration
There's gin in the cupboard.
I signed the pledge in Dartmoor Mrs. Holland.
Alcohol is the cause of madness hallucinations softness of the brain and moral decay.
I think the damage is already done in your case.
I was formally very wicked, but I intend to lead the good life from now on.
Always excepting the odd murder or two.
So this was it was it?
Nothing else?
"A place of darkness under a knotted rope. "
Don't make sense.
Here.
I reckon that's a riddle.
I know its a bleeding' riddle,
I just dunno what it means?
If I didn't know the Major's writing,
I'd say that little cow had made this up to throw me off the scent.
Its our guest calling for his medicine.
I feel like Florence bleeding' Nightingale sometimes.
You'll get your reward in heaven Mrs. H.
I'll take it here on earth, thank you very much, Mr. Berry.
Just to be on the safe side.
Do you remember what the last page said?
I kept a copy in my note book.
"A place of darkness under a knotted rope. "
"Three red lights shine clearly on the spot when the moon pulls on the water"
Oh its Latin.
My brother's a scholar you know?
Only pretends to be stupid.
"Antequam haec legis ..."
"By the time you read this,
I shall be dead. "
"May my memory be - no, may I be as swiftly forgotten.. "
Looks like he knew what was coming.
At least we know this Matthew Bedwell is at Mrs. Holland's.
The problem is getting at him.
Jim said he had a twin brother.
A man of the church.
Oh, be then he'll be in Crockford's Clerical dictionary.
Which of course you know intimately.
Permanently glued to it.
You can stay here as long as you like.
We'll let you pay rent if it will make you feel respectable..
I have no money yet.
But I couldn't help overhearing before.
I could look at your books for you help sort things out.
-I used to do my father's accounts.
- We accept enthusiastically.
If you can make any sense of the business
I don't suppose we will ever let you leave.
Bedwell, Bedwell, Bedwell ...
Ah here we are!
Reverend Nicholas Bedwell,
Born in 1842 curate of St. John's Summertown, Oxford.
That must be the man.
I shall write to him immediately.
Well come on then Are we bankrupt?
Nearly.
But you are owed total 76 pounds and seven shillings.
If you get the money in, you can pay off most of your debt.
What you really need is somebody to find you ways of making more money.
You've hardly begun to exploit the business side.
Of course not, I'm an "artist".
Why don't you do it?
No I have qualifications, I'm not even 20 yet.
That's better than Fred, he'll be ten for the rest of his life.
As long as you are absolutely certain you wish to employ me.
There are no employees here, only equals.
My mother died in the siege of Lucknow.
She was holding me in her arms when she was shot.
Managed to kill the murderer before she died.
She gave her life for me.
And she was the most beautiful woman in the regiment, and the most notorious
She could shoot better than any soldier, curse like a navvy and smoked these tiny black cheroots with an ivory cigarette holder.
The army wives were scandalized of course.
All the men loved her, but my father was the only one she ever loved.
You remember all this?
No err ...
I was just two years when it happened.
All I had left was a pearl handled pistol she used to save my life.
One that was stolen with the papers?
You don't have to worry about me you know I'm quite capable of protecting myself.
Free book-keepers don't grow on trees.
If anything happened to you I'll have to pay someone.
- No need to scowl at me
- I'm not scowling at you.
Your letter says you have important business Mrs. Holland.
God only knows what might be.
Straight to the point, Mr. Selby.
Well, I respect that.
I'm the same myself.
Do you know a sailor named Matthew Bedwell?
-I can't say I do.
- He knows you.
And that ain't all he knows
The schooner Lavinia, ring any bells?
I have no time for sailor's gossip.
Then perhaps you'll have time for the Seven Blessings?
and an oriental gentleman named Ah Ling?
- Have I got your attention now?
- Go on.
Mr. Bedwell knows things about the shipwreck you see ...
Shocking things.
He says the only thing for it is to publish in the newspapers.
How much do you want?
Your letter said you had important news for me Mr. Garland.
It concerns your brother.
He's in a boarding house in Wapping.
He's been there at least a week.
- I knew he was alive!
Thank God.
But why has he not contacted me himself?
- He is smoking opium.
- Again?
Thank you, I'll go fetch him this minute.
It's not that easy I'm afraid.
The boarding house belongs to a woman named Mrs. Holland, who for her own reasons is keeping your brother captive and will not give him up lightly.
The opium must have weakened his mind, she couldn't hold him otherwise There is something else.
My father drowned in the wreck of the Lavinia
Your brother know something about it he has a message for me.
The we shall have to get him out of that wretched place and find out what it is.
I must ask you to do me a service first.
My brother has been an addict for a long time.
Cutting of the supply too quickly might well kill him
I'm afraid you will have to buy me some opium.
I've been looking into the background of the Ruby Agruapur, and it turns out to be something of a legend.
And no one has seen it since the mutiny.
What else did you discover?
The Maharaja was slaughtered by his own people during the uprising.
They said he was a collaborator.
At least, That's the official account.
Who knows, perhaps Marchbanks killed him?
No I don't believe it.
It was a very sad man, but there was something gentle about him.
He wasn't capable of murdering anyone.
I see you adopt the vigorously logical approach to evidence?
This is the place.
I photographed last year.
Madame Sheng's establishment is just a bit further on.
Don't the police know about this?
Probably - so what?
- Opium isn't illegal.
- But its so dangerous.
Mostly the poor and helpless become addicted.
Why ban it when it earns the country a fortune?
How can you be so cynical?
I'm not the cynical one don't you know anything about history?
The British government cultivates opium in India then exports it to the rest of the world.
My God, when the Chinese Emperor tried to ban it a few years ago, we even went to war to make him change his mind.
That's how much the British government cares about cares about the Bedwells of this world.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Good afternoon sir.
Welcome, can I help you?
Good afternoon, Madame Sheng.
Were are not here to smoke we are here to buy.
As you wish.
How much you want?
Sally
- Wake up!
Thank god you're here!
You alright ?
You must have inhaled the smoke.
But it shouldn't have affected you like that.
It was not your first time
I've never smoked opium in my life.
The smoke never lies
It knows you as you know it.
I was having my nightmare.
The one I've had since I was a child
This time it felt more real than ever.
I'm going mad The power of the smoke is beyond limit it hides the secrets of the past so well
The sharpest eyes in the brightest daylight would never find it.
It reveals them like buried treasure.
I heard a man being killed.
Then I saw two men.
They were always like ghosts before but this time they were real.
One of them was Major Marchbanks.
He was younger, but I know it was him.
But the worst thing
The worst thing of all is that the other was my father.
What you saw was not a dream it was a memory.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty,
fifty.
Satisfied?
I can't speak for my gentleman, we shall have to see how the wind blows.
You think you can tap me for money whenever the mood takes you?
What a common turn of phrase!
You'll upset me if you carry on like that.
You'd kill me as soon as look at me wouldn't you?
Wait a moment Mrs. Holland.
I could use a woman with your connections
Suppose I had a proposal.
One that was worth a lot more than blackmail money.
- What are we talking about?
- Protection.
A man in my position can't be too careful.
And what position might that be?
You're not coming it is out of the question.
- Why Not?
- Because...
- I am a woman?
I was going to point out that you have no experience in fighting.
Where as Mr. Bedwell was boxed for his university
- And what fighting have you done?
- I was fencing champion at school.
Which will be enormously useful when Mrs. Holland challenges you to a duel.
This is my battle as much as yours.
WhileFredandSallywere preparing to rescue Mr. Bedwell,
Idecidedto takealittletripthecoastand do some investigating of my own.
Yes, Jimbo!
Is Mrs. Holland here?
You must be Adelaide.
Matthew?
Its me, Nicholas.
We'll have to carry him.
You can't take him she'll kill me.
He do not belong here.
Is that really you?
Can you walk?
We can't leave her here
- Adelaide!
Go!
Go
- I'll buy you some time.
Adelaide!
Mr. Berry?
Well now I've seen everything.
You ain't him you are but you ain't.
Don't just stand there kill him!
Well I hope you don't intend to take communion looking like this.
I shall preach a sermon on the church of militant by way of explanation.
How is my brother?
He's still asleep.
- Ouch!
Don't be a baby.
You'll be safe here.
She'll find me.
If I went to the bottom of the sea she'll find me and drag me back out.
Well at least she wont be able to use this.
My gun!
Yours?
How?
Henry Hopkins took it.
She sent him to nick your stuff and murder you.
But only he was not the killing sort so she done him in.
She's got a knife, she sliced the last girl who was with.
I seen where she put her in the yard
She said she would put me in next to her.
She'd do it now though.
Go to the window.
Quickly!
Have somebody watching the office?
A gentleman, clean shaven, fair hair, sunburned complexion quite tall.
There's hundreds of people out there, What's he wearing?
How do I know, you idiot?
I can't see no one.
Deliver this.
Right now.
Mrs Holland.?
Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure!
What the blazers has it got to do with you?
You read Selby's letter?
Oh no!
That would be dishonest.
Of course I read it.
all it said was he wanted their arrangement to start immediately
Who is he frightened of?
Listen, I there's something else I've got to say
What Selby would be doing now?
What sort of crimes can a shipping agent commit?
- Smuggling?
- Fraud.
Sinking ships and claiming insurance.
probably look what I was going to say ... you'll like this ...
Not owners, they're agents, they only have one ship.
Surely that kind of thing is too easy to find out.
Listen, will you this is important.
You think the Lavinia was sunk on purpose?
- Why would anyone do that?
- I can tell you.
What were you going to say Jim?
It'll keep I wanna hear this.
I know it is not what you crave but if the urge becomes too great, we have what you need.
You'd do that for me?
I will never smoke opium again.
You're Mr. Lockhart's daughter?
I'm sorry, he's dead..
- I know.
- He drowned in the Lavinia.
He didn't drown.
He was murdered.
South China Sea is home to every kind of smuggler pirate, murderer.
Worst of all are the Triads
Lockhart Selby were hand in glove with all these societies
Whole company had the stench of corruption
Not my father.
- No.
But he heard rumours.
That's why he came out to the East.
He was going to see the company agent Hendrik Van Eeden.
He trusted him.
Van Eeden had the reputation of an honest man.
Your father met him in Singapore when he came aboard with his Malaysian servant, Perak.
On the first afternoon out we saw the black junk.
Could have out sailed her easily, but the captain he doesn't.
seemed to be dawdling on purpose it was the second night it happened.
Your father was attacked in his cabin he was stabbed.
I heard him calling for help.
I heard him calling for help, when I found him he was barely alive.
He told me his murderer was the ship's captain.
And he was in the pay of a man named Ah Ling.
I knew then we was all doomed.
Ah Ling heads the most brutal gang in the South China Seas.
Did my father say anything about me?
He told me to explain what had happened and something else.
"Keep your powder dry".
He always said that.
It was his way of telling me to be prepared for anything.
The captain scuttled his own ship while Ah Ling men slaughtered the crew
Nothing can wipe the cries of those dying men from my mind.
Nothing but opium.
The Triad gang that corrupted Lockhart Selby, what was its name?
Its called the Fan Lin society.
"Seven Blessings."
Hey!
Stop thief!
Stop that man!
There's no one in.
Aren't you the sharp one?
"A place in the darkness under a knotted rope. "
"Three red lights shine clearly on the spot. "
There's a kind of sense in it but..
damned if I can see what it is..
I need a drink you could use one, might oil your brain.
I ain't drinking no beer.
I signed the pledge and I've got my principles.
For a thief and murderer you come across very strong on principles Mr. Berry.
Alright you can have a lemonade.
I that little maggot of a thing you call a conscience is satisfied.
.
That's stupid, that is.
If its The Turks Head, you want a head not a rope.
Lets go in.
Lemonade, for a big fellah like you?
My son's got a very delicate stomach.
Alcohol quite upsets him.
That's a very unusual sign you've got.
Don't go with the name.
Turks Head
Of course it does.
Turks Head is a kind of sailor's knot.
Didn't you know that?
Well, I never did.
That explains it then.
Have one yourself love!
Oh!
Might as well.
I was looking for a friend of mine.
Mrs. Thorpe, the housekeeper the major Marchbanks.
Oh well you've had a wasted journey then.
She packed her bags after what happened.
Didn't you know?
He was murdered.
Oh no!
Where the world coming to?
Stabbed.
A burglar they reckon.
He was a regular of mine.
Quiet sort.
Came in most days for his brandy and his newspaper.
Oh did he so?
Is that the privy dear?
That's the cellar.
Privy is outside.
Oh, of course it is.
Do you know?
I think I could eat something?
I've got some nice boiled beef.
Oh!
Just the thing.
Bring the bag.
If she comes back, break her neck.
"A place of darkness under a knotted rope. "
That's this cellar.
"Three red lights."
The buoy out there in the creek, what flashes three times.
"When the moon falls on the water."
When the tide comes in you see?
It all fits.
Oh never mind.
That's it.
Its a box.
I was promised this a very long time ago, Mr. Berry.
I'm only taking what is rightfully mine.
Its empty!
Its bleeding empty.
Its her!
The Lockhart girl No one else knows its here.
I will have that ruby, Mr. Berry.
You see if I don't.
I'm owed it and i will have it.
Then I will cut her heart out and dance on it!
Nicholas?
Where are we going?
I'm looking over a replacement for the Lavinia.
Not that its any of your business.
Only two in the boat, company rules.
I'm supposed to stay with him.
Get a move on will you?
I am a busy man.
You stay here, don't move 'till I get back.
Cod fish!
I give you one simple job.
What did I tell you?
Stay with him all the time.
A bloody stone could understand that!
But it was him what told me to wait.
Your a dab hand at killing people, Mr. Berry,
You ain't much at keeping them alive.
Here you are.
Ah well
Never mind Selby.
He's in no position to ask for a refund is he?
Do you know something, Mr. Berry?
This is an interesting game we're in.
I wouldn't miss it for the world!
Pictures can wait, you know?
We don't have to do them right now.
We can't sit around moping.
We all need something to think about,
More than death and unhappiness
Right, I can take the pictures.
But who's going to sell them?
Have to be you.
My soul is far to fine for base commercial jousting.
You should do it.
I shall.
Soon as I'm old enough to be taken seriously.
I take you seriously.
You mean as a business women?
As all kind of things
Sally, I ...
Look what I found!
- [inaudible] my love.
- Yeah.
- You'd like that wouldn't you?
- Yeah.
Yeh you will.
Get your hands off you rat.
Arrgh she bit me!
Mr. Berry, get him.
Get off you big oaf!
.
Drive on!
They're only a few minutes ahead of us.
We can still get to Wapping before them..
I promised to look after the poor little scrap I promised her.
Jim, we're going to get her back.
- Wait for us
- Round here, you must be joking.
They'll have the shoes off my horse in a minute..
Get out.
What's the plan?
Oh nice tactic Wellington.
- Adelaide!
Adelaide!
Hang on love.
Come on, kick him!
We can get half way to Tobacco Dock.
Up old Gravel bank.
Come on, my son.
Come on.
That's him.
Mrs. Holland's after.
Hey!
Come here!
They're going to kill me Jim, I'm gonna die!
Shut up no one's dying..
Split up.
You go that way.
You're the two Mrs. Holland is looking for ain't you?
You'll be alright with me.
We will have to find a skiff somewhere get you out down the river.
Why are you helping us?
What's that old cow ever done for me?
We keeps the rats down for rent.
There's an alley that leads to the river.
They wont find you there.
Just got to get you across the Wapping Wall.
We'll be safe now.
- Where do we go from here?
-Don't know mate, not my problem.
Sorry mate, gotta live.
You try that again and Mr Berry will twist your head off.
He practices on chickens..
Sometimes they run around flapping for a full 5 minutes after their heads is off..
He'd love to see how long you'd flap about without no head..
Adelaide do not know anything about the Ruby, you don't want her.
Oh I want her alright.
She's going to be sleeping in the yard tonight, ain't you Poppet?
We've got your bed all ready ..
Put her down... or I'll kill you.
I thought I sorted you out.
Mr. Berry, you are losing your touch.
That's four times he's crossed my path I want him dead.
Adelaide?
Adelaide?
They'll be fine
This can't go on.
Its not Adelaide Mrs. Holland wants, its me, she hates me.
I still don't know why.
I have to discover the truth about the ruby.
And there is only one way I can do it.
Opium!
Matthew Bedwell left it behind He said he would not need it.
I have to go back into my nightmare.
I have to finish it.
Only I don't really know what to do.
I do.
Theatre people know a little about this sort of thing.
Sit down on the sofa.
There's no pipe so you'll have to breath in the fumes.
Now just breathe normally the smoke will do the rest.
I'm scared, Rose.
What if I grow to like the smoke?
I became like poor Matthew Bedwell?
You wont.
You were talking.
Sometimes in English but mostly, in a foreign language.
Hindustani
I know everything, Rose.
The whole story.
I have to find the ruby.
Sally, it was a dream.
It was never was a dream.
It was always the truth, buried in my memory all along.
Wait here, there's something you have to know.
Major Marchbanks hid in a pub in Swaleness.
It was Jim who cracked the cipher.
It seems that Black Jack Armstrong does that sort of thing all the time.
in stirring tales for British lads.
Why didn't you tell me?
He tried on the night you rescued Matthew Bedwell.
Then after that he gave it to me for safe keeping.
I think he was frightened of what it does to people.
So am I a little.
Send a message to Mrs. Holland.
Tell her to meet me at Hangman's wharf in an hour's time.
You're mad?
-At least wait for Fred No.
I have to end this.
What ever happens, you must promise not to interfere.
You killed my father.
My real father.
Major Marchbanks.
He sold me in return for a ruby, didn't he?
The Maharaja had given the ruby to my ...
To Captain Lockhart.
As payment for protection during the mutiny.
And Captain?
Lockhart He left the Major guarding the Maharaja in the dark somewhere.
The residency cellars.
Marchbanks deserted his post to smoke opium.
He was an addict.
And somehow, the mutineers They mutineers got in and slaughtered the Maharaja
I saw it all.
Lockhart knocked him down for a coward when he come back.
Then they heard you crying.
Lockhart was so disgusted and a feared at what your life might become.
He offered Marchbanks the ruby, in exchange for you..
And he took it in a second.
His own daughter..
in exchange for jewel.
And now, Miss,
I want that ruby.
Its what I come for - and I got a right to it
- What right?
You have no claim over it.
Oh I got the greatest claim of all.
I was promised that ruby.
By the Maharaja himself.
You were there as well?
Of course I was there.
The Maharaja was in love with me..
Oh yeah...
I might be old and ugly now.
But was beautiful once.
Everyone in northern India knew pretty Molly Edwards.
They all paid court.
But it was the Maharaja that wanted me worst of all.
He promised me the ruby if I give him what he wanted.
And I did.
I could have had a good marriage.
Good prospects and a good name.
And one night with him put pay to all that..
And afterwards, he just laughed
Threw me out the palace.
It was you who betrayed the Maharaja.
It was no more than he deserved.
He squealed like a pig when they cut him.
I've heard that screaming in my dreams.
Yeh and you and all those stuck up army wives would have been next if Lockhart hadn't come back.
All them hypocrites called me slut and whore behind my back
Well?
You know something?
We've got a lot more in common than you'd like.
Me and you.
We was both bought for a ruby.
My father left this to me but I renounce my claim.
It has brought me nothing but death and unhappiness.
And if you want it, you can go and get it.
Its... you pretty Molly.
She'll have her ruby.
Mrs. Holland?
Mrs. Holland?
Mrs. Holland!
Miss.
Lockhart ...
Get into the carriage, I have news regarding your father..
What news?
Who are you?
I was born Hendrik Van Eeden.
In the East though, I'm better known as Ah Ling.
Now go in the carriage.
Where are we going?
The East India Docks.
I do not understand.
My ship sails with the tide.
You may come with me, alive, or you may stay here... dead.
One way or the other I must be certain that you will remain silent..
What will happen to me if I come with you?
Well surely I don't have to explain that.
You are not a child.
You can't be Ah Ling.
You're not Chinese.
You have my Dutch father to thank for the way I look.
But my mother was the daughter of ...
Ling Chi,
An great and noble Chinese businessman
Though you might call him a pirate.
My European looks and education have been a great advantage.
they have made it so much easier to set up an arrangement beneficial to Lockhart and Selby and the Seven Blessings.
Opium was the link.
The finest comes from India.
Grown under British government supervision.
There is an official stamp, a mould if you like to form the drug into little cakes.
All with her Majesty's blessing and approval.
As luck would have it I came into possession of one of those valuable stamps.
After that, it was a simple matter of adulterating premium opium with the low grade stuff from the hills of Penang.
Thus, one shipload became 3 or 4, all certificated and shipped by the British government and the reputable firm of "Lockhart Selby".
Alas,
Captain Lockhart's intervention gave me a great deal of trouble.
So you murdered him?
What's one human life?
When so much money is at stake?
Thousands, perhaps even millions?
But the gods have been kind.
I killed him!
My God, Rose, he murdered so many people.
He killed my ...
I can't call him Captain Lockhart.
He was my father ...
We have to tell the police.
I killed a man.
How would you explain all this?
They'll only have your word for it.
No we go now and we never look back.
You understand me, Sally?
We've got to get out.
Did you leave anything in the carriage?
Anything they might be able to identify?
I shot in the heart from a few inches.
He was dead, I know he was.
There's no sign of Adelaide.
God knows what Mrs. Holland has done with her, but at least there's no new grave in the yard.
Poor little mite.
We are going to find her Jim.
Somehow, or other one day.
We're going to find her I promise you.
Of course we will find her, even if I have to turn detective myself.
Is there anything more in the paper?
Well, the police are convinced there's a murder, but they have no body and no suspects.
That for me?
No as it happens, its for me.
Its from Nicholas Bedwell.
I didn't know you two were corresponding..
That's because its none of your business.
So - what do we call you now?
Lockhart or Marchbanks?
Whenever I hear the word 'father' I know who I think of.
And I don't know what my legal status is.
or what rubies count for in a court of law
But I'm Sally Lockhart,
I work for a photographer and that's all anyone needs to know.
Fresh in today Miss.
My name Perak, Miss.
Lockhart.
I was your father's servant.
He said I must deliver this in person.
apologies - my journey has been long and with many difficulties.
"Look under the clock."
What does it mean?
Your father said you will understand.
Thank you.
AndlaterSallydid understand.
Itwastimetopayonefinal visit to her childhood home, andforthepast,togiveup the last of its secrets.

Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Get off my lawn!
Trespasser.
Do you want to be eaten alive?
- No.
- Then get out of here!
My trike.
Stay away from my house!
- DJ!
- We're gonna be late.
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming.
I'm coming.
October 30th: another tricycle.
I'm coming.
Mom.
Mom, he did it again.
He took another tricycle.
Okay, honey, we've talked about this.
You cannot stay up in your room all day staring at an old man through a telescope.
But, Mom, there's something wrong with that house.
I'm serious.
What was that?
I'm serious.
His voice sounds funny.
Someone is hitting puberty.
"What's happening to my body?" Right, buddy?
Maybe you should come with us.
Oh, the boy's too busy.
He's got his spying to do.
I'm not spying.
Well...
"Well..." That's okay, buddy.
When I was your age, I did exactly the same thing.
Of course, it was with binoculars and involved the lovely Jensen twins.
Neither of which was as lovely as your beautiful mother.
Will you be an angel and help me bring out the incisor?
- The incisor.
- Hold this.
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.
Elizabeth will be here in a few hours.
If anything happens, call the police and hide.
He knows that.
See you tomorrow night.
- What have you done?
- Just let me drive this thing, will you?
- Where is DJ?
Where's DJ?
- I'm fine.
You would be so happy if he was under the car, wouldn't you?
Sorry.
It's hard to see with the mask on.
Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder?
Why did you put up your window?
- Chowder.
- It's aerodynamic.
- Hi, DJ.
- We've got to make time.
The children.
The children.
- What children?
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Tell him you love him, dear.
- He knows that.
- Tell your son you love him.
- I don't wanna tell him.
- He knows I love him.
- He's your son.
- You have to say it.
Roll it down.
- We're gonna be late.
We both love you.
- That includes your dad.
- That's right.
- He's had enough kisses.
- Blow him a kiss.
- Blow him a kiss.
- Goodbye.
Cheer up.
It's almost Halloween.
In one day and three hours, it's candy time.
Okay?
- Check it out, I got a new ball.
- Cool.
Oh, speaking of which, have you decided?
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?
Chowder.
I don't think I'm going trick-or-treating this year.
What?
Come on, you're gonna break a six-year streak.
Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.
Maybe I'm getting too grown-up.
Three seconds on the clock.
I'm playing basketball.
It's time for an in-your-face disgrace.
- Are you okay?
- My nose is in my brains.
Let me see.
Oh, my God.
- What?
- You're a dork.
Where's my ball?
Oh, no.
- Sorry, man.
- Wait, wait.
DJ.
You're a grownup now, you go get it.
Chowder, your ball just landed on Nebbercracker's lawn.
It doesn't exist anymore.
I paid $28 for that ball.
I raked 10 yards and asked my mom for a dollar 26 times.
I never worked that hard in my life...
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.
- So?
- So maybe he's sleeping.
All right, I'll do it.
I'll never forget this.
Hurry, though.
Go.
You.
- No.
- DJ, run!
Get the ball and run!
You're so close.
What have you done?
- Just nudge it over here.
- I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I didn't mean...
You are dead.
DJ, come on, come on!
- Chowder.
- Come on, DJ.
Help.
Chowder.
Help.
Help.
- You think you can terrorize my lawn?
- No, I'm sorry.
- You wanna be a dead person?
- No.
I love life.
This place is not a playground for children.
- Got it from now on.
- This is my house!
Why can't you respect that?
Why can't you just stay away from...?
Push.
No siren.
Never a good sign.
I'm a murderer.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?
When it's an accident, they call it manslaughter.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Great.
Babysitter's here.
See you, DJ.
Perfect.
DJ.
Hey, DJ, I just saw an ambulance.
Did I miss anything interesting?
Hello?
Elizabeth can I talk to you about something?
Oh, yeah, of course you can, cantaloupe.
We are gonna have the bestest time.
- Got tons of neat activities planned.
- They already left.
- They did?
They're gone?
- Yes, and I need to talk to you.
So the usual deal: indoors by 9, in your room by 11.
- Lights out, your call.
- Elizabeth.
- And it's Zee.
- "Zee"?
Now, listen up.
I control the TV, the stereo and the phone.
I don't do board games, Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.
I'm not your mother.
I'm not your friend.
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay?
I am practically a grownup.
I don't even need you here, Elizabeth.
- Gosh, DJ, why'd you break that?
- But I didn't.
Yeah, let me ask you something.
Who are they gonna believe?
- Go to your room.
- Fine.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, very funny.
See how you like it.
Happy Halloween, doofus.
Nice one, Bones.
Look at his face.
That's funny.
You're not supposed to have friends over.
Who's this?
- This is Bones.
- What's up?
- He's in a band.
- That's right.
And, anyway, cantaloupe, let's not open up the rulebook, okay?
Since you're up way past your bedtime.
No, no, no, this is different.
Listen.
You called the neighbors.
Good for you.
I used star-69.
He called me.
- Who called you?
- Nebbercracker.
P.S., he died today.
- You lie.
- Do not.
He died, and now I'm getting phone calls from his house.
A phone call from beyond the grave.
Guys, come on.
I'm serious.
Oh, he's serious.
Did you know he was serious?
- Come on, man, give her back.
- Oh, "her"?
You mind?
Oh, come on.
Gross.
- Come on, Bones.
- Wait, hold on, dude.
Ith...
She's having trouble breathing.
Might have something in her throat.
All right, I'll look into it.
- No.
Elizabeth.
No.
- Okay, Bones, knock it off.
Downstairs, now.
Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.
You are so funny.
I know.
It's like I don't even try and it just happens.
God, stop doing this.
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do?
- Homicide.
- Chowder, where are your parents?
My dad's at the pharmacy and my mom's at the movies with her personal trainer.
- Meet me at the Danger Zone now.
- Fine.
- Bones, I said, knock it off.
- Come on, man.
No, I'm creeped out.
You know, I saw an ambulance here today.
So?
So maybe Nebbercracker really did die.
We should be so lucky.
The guy is evil.
No, he's just a crotchety old dude.
Oh, really, Zee?
When I was 10 years old, I had a kite.
Awesome kite.
I could fly it so high you couldn't see it.
One day, it crashed down.
I followed the string and it ended right over there across the street, right at the edge of his lawn.
Did he take your kite?
Yeah, he takes whatever lands on his lawn.
But that's not the point.
The point is, is that I saw him talking to his house and kissing it.
Besides everybody knows what he did to his wife.
Why?
What...?
What did he do to her?
- He ate her.
- Bones.
Get off.
Stop it!
- Bones, enough.
- Come on, Zee.
Bones, I'm so sick of you.
- I was just...
- You have no respect for women.
What?
What does that mean?
Get out.
Fine.
Prude.
What are you looking at?
Nebbercracker.
You really are dead, aren't you?
I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.
What are you gonna do about it, Nebbercracker?
Nebber-snapper-flipper-dipper...
My awesome kite.
Chowder.
Chowder.
Chowder?
Chowder.
Heat seeker.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Shut up.
What?
Nebbercracker's back from the dead.
- No way.
- Yeah.
They leave the keys in here.
You dare me?
Chowder, you're not listening to me.
Nebbercracker's haunting me, all right?
His blood is on my hands.
And now he's coming back for revenge.
You're really crazy right now.
Have you noticed that?
I think you're just freaking out because you killed a guy today.
Life goes on.
For you.
Try and relax.
Be cool, like me.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Make it stop.
Quit screwing around.
I need your help.
Fine.
You want my help?
- Yeah.
- I got three words for you:
"Trick or treat."
Okay.
Whatever.
Let's go.
Hold on.
Chowder, come on.
The haunting is subtle yet really, really boring.
- Can I go home now?
- Chowder, he'll hear you.
DJ this is why nobody will sit next to us at lunch.
I'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house and you'll see.
No ghost.
Chowder, stop, please.
Chowder, I'm serious.
Chowder, come back.
Come back here, please, Chowder.
Come on.
Chowder.
Come back.
- Oh, no.
A bottle.
- Chowder, put that down.
- Come back, please.
- Bottle.
Hey, DJ, who am I?
Get off my lawn.
Don't.
Come on.
Run.
Chowder, get out of there.
- Chowder, come here.
- Mommy.
This way.
This way.
Help.
Come on, Chowder!
Chowder, this way!
Don't look back.
I looked back.
Bones?
Coming.
Don't even think about crawling back here...
Trick or treat.
What?
Good morning, ma'am.
You witnessed a simulation of what you'll face this evening.
Studies show that households that run out of candy are 55 percent more likely to be TP'd.
To help avert this tragedy I'm here selling Halloween candy for my school, Westbrook Prep.
Good school.
I got kicked out of there.
Now, what do you want?
Just trying to get a head start on life and secure a successful future.
You want a successful future?
When a guy with tattoos comes up to the drive-through give him his burger, not your phone number.
Thank you for the advice.
I'll be sure to make a note of it.
But back to business.
Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.
Without candy, I'm afraid your house is a bull's-eye with shingles.
Nice try.
It's not my house.
Babysitter?
Okay, let's cut the crap.
Maybe the parents you work for left you $40 in emergency money.
Maybe they left me 30.
Maybe you give me 20, I write a receipt for 30 and you pocket 10.
Maybe.
And I want two extra bags of peanut clusters.
One bag and I'll toss in a licorice whip.
You're good.
Eight A.M. No detectable movement.
No detectable movement.
Hey, DJ, I brought you some chocolate.
Cover blown?
No detectable movement.
What are you two weirdoes up to?
Oh, nothing.
Just something in the house across the street just tried to eat us.
Yeah.
We've been watching all night.
We haven't even left this room once.
Not even to go to the bathroom.
Don't drink that.
Oh, gross.
Whatever disease you guys have I'm sure it's got letters and that they make pills for it.
Zee, it's true.
There's something evil going on across the street.
That's excellent.
I'm really happy for you.
Anyway, have you two astronomers seen Bones?
He left last night unexpectedly and he never came back.
Never came back?
- Bottle.
- Of course.
Oh, okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.
Listen, Zee, I don't know how to tell you this...
Your boyfriend has most likely been eaten alive.
Sherry Klausen.
I gotta go.
Breakfast.
Happy Halloween, losers.
Hello.
What?
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
Let me see.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- No.
No.
Hey.
- Hey, wait.
Hey.
DJ, that's your phone.
- No, stop.
- Girl.
Hey.
- Don't go in there.
- Hold it.
Don't go any further.
- Come here.
- Yes, over here.
Are you guys mentally challenged?
If you are, I'm certified to teach you baseball.
Detectable movement.
- What do we do?
What do we do?
- Come on.
Guys.
- Run, Chowder.
- I'm running.
Help, please.
- Got her.
- No, I got her.
Hello?
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.
There's an angry dad on the phone looking for the one called Chowder.
Hello?
Losers, I'm talking to you.
He's worried about you.
He should be.
- Start explaining.
- All right, the house, it tried to eat us.
- Stop explaining, I've had enough.
- Wait, wait, where are you going?
To see what's happening with that stupid house of yours.
- No, no, no.
You can't.
- What is your problem?
Puberty.
Yeah, I'm having lots and lots of puberty.
- No more Mountain Dew.
- Right.
I'm going to find Bones.
All right, you have fun.
Don't worry about us, we'll be fine.
And you tell him I said hey, okay?
Safe driving.
See you.
Oh, hi.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Oh, yeah.
I made the whole puberty thing up.
Hi, I'm JD.
DJ.
Yes, Dad, I meant to call you, but I forgot.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay.
Absolutely.
Affirmative.
- Okay, love you.
Bye.
- Yeah.
And this is our little observation post such as it were.
Yeah, posters are stupid.
I was gonna tear them down and put up some art.
Well, Dad, why don't you kiss my hairy butt?
Hey, DJ, you got any beer?
Well, hello there.
This is Chowder.
Charles, to the ladies.
Jenny Bennett.
Two-term class president at Westbrook Prep.
- That's a tough school to get into.
- Yeah, I got in, but decided not to go.
It's a girls' school.
Which is why I didn't.
You know, there's a...
There's a great taco stand near there.
I hate Mexican food.
- Me too.
- Me too.
Fascinating, isn't it?
Just sits there waiting mocking us with its houseness.
- May I please use your phone?
- Yeah, sure.
Here.
Who you calling?
- My mother.
- Rude.
She's probably not gonna believe you.
It's too much for the adult mind to comprehend.
Is this pee?
Because if it is, that's really gross.
- It's...
- DJ?
You pee in bottles?
What are you talking about?
That one's your pee.
- It's yours.
- It's his.
- May I speak with Allison?
- Unsanitary.
- Her daughter.
Thank you.
- It's his pee.
Excuse me.
I was selling chocolates in Mayville, and, well, it's kind of confusing.
So you hate Mexican food, huh?
Yeah.
You too, huh?
Yeah, in fact, you might say I started hating it first.
Outside in front of the house?
- Fine.
Let's get technical.
- Okay.
I started hating it through the telescope.
Can't call dibs on a girl through a telescope.
You can't call dibs on a girl.
- Just did.
- Me too.
She didn't believe me.
Authority can be so:
Okay.
Normally I don't spend time with guys like you.
But a house just tried to eat me, so you've got one hour.
Oh, a puppy.
Didn't see that coming.
Okay I think it's time to call the police.
Do you realize what's gonna happen tonight?
Hundreds of kids walking right up to that house.
Wait, wait, wait.
Come on.
Guys, I think we're overreacting.
Think about it.
Only a total moron would walk up to old man Nebbercracker's house.
- Hey, my ball.
- Chowder.
No.
It's gonna be a bloodbath.
Good news.
The cops are here.
All right, kids, this better be good.
I was in the forest wrestling with a bear claw when we got the call.
I was eating a doughnut.
All three of you, step to the car now.
- My ears.
- They're at the car.
He's a rookie.
First week on the job.
Officer, we have reason to believe there's a dangerous creature inside that house.
- It may have killed a man.
- And a dog.
Doggy down?
We've got a situation.
- We've got a situation.
- What are you doing?
Calling for backup.
Didn't you hear the kid?
There's a dangerous creature inside that house.
We don't have backup.
It's just Judy at the station.
And this is no situation.
It's just a couple Tater Tots hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.
I bet you the dead dog would beg to differ.
What was that?
Nothing.
All right.
Time's up, peewees.
- It's Halloween.
We got things to do.
- We do?
No, wait, you can't.
All right, this thing, it has a mouth and it comes out and grabs things and pulls them in and eats them.
Yeah, like this:
Okay, okay, okay.
The thing is we're trying to make this sound more real than it normally would.
Problem is it sounds kind of not real.
- So we'll see you later.
- No.
All right.
I'll show you.
But if things get out of hand...
We'll aim for Bigfoot.
That's loaded.
He's hopping.
Smart house.
Hey.
You...
Both of you.
Come here.
Bring it to the car.
Come on.
I'm gonna forget you throwing that rock because that dance was pretty funny.
But next time any of you mess with this guy's house all three of you are going in the hole, you got it?
Now, I'll give you 10 seconds to march.
But we need your help.
It's your job to help us.
- One.
- Come on.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
That's tender.
My house is right over there.
So much for relying on the government.
Yeah, I know.
I hate the government.
- Dude, we're screwed.
- No, we're not.
We'll go to an expert.
You're looking at the three-time, tri-state over-14 "Thou Art Dead" champion.
His name is Reginald Skulinski.
But they call him Skull.
- Who's "they"?
- Me and DJ.
- Yeah.
- He's the smartest guy on earth.
So let's go talk to him.
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny.
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on.
Hold up.
Skull is in the game zone right now.
You don't wanna mess with him when he's in the game zone.
Fine, so how long is he gonna be playing?
Die.
Die.
Who knows?
He once played for four days straight on one quarter, a gallon of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.
The man's a legend.
Well, if he's not coming out of the game zone, then we are going in.
- What?
Hey, what are you...?
- What?
Jenny, no.
It's like you're not gonna...
You're not gonna do it.
Like...
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die.
Watch out.
Did you see that?
I just chopped off your head again.
Your head's rolling.
You can't see it, your eyes are on your head.
- Sir?
- What?
I'm busy playing a video game without even looking at the screen.
What?
Old man Nebbercracker's house is possessed.
I need to know how to destroy it before it kills people.
Calm down.
You make me wanna throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.
Oh, you like the steel of my blade?
It's so cold.
Possessed house, you say?
In my travels to the video store and comic-book conventions I've seen many strange and wondrous things.
And I've heard tell of man-made structures becoming possessed by a human soul so that the spirit becomes merged with wood and brick creating a rare form of monster known as Domus mactabilis.
The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.
We're its murderous enemies.
Have fun getting killed.
Run, coward.
Look at that blood.
So how do we kill it?
You've gotta strike at the source of life: the heart.
But houses don't have hearts.
Yes!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You might be right about that.
Sorry, children, but I've got some very important business to take care of.
I won't be seeing you later.
Thou art dead.
So we need to strike at the heart.
Yeah, but where are we gonna find a heart inside a house?
Ever since Nebbercracker died there's been smoke coming out of that chimney.
The furnace.
The furnace is the heart.
If we wanna put out the fire, we're gonna have to go inside.
Without getting chewed to pieces.
- Dummy.
- Hey, I was just doodling.
No, Chowder, this is it.
First, we build a dummy.
We fill the dummy with a few gallons of cold medicine.
- Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy.
- Say what?
Feed the dummy to the house, house eats the medicine, goes to sleep.
- Look at this.
- We get in, douse the fire and get out.
- Questions?
- Yes, are you nuts?
I don't wanna steal drugs from my father I don't wanna go inside a monster and I don't wanna die.
- I say it's worth a shot.
- Yes, I agree, let's do it.
Hey, but I wanted that one.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Yes.
- Chowder.
Quiet.
- Sorry.
Go.
Whoopsie-daisy.
All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy, I'm gonna move you into position.
You don't be scared.
That's not how I trained you.
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.
Chowder, come on.
Okay.
Yes.
Trick or treat.
Plug it in.
So close.
Littering, loitering, vandalism, vagrancy...
- And treason.
- No, not treason.
- You sure?
Because in the book...
- I'm sure.
All right, kids, out of the trash cans.
Let's go.
Come on.
You heard the big guy.
You see the light.
Walk towards it.
Come on, keep it moving.
All right, drop your weapons.
Pass them to me.
Come on.
- I will shoot you.
- Well, lookie we got here.
You stay here, I'm checking this out.
I am on it.
Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me?
Huh, tough girl?
You disrespecting the badge?
You don't want none of this.
I'm telling you.
Test me.
Please.
Y'all wanna test me?
I am the police.
I know you're a thug.
Them brown eyes...
I see it in your eyes.
That's it.
That is it.
You got something to say, Porky, huh?
- That's it, we're taking them in.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Where we taking them?
- To jail.
Let's go.
You hear that?
You guys are going to jail.
But, officer, you've gotta believe us.
Yeah, 2-percent, you got the right to shut up.
- Okay, the house is a monster.
- And to think I believed you.
Hey, listen, I'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.
I mean, kind of a cop.
He has a gun.
Yeah.
They're gonna love you downtown, Jughead.
We are supercops.
Yeah.
That's why I live in a condo.
Supercop.
Super-duper-duper-cop.
Super...
- You hear that?
- That's my stomach.
I'm starving.
No, no.
That sounds like the dangerous creature.
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Oh, my gosh.
This is like trying to wrangle a puppy.
All right, I'll be back.
- You guys, stop.
- Hey, guys.
- No.
Get out of there.
- No, don't go in there.
What?
I tell you.
Super-roll.
- Stop.
Stop.
- Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
You don't know what's up with that house.
Where you at, spooky creature?
I'm gonna find you.
Freeze tree.
Hey, what you doing?
You can't do that.
Not to an officer, brother.
That is illegal.
- I'm coming, buddy.
- Put me down!
- I'm gonna go get backup.
- I thought there was no backup.
I'm getting Judy.
Judy!
Help!
Mama!
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
- I think I'm having a stroke.
- Just try to stay calm, okay?
We'll be all right if we just stay calm.
I'm too young to die!
Jenny.
I've always loved you.
- Chowder!
- Sorry.
Mama!
I can't look.
Guys, come on.
Let's go.
We're dead.
You've killed us and now we're dead.
I don't think the house knows that we're in here.
I bet it thinks we're still in the car.
Listen.
It sounds like it's sleeping.
The only way that we're gonna get out of here alive is if we find the heart, we put out the fire.
Maybe we should examine our other options.
Sure.
Other option:
We wait here and do nothing until it wakes up and eats us.
Find the heart, put out the fire.
Got it.
Explosives.
That's so cool.
- He was watching me.
- DJ.
Did you ever see a wife?
People used to say he had one but he fattened her up and he ate her.
"Demolition squad."
Sorry.
Come on.
Be quiet.
Don't worry, I have a very light step.
There.
Right there.
Shoot it.
What?
I thought if I shot the heart, that...
- That's not the heart.
- Then what is it?
Well, if those are the teeth and that's the tongue then that must be the uvula.
So it's a girl house.
What?
No.
It stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.
Not me.
No.
Okay.
Let's move.
We need to move quickly and quietly.
Don't touch anything.
And stay together...
- DJ!
- Wait.
DJ.
I'll save you.
Chowder, knock it off.
Sorry.
I thought you were...
DJ!
- Chowder, it's a toy.
- Oh, yeah.
Where's DJ?
- DJ.
- Over here.
Look at all these toys.
This must be where Nebbercracker kept his stash.
"Stash."
I think you guys should have a look at this.
- The key.
- Come on, we don't have time for this.
Yeah, we've gotta find a way out of here.
What are you doing?
We have a Ping-Pong table in our basement.
Constance.
Holy moly.
He really did eat her.
Couldn't have.
Her whole body is buried in cement.
Look at all this stuff.
Why would he build her a shrine if he murdered her?
Maybe he just felt guilty or something.
DJ, can we please get out of here?
I always knew you were hiding something, Mr. Nebbercracker.
DJ.
Way to go, big nose.
- It's awake.
- Run!
Hide.
Hey, I know that sound.
My ball.
Where are you going?
Come here.
- Chowder, come back.
- You get back here.
Gotcha.
Killer Slinkys!
- Chowder.
- Leave me alone!
DJ!
Help!
Oh, no.
Get off.
Jenny.
Chowder.
Come on, Chowder, grab on.
Gotcha.
DJ, look out!
No!
The uvula.
- DJ...
- Chowder.
Mommy!
Gross.
Did we just get upchucked?
The uvula, nature's emergency exit.
That's it.
Another great idea, DJ.
Brilliant.
What do you want from me, Chowder?
I don't see you coming up with any big ideas.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Do you wanna hear my big idea?
I'm going home to make a pretzel sandwich.
See you.
Chowder, the house is still alive and you're gonna wuss out?
I risked my life for you.
I stole drugs for you and I could've died in there.
- Yeah, me too.
You're the one that killed Nebbercracker in the first place.
- Getting your ball back.
- You guys.
Stop fighting.
You're acting like babies.
We are babies.
What were we thinking?
We tried to put a house to sleep with cold medicine.
- How lame can you get?
- Where are you going?
I'm going home.
I suck.
DJ.
At least it's an ambulance.
DJ?
It's a ghost.
Begone.
Fie.
Begone yourself.
Get away.
He's not a ghost.
He's not dead.
I'm not a murderer.
Of course I'm not dead.
Who said I was dead?
You'll be dead if you don't scram.
- Come on, DJ.
- Let's hurry.
Don't you know what day this is?
I'm running out of time.
I'm running out of time.
Honey I'm home.
Oh, look at you, dear.
Your shingles are all ruffled and your windows are cracked.
Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart.
It's no problem at all.
It's her.
The house is her.
- DJ, what are you doing?
- Wait.
Come on.
- Come back.
- Where you going?
Nothing paint and varnish can't handle.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know about Constance.
You what?
What do you know?
You don't know anything.
You were in my house?
You...
You didn't kill her, did you?
I love her so much.
Hello?
It's okay.
I can take you away from here.
Would you like that?
Yes.
There we go.
Won't be long now.
All right.
Okay, open your eyes.
- Now, it's not much, I know, but just...
- Darling.
Get away from my house!
I'm gonna rip them to bits.
Help.
- Constance.
- Help.
Help.
- What's wrong?
Are you hurt?
- Hurt?
Yes, I'm hurt.
Those criminals are attacking our house.
- Trick or treat.
- Now, now they're just kids, dear.
- It's Halloween.
- No, no, no.
It's my house, and they're hurting me.
Constance, look at me.
Look at me.
As long as I'm here, I will never let anyone hurt you.
- Constance.
- Sucker.
You vandals.
- Eat this.
- You hooligans.
- I'll get you.
- Constance, no!
So I finished the house.
She would've wanted that.
She died, but she didn't leave.
And that night that one night of every year I had to take precautions.
- Trick or treat.
- I had to.
- Sucker.
- I had to.
Hey!
Get a...
Stay away from my house!
She attacks anyone who comes near.
Go.
I'm coming, dear.
Go.
No, no, no, wait.
I can't let you do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know that you've been protecting us all these years.
But now it's our turn to protect you.
Let her go.
But if I let her go then I'll have no one.
That's not true.
Constance, no!
Come on.
The house is alive!
This way.
This way.
Come on.
You guys, come on.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to slow the house down.
Move it, pork chop.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Mr. Nebbercracker.
Come on.
I can't.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Hurry.
Go on.
I'll be all right.
Oh, man.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
You stay away from those children, Constance!
Constance.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, now...
There, there, girl.
My sweet.
You've been a bad girl, haven't you?
You've hurt people.
Oh, Constance.
Oh, we've always known this day would come.
Haven't we?
I have to make things right.
I have to make things right.
Constance.
I've always done what's best for you, haven't I?
Haven't I, girl?
Come on, let's move.
Oh, Constance.
Let this be the right thing to do.
Leave him alone!
Yeah, get your grubby branches off the old man!
Take that!
And that!
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, kid, come here.
- Take this.
- What?
You have to help me.
Please.
I know you can do it.
Go on.
Go.
Hurry.
How do you know how to drive this thing?
I don't.
The chimney.
The chimney leads to the heart.
Jenny!
Jenny.
Are you all right?
I'm not sure.
DJ, get rid of that thing.
I'm working on it.
Chowder, I need you to get the house down under that crane.
Think you could do that?
Piece of cake.
Come on.
You think you can just mess with my friends?
DJ, look.
Mommy.
Chowder.
Come in, Chowder.
Chowder, buddy?
Hey, guys.
Look who just won.
It's me, the screw-up.
Way to go, Chowder, you did it!
Look at me.
Look at Chowder.
Oh, yeah.
- Sorry.
- Guys, come on.
Yes.
Look at me.
You can't do that.
That's not fair.
No.
Get on the top.
Help!
That's it, Chowder.
Keep her coming.
You ain't nothing.
You're a shack.
You're an outhouse.
No!
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Go.
I kissed a girl.
I kissed a girl on the lips.
Guys.
Any time now.
Sorry.
DJ, hurry.
I'm flying!
- On three, light the dynamite.
- Okay, I got it.
- One.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Two.
- Yes.
Thr...
DJ!
Three!
Do you guys hear something?
It's over there.
Come on.
Oh, my dear.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry, Mr. Nebbercracker, about your house and your wife.
Your house-wife.
Forty-five years.
We have been trapped for 45 years.
And now we're free.
We're free.
Thank you, friend.
Thank you all.
We're free.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
Next.
What happened to Nebbercracker's house?
It turned into a monster, so I blew it up.
Trick or treat.
We're gonna need a tricycle.
One tricycle, coming up.
Tricycle.
Tricycle.
- Tricycle.
- Hello, tricycle.
I missed you so much.
- Thank you, mister.
- Goodbye, now.
- Happy Halloween.
- Come on.
- Mom.
There's my mom.
- Jenny!
- One second.
- Okay.
So...
We should hang out again.
Soon.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
See you.
Good luck with the puberty.
She grabbed my butt.
That's nice, Chowder.
Hey, Mr. Nebbercracker.
It's time to go.
Oh, you go on.
I've got some work to do.
All right.
Thanks.
- I'll see you around.
- All right.
Bye.
Hey.
Stay off my lawn.
I'm just kidding.
- You think he'll be okay?
- Yeah.
He'll be fine.
He'll go on vacation, get some color, maybe he'll meet someone new.
This time, maybe a nice beach house.
Hey, DJ, look who's here.
- Yes, I can see that, thank you.
- No biggie.
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, Dad.
What the heck kind...?
No, don't tell me.
Let me guess.
It's...
- Dirty pirates?
- That's it.
Dirty pirates.
Fun, fun.
Oh, you look adorable.
Have fun tonight.
You know, you were right.
We're definitely too old for trick-or-treating.
Oh, yeah.
No question about it.
On the other hand we've been working all night.
Candy time?
Candy time.
We're back.
Yes.
Candy.
- Did we just get...?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's Halloween, right?
What do you say you and I go out and "inspect" some candy, huh?
We should go eat some candy too.
That's a good idea.
Okay.
All right.
Let's go eat some candy.
Lots of yummy candy.
Like carrots.
All right, where's the car?
And that is how I slayed that mystical dragon.
Oh, yeah?
That's great.
Come on, baby.
We're out of here.
Not so fast, Bones.
Times have changed.
Skull's not like you.
He gives me the respect I deserve and makes time for me.
Whatever.
Bones!
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Correction times and very more time stabilty by:
Klaff2004
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Get off my lawn!
Trespasser.
Do you want to be eaten alive?
- No.
- Then get out of here!
My trike.
Stay away from my house!
- DJ!
- We're gonna be late.
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming.
I'm coming.
October 30th: another tricycle.
I'm coming.
Mom.
Mom, he did it again.
He took another tricycle.
Okay, honey, we've talked about this.
You cannot stay up in your room all day staring at an old man through a telescope.
But, Mom, there's something wrong with that house.
I'm serious.
What was that?
I'm serious.
His voice sounds funny.
Someone is hitting puberty.
"What's happening to my body?" Right, buddy?
Maybe you should come with us.
Oh, the boy's too busy.
He's got his spying to do.
I'm not spying.
- Well...
- "Well..." That's okay, buddy.
When I was your age, I did exactly the same thing.
Of course, it was with binoculars and involved the lovely Jensen twins.
Neither of which was as lovely as your beautiful mother.
Will you be an angel and help me bring out the incisor?
- The incisor.
- Hold this.
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.
Elizabeth will be here in a few hours.
If anything happens, call the police and hide in your closet.
He knows that.
See you tomorrow night.
- What have you done?
- Just let me drive this thing, will you?
- Where is DJ?
Where's DJ?
- I'm fine.
You would be so happy if he was under the car, wouldn't you?
Sorry.
It's hard to see with the mask on.
Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder?
Why did you put up your window?
- Chowder.
- It's aerodynamic.
- Hi, DJ.
- We've got to make time.
The children.
The children.
- What children?
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Tell him you love him, dear.
- He knows that.
- Tell your son you love him.
- I don't wanna tell him.
- He knows I love him.
- He's your son.
- You have to say it.
Roll it down.
- We're gonna be late.
We both love you.
- That includes your dad.
- That's right.
- He's had enough kisses.
- Blow him a kiss.
- Blow him a kiss.
- Goodbye.
Cheer up.
It's almost Halloween.
In one day and three hours, it's candy time.
Okay?
- Check it out, I got a new ball.
- Cool.
Oh, speaking of which, have you decided?
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?
Chowder.
I don't think I'm going trick-or-treating this year.
What?
Come on, you're gonna break a six-year streak.
Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.
Maybe I'm getting too grown-up.
Three seconds on the clock.
I'm playing basketball.
It's time for an in-your-face disgrace.
- Are you okay?
- My nose is in my brains.
Let me see.
Oh, my God.
- What?
- You're a dork.
Where's my ball?
Oh, no.
- Sorry, man.
- Wait, wait.
DJ.
You're a grownup now, you go get it.
Chowder, your ball just landed on Nebbercracker's lawn.
It doesn't exist anymore.
I paid $28 for that ball.
I raked 10 yards and asked my mom for a dollar 26 times.
I never worked that hard in my life...
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.
- So?
- So maybe he's sleeping.
All right, I'll do it.
I'll never forget this.
Hurry, though.
Go.
You.
- No.
- DJ, run!
Get the ball and run!
You're so close.
What have you done?
- Just nudge it over here.
- I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I didn't mean...
You are dead.
DJ, come on, come on!
- Chowder.
- Come on, DJ.
Help.
Chowder.
Help.
Help.
- You think you can terrorize my lawn?
- No, I'm sorry.
- You wanna be a dead person?
- No.
I love life.
This place is not a playground for children.
- Got it from now on.
- This is my house!
Why can't you respect that?
Why can't you just stay away from...?
Push.
No siren.
Never a good sign.
I'm a murderer.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?
When it's an accident, they call it manslaughter.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Great.
Babysitter's here.
See you, DJ.
Perfect.
DJ.
Hey, DJ, I just saw an ambulance.
Did I miss anything interesting?
Hello?
Elizabeth can I talk to you about something?
Oh, yeah, of course you can, cantaloupe.
We are gonna have the bestest time.
- Got tons of neat activities planned.
- They already left.
- They did?
They're gone?
- Yes, and I need to talk to you.
So the usual deal: indoors by 9, in your room by 11.
- Lights out, your call.
- Elizabeth.
- And it's Zee.
- "Zee"?
Now, listen up.
I control the TV, the stereo and the phone.
I don't do board games, Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.
I'm not your mother.
I'm not your friend.
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay?
I am practically a grownup.
I don't even need you here, Elizabeth.
- Gosh, DJ, why'd you break that?
- But I didn't.
Yeah, let me ask you something.
Who are they gonna believe?
- Go to your room.
- Fine.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, very funny.
See how you like it.
Happy Halloween, doofus.
Nice one, Bones.
Look at his face.
That's funny.
You're not supposed to have friends over.
Who's this?
- This is Bones.
- What's up?
- He's in a band.
- That's right.
And, anyway, cantaloupe, let's not open up the rulebook, okay?
Since you're up way past your bedtime.
No, no, no, this is different.
Listen.
You called the neighbors.
Good for you.
I used star-69.
He called me.
- Who called you?
- Nebbercracker.
P.S., he died today.
- You lie.
- Do not.
He died, and now I'm getting phone calls from his house.
A phone call from beyond the grave.
Guys, come on.
I'm serious.
Oh, he's serious.
Did you know he was serious?
- Come on, man, give her back.
- Oh, "her"?
You mind?
Oh, come on.
Gross.
- Come on, Bones.
- Wait, hold on, dude.
I th...
She's having trouble breathing.
Might have something in her throat.
All right, I'll look into it.
- No.
Elizabeth.
No.
- Okay, Bones, knock it off.
Downstairs, now.
Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.
You are so funny.
I know.
It's like I don't even try and it just happens.
God, stop doing this.
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do?
- Homicide.
- Chowder, where are your parents?
My dad's at the pharmacy and my mom's at the movies with her personal trainer.
- Meet me at the Danger Zone now.
- Fine.
- Bones, I said, knock it off.
- Come on, man.
No, I'm creeped out.
You know, I saw an ambulance here today.
So?
So maybe Nebbercracker really did die.
We should be so lucky.
The guy is evil.
No, he's just a crotchety old dude.
Oh, really, Zee?
When I was 10 years old, I had a kite.
Awesome kite.
I could fly it so high you couldn't see it.
One day, it crashed down.
I followed the string and it ended right over there across the street, right at the edge of his lawn.
Did he take your kite?
Yeah, he takes whatever lands on his lawn.
But that's not the point.
The point is, is that I saw him talking to his house and kissing it.
Besides everybody knows what he did to his wife.
Why?
What...?
What did he do to her?
- He ate her.
- Bones.
Get off.
Stop it!
- Bones, enough.
- Come on, Zee.
Bones, I'm so sick of you.
- I was just...
- You have no respect for women.
What?
What does that mean?
Get out.
Fine.
Prude.
What are you looking at?
Nebbercracker.
You really are dead, aren't you?
I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.
What are you gonna do about it, Nebbercracker?
Nebber-snapper-flipper-dipper...
My awesome kite.
Chowder.
Chowder.
Chowder?
Chowder.
Heat seeker.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Shut up.
What?
Nebbercracker's back from the dead.
- No way.
- Yeah.
They leave the keys in here.
You dare me?
Chowder, you're not listening to me.
Nebbercracker's haunting me, all right?
His blood is on my hands.
And now he's coming back for revenge.
You're really crazy right now.
Have you noticed that?
I think you're just freaking out because you killed a guy today.
Life goes on.
For you.
Try and relax.
Be cool, like me.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Make it stop.
Quit screwing around.
I need your help.
Fine.
You want my help?
- Yeah.
- I got three words for you:
"Trick or treat."
Okay.
Whatever.
Let's go.
Hold on.
Chowder, come on.
The haunting is subtle yet really, really boring.
- Can I go home now?
- Chowder, he'll hear you.
DJ this is why nobody will sit next to us at lunch.
I'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house and you'll see.
No ghost.
Chowder, stop, please.
Chowder, I'm serious.
Chowder, come back.
Come back here, please, Chowder.
Come on.
Chowder.
Come back.
- Oh, no.
A bottle.
- Chowder, put that down.
- Come back, please.
- Bottle.
Hey, DJ, who am I?
Get off my lawn.
Don't.
Come on.
Run.
Chowder, get out of there.
- Chowder, come here.
- Mommy.
This way.
This way.
Help.
Come on, Chowder!
Chowder, this way!
Don't look back.
I looked back.
Bones?
Coming.
Don't even think about crawling back here...
Trick or treat.
What?
Good morning, ma'am.
You witnessed a simulation of what you'll face this evening.
Studies show that households that run out of candy are 55 percent more likely to be TP'd.
To help avert this tragedy I'm here selling Halloween candy for my school, Westbrook Prep.
Good school.
I got kicked out of there.
Now, what do you want?
Just trying to get a head start on life and secure a successful future.
You want a successful future?
When a guy with tattoos comes up to the drive-through give him his burger, not your phone number.
Thank you for the advice.
I'll be sure to make a note of it.
But back to business.
Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.
Without candy, I'm afraid your house is a bull's-eye with shingles.
Nice try.
It's not my house.
Babysitter?
Okay, let's cut the crap.
Maybe the parents you work for left you $40 in emergency money.
Maybe they left me 30.
Maybe you give me 20, I write a receipt for 30 and you pocket 10.
Maybe.
And I want two extra bags of peanut clusters.
One bag and I'll toss in a licorice whip.
You're good.
Eight A.M. No detectable movement.
No detectable movement.
Hey, DJ, I brought you some chocolate.
Cover blown?
No detectable movement.
What are you two weirdoes up to?
Oh, nothing.
Just something in the house across the street just tried to eat us.
Yeah.
We've been watching all night.
We haven't even left this room once.
Not even to go to the bathroom.
Don't drink that.
Oh, gross.
Whatever disease you guys have I'm sure it's got letters and that they make pills for it.
Zee, it's true.
There's something evil going on across the street.
That's excellent.
I'm really happy for you.
Anyway, have you two astronomers seen Bones?
He left last night unexpectedly and he never came back.
Never came back?
- Bottle.
- Of course.
Oh, okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.
Listen, Zee, I don't know how to tell you this...
Your boyfriend has most likely been eaten alive.
Sherry Klausen.
I gotta go.
Breakfast.
Happy Halloween, losers.
Hello.
What?
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
Let me see.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- No.
No.
Hey.
- Hey, wait.
Hey.
DJ, that's your phone.
- No, stop.
- Girl.
Hey.
- Don't go in there.
- Hold it.
Don't go any further.
- Come here.
- Yes, over here.
Are you guys mentally challenged?
If you are, I'm certified to teach you baseball.
Detectable movement.
- What do we do?
What do we do?
- Come on.
Guys.
- Run, Chowder.
- I'm running.
Help, please.
- Got her.
- No, I got her.
Hello?
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.
There's an angry dad on the phone looking for the one called Chowder.
Hello?
Losers, I'm talking to you.
He's worried about you.
He should be.
- Start explaining.
- All right, the house, it tried to eat us.
- Stop explaining, I've had enough.
- Wait, wait, where are you going?
To see what's happening with that stupid house of yours.
- No, no, no.
You can't.
- What is your problem?
Puberty.
Yeah, I'm having lots and lots of puberty.
- No more Mountain Dew.
- Right.
I'm going to find Bones.
All right, you have fun.
Don't worry about us, we'll be fine.
And you tell him I said hey, okay?
Safe driving.
See you.
Oh, hi.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Oh, yeah.
I made the whole puberty thing up.
Hi, I'm JD.
DJ.
Yes, Dad, I meant to call you, but I forgot.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay.
Absolutely.
Affirmative.
- Okay, love you.
Bye.
- Yeah.
And this is our little observation post such as it were.
Yeah, posters are stupid.
I was gonna tear them down and put up some art.
Well, Dad, why don't you kiss my hairy butt?
Hey, DJ, you got any beer?
Well, hello there.
This is Chowder.
Charles, to the ladies.
Jenny Bennett.
Two-term class president at Westbrook Prep.
- That's a tough school to get into.
- Yeah, I got in, but decided not to go.
It's a girls' school.
Which is why I didn't.
You know, there's a...
There's a great taco stand near there.
I hate Mexican food.
- Me too.
- Me too.
Fascinating, isn't it?
Just sits there waiting mocking us with its houseness.
- May I please use your phone?
- Yeah, sure.
Here.
Who you calling?
- My mother.
- Rude.
She's probably not gonna believe you.
It's too much for the adult mind to comprehend.
Is this pee?
Because if it is, that's really gross.
- It's...
- DJ?
You pee in bottles?
What are you talking about?
That one's your pee.
- It's yours.
- It's his.
- May I speak with Allison?
- Unsanitary.
- Her daughter.
Thank you.
- It's his pee.
Excuse me.
I was selling chocolates in Mayville, and, well, it's kind of confusing.
So you hate Mexican food, huh?
Yeah.
You too, huh?
Yeah, in fact, you might say I started hating it first.
Outside in front of the house?
- Fine.
Let's get technical.
- Okay.
I started hating it through the telescope.
Can't call dibs on a girl through a telescope.
You can't call dibs on a girl.
- Just did.
- Me too.
She didn't believe me.
Authority can be so:
Okay.
Normally I don't spend time with guys like you.
But a house just tried to eat me, so you've got one hour.
Oh, a puppy.
Didn't see that coming.
Okay I think it's time to call the police.
Do you realize what's gonna happen tonight?
Hundreds of kids walking right up to that house.
Wait, wait, wait.
Come on.
Guys, I think we're overreacting.
Think about it.
Only a total moron would walk up to old man Nebbercracker's house.
- Hey, my ball.
- Chowder.
No.
It's gonna be a bloodbath.
Good news.
The cops are here.
All right, kids, this better be good.
I was in the forest wrestling with a bear claw when we got the call.
I was eating a doughnut.
All three of you, step to the car now.
- My ears.
- They're at the car.
He's a rookie.
First week on the job.
Officer, we have reason to believe there's a dangerous creature inside that house.
- It may have killed a man.
- And a dog.
Doggy down?
We've got a situation.
- We've got a situation.
- What are you doing?
Calling for backup.
Didn't you hear the kid?
There's a dangerous creature inside that house.
We don't have backup.
It's just Judy at the station.
And this is no situation.
It's just a couple Tater Tots hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.
I bet you the dead dog would beg to differ.
What was that?
Nothing.
All right.
Time's up, peewees.
- It's Halloween.
We got things to do.
- We do?
No, wait, you can't.
All right, this thing, it has a mouth and it comes out and grabs things and pulls them in and eats them.
Yeah, like this:
Okay, okay, okay.
The thing is we're trying to make this sound more real than it normally would.
Problem is it sounds kind of not real.
- So we'll see you later.
- No.
All right.
I'll show you.
But if things get out of hand...
We'll aim for Bigfoot.
That's loaded.
He's hopping.
Smart house.
Hey.
You...
Both of you.
Come here.
Bring it to the car.
Come on.
I'm gonna forget you throwing that rock because that dance was pretty funny.
But next time any of you mess with this guy's house all three of you are going in the hole, you got it?
Now, I'll give you 10 seconds to march.
But we need your help.
It's your job to help us.
- One.
- Come on.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
That's tender.
My house is right over there.
So much for relying on the government.
Yeah, I know.
I hate the government.
- Dude, we're screwed.
- No, we're not.
We'll go to an expert.
You're looking at the three-time, tri-state over-14 "Thou Art Dead" champion.
His name is Reginald Skulinski.
But they call him Skull.
- Who's "they"?
- Me and DJ.
- Yeah.
- He's the smartest guy on earth.
So let's go talk to him.
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny.
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on.
Hold up.
Skull is in the game zone right now.
You don't wanna mess with him when he's in the game zone.
Fine, so how long is he gonna be playing?
Die.
Die.
Who knows?
He once played for four days straight on one quarter, a gallon of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.
The man's a legend.
Well, if he's not coming out of the game zone, then we are going in.
- What?
Hey, what are you...?
- What?
Jenny, no.
It's like you're not gonna...
You're not gonna do it.
Like...
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die.
Watch out.
Did you see that?
I just chopped off your head again.
Your head's rolling.
You can't see it, your eyes are on your head.
- Sir?
- What?
I'm busy playing a video game without even looking at the screen.
What?
Old man Nebbercracker's house is possessed.
I need to know how to destroy it before it kills people.
Calm down.
You make me wanna throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.
Oh, you like the steel of my blade?
It's so cold.
Possessed house, you say?
In my travels to the video store and comic-book conventions I've seen many strange and wondrous things.
And I've heard tell of man-made structures becoming possessed by a human soul so that the spirit becomes merged with wood and brick creating a rare form of monster known as Domus mactabilis.
The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.
We're its murderous enemies.
Have fun getting killed.
Run, coward.
Look at that blood.
So how do we kill it?
You've gotta strike at the source of life: the heart.
But houses don't have hearts.
Yes!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You might be right about that.
Sorry, children, but I've got some very important business to take care of.
I won't be seeing you later.
Thou art dead.
So we need to strike at the heart.
Yeah, but where are we gonna find a heart inside a house?
Ever since Nebbercracker died there's been smoke coming out of that chimney.
The furnace.
The furnace is the heart.
If we wanna put out the fire, we're gonna have to go inside.
Without getting chewed to pieces.
- Dummy.
- Hey, I was just doodling.
No, Chowder, this is it.
First, we build a dummy.
We fill the dummy with a few gallons of cold medicine.
- Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy.
- Say what?
Feed the dummy to the house, house eats the medicine, goes to sleep.
- Look at this.
- We get in, douse the fire and get out.
- Questions?
- Yes, are you nuts?
I don't wanna steal drugs from my father I don't wanna go inside a monster and I don't wanna die.
- I say it's worth a shot.
- Yes, I agree, let's do it.
Hey, but I wanted that one.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Yes.
- Chowder.
Quiet.
- Sorry.
Go.
Whoopsie-daisy.
All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy, I'm gonna move you into position.
You don't be scared.
That's not how I trained you.
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.
Chowder, come on.
Okay.
Yes.
Trick or treat.
Plug it in.
So close.
Littering, loitering, vandalism, vagrancy...
- And treason.
- No, not treason.
- You sure?
Because in the book...
- I'm sure.
All right, kids, out of the trash cans.
Let's go.
Come on.
You heard the big guy.
You see the light.
Walk towards it.
Come on, keep it moving.
All right, drop your weapons.
Pass them to me.
Come on.
- I will shoot you.
- Well, lookie we got here.
You stay here, I'm checking this out.
I am on it.
Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me?
Huh, tough girl?
You disrespecting the badge?
You don't want none of this.
I'm telling you.
Test me.
Please.
Y'all wanna test me?
I am the police.
I know you're a thug.
Them brown eyes...
I see it in your eyes.
That's it.
That is it.
You got something to say, Porky, huh?
- That's it, we're taking them in.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Where we taking them?
- To jail.
Let's go.
You hear that?
You guys are going to jail.
But, officer, you've gotta believe us.
Yeah, 2-percent, you got the right to shut up.
- Okay, the house is a monster.
- And to think I believed you.
Hey, listen, I'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.
I mean, kind of a cop.
He has a gun.
Yeah.
They're gonna love you downtown, Jughead.
We are supercops.
Yeah.
That's why I live in a condo.
Supercop.
Super-duper-duper-cop.
Super...
- You hear that?
- That's my stomach.
I'm starving.
No, no.
That sounds like the dangerous creature.
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Oh, my gosh.
This is like trying to wrangle a puppy.
All right, I'll be back.
- You guys, stop.
- Hey, guys.
- No.
Get out of there.
- No, don't go in there.
What?
I tell you.
Super-roll.
- Stop.
Stop.
- Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
You don't know what's up with that house.
Where you at, spooky creature?
I'm gonna find you.
Freeze tree.
Hey, what you doing?
You can't do that.
Not to an officer, brother.
That is illegal.
- I'm coming, buddy.
- Put me down!
- I'm gonna go get backup.
- I thought there was no backup.
I'm getting Judy.
Judy!
Help!
Mama!
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
- I think I'm having a stroke.
- Just try to stay calm, okay?
We'll be all right if we just stay calm.
I'm too young to die!
Jenny.
I've always loved you.
- Chowder!
- Sorry.
Mama!
I can't look.
Guys, come on.
Let's go.
We're dead.
You've killed us and now we're dead.
I don't think the house knows that we're in here.
I bet it thinks we're still in the car.
Listen.
It sounds like it's sleeping.
The only way that we're gonna get out of here alive is if we find the heart, we put out the fire.
Maybe we should examine our other options.
Sure.
Other option:
We wait here and do nothing until it wakes up and eats us.
Find the heart, put out the fire.
Got it.
Explosives.
That's so cool.
- He was watching me.
- DJ.
Did you ever see a wife?
People used to say he had one but he fattened her up and he ate her.
"Demolition squad."
Sorry.
Come on.
Be quiet.
Don't worry, I have a very light step.
There.
Right there.
Shoot it.
What?
I thought if I shot the heart, that...
- That's not the heart.
- Then what is it?
Well, if those are the teeth and that's the tongue then that must be the uvula.
So it's a girl house.
What?
No.
It stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.
Not me.
No.
Okay.
Let's move.
We need to move quickly and quietly.
Don't touch anything.
And stay together...
- DJ!
- Wait.
DJ.
I'll save you.
Chowder, knock it off.
Sorry.
I thought you were...
DJ!
- Chowder, it's a toy.
- Oh, yeah.
Where's DJ?
- DJ.
- Over here.
Look at all these toys.
This must be where Nebbercracker kept his stash.
"Stash."
I think you guys should have a look at this.
- The key.
- Come on, we don't have time for this.
Yeah, we've gotta find a way out of here.
What are you doing?
We have a Ping-Pong table in our basement.
Constance.
Holy moly.
He really did eat her.
Couldn't have.
Her whole body is buried in cement.
Look at all this stuff.
Why would he build her a shrine if he murdered her?
Maybe he just felt guilty or something.
DJ, can we please get out of here?
I always knew you were hiding something, Mr. Nebbercracker.
DJ.
Way to go, big nose.
- It's awake.
- Run!
Hide.
Hey, I know that sound.
My ball.
Where are you going?
Come here.
- Chowder, come back.
- You get back here.
Gotcha.
Killer Slinkys!
- Chowder.
- Leave me alone!
DJ!
Help!
Oh, no.
Get off.
Jenny.
Chowder.
Come on, Chowder, grab on.
Gotcha.
DJ, look out!
No!
The uvula.
- DJ...
- Chowder.
Mommy!
Gross.
Did we just get upchucked?
The uvula, nature's emergency exit.
That's it.
Another great idea, DJ.
Brilliant.
What do you want from me, Chowder?
I don't see you coming up with any big ideas.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Do you wanna hear my big idea?
I'm going home to make a pretzel sandwich.
See you.
Chowder, the house is still alive and you're gonna wuss out?
I risked my life for you.
I stole drugs for you and I could've died in there.
- Yeah, me too.
You're the one that killed Nebbercracker in the first place.
- Getting your ball back.
- You guys.
Stop fighting.
You're acting like babies.
We are babies.
What were we thinking?
We tried to put a house to sleep with cold medicine.
- How lame can you get?
- Where are you going?
I'm going home.
I suck.
DJ.
At least it's an ambulance.
DJ?
It's a ghost.
Begone.
Fie.
Begone yourself.
Get away.
He's not a ghost.
He's not dead.
I'm not a murderer.
Of course I'm not dead.
Who said I was dead?
You'll be dead if you don't scram.
- Come on, DJ.
- Let's hurry.
Don't you know what day this is?
I'm running out of time.
I'm running out of time.
Honey I'm home.
Oh, look at you, dear.
Your shingles are all ruffled and your windows are cracked.
Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart.
It's no problem at all.
It's her.
The house is her.
- DJ, what are you doing?
- Wait.
Come on.
- Come back.
- Where you going?
Nothing paint and varnish can't handle.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know about Constance.
You what?
What do you know?
You don't know anything.
You were in my house?
You...
You didn't kill her, did you?
I love her so much.
Hello?
It's okay.
I can take you away from here.
Would you like that?
Yes.
There we go.
Won't be long now.
All right.
Okay, open your eyes.
- Now, it's not much, I know, but just...
- Darling.
Get away from my house!
I'm gonna rip them to bits.
Help.
- Constance.
- Help.
Help.
- What's wrong?
Are you hurt?
- Hurt?
Yes, I'm hurt.
Those criminals are attacking our house.
- Trick or treat.
- Now, now they're just kids, dear.
- It's Halloween.
- No, no, no.
It's my house, and they're hurting me.
Constance, look at me.
Look at me.
As long as I'm here, I will never let anyone hurt you.
- Constance.
- Sucker.
You vandals.
- Eat this.
- You hooligans.
- I'll get you.
- Constance, no!
So I finished the house.
She would've wanted that.
She died, but she didn't leave.
And that night that one night of every year I had to take precautions.
- Trick or treat.
- I had to.
- Sucker.
- I had to.
Hey!
Get a...
Stay away from my house!
She attacks anyone who comes near.
Go.
I'm coming, dear.
Go.
No, no, no, wait.
I can't let you do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know that you've been protecting us all these years.
But now it's our turn to protect you.
Let her go.
But if I let her go then I'll have no one.
That's not true.
Constance, no!
Come on.
The house is alive!
This way.
This way.
Come on.
You guys, come on.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to slow the house down.
Move it, pork chop.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Mr. Nebbercracker.
Come on.
I can't.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Hurry.
Go on.
I'll be all right.
Oh, man.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
You stay away from those children, Constance!
Constance.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, now...
There, there, girl.
My sweet.
You've been a bad girl, haven't you?
You've hurt people.
Oh, Constance.
Oh, we've always known this day would come.
Haven't we?
I have to make things right.
I have to make things right.
Constance.
I've always done what's best for you, haven't I?
Haven't I, girl?
Come on, let's move.
Oh, Constance.
Let this be the right thing to do.
Leave him alone!
Yeah, get your grubby branches off the old man!
Take that!
And that!
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, kid, come here.
- Take this.
- What?
You have to help me.
Please.
I know you can do it.
Go on.
Go.
Hurry.
How do you know how to drive this thing?
I don't.
The chimney.
The chimney leads to the heart.
Jenny!
Jenny.
Are you all right?
I'm not sure.
DJ, get rid of that thing.
I'm working on it.
Chowder, I need you to get the house down under that crane.
Think you could do that?
Piece of cake.
Come on.
You think you can just mess with my friends?
DJ, look.
Mommy.
Chowder.
Come in, Chowder.
Chowder, buddy?
Hey, guys.
Look who just won.
It's me, the screw-up.
Way to go, Chowder, you did it!
Look at me.
Look at Chowder.
Oh, yeah.
- Sorry.
- Guys, come on.
Yes.
Look at me.
You can't do that.
That's not fair.
No.
Get on the top.
Help!
That's it, Chowder.
Keep her coming.
You ain't nothing.
You're a shack.
You're an outhouse.
No!
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Go.
I kissed a girl.
I kissed a girl on the lips.
Guys.
Any time now.
Sorry.
DJ, hurry.
I'm flying!
- On three, light the dynamite.
- Okay, I got it.
- One.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Two.
- Yes.
Thr...
DJ!
Three!
Do you guys hear something?
It's over there.
Come on.
Oh, my dear.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry, Mr. Nebbercracker, about your house and your wife.
Your house-wife.
Forty-five years.
We have been trapped for 45 years.
And now we're free.
We're free.
Thank you, friend.
Thank you all.
We're free.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
Next.
What happened to Nebbercracker's house?
It turned into a monster, so I blew it up.
Trick or treat.
We're gonna need a tricycle.
One tricycle, coming up.
Tricycle.
Tricycle.
- Tricycle.
- Hello, tricycle.
I missed you so much.
- Thank you, mister.
- Goodbye, now.
- Happy Halloween.
- Come on.
- Mom.
There's my mom.
- Jenny!
- One second.
- Okay.
So...
We should hang out again.
Soon.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
See you.
Good luck with the puberty.
She grabbed my butt.
That's nice, Chowder.
Hey, Mr. Nebbercracker.
It's time to go.
Oh, you go on.
I've got some work to do.
All right.
Thanks.
- I'll see you around.
- All right.
Bye.
Hey.
Stay off my lawn.
I'm just kidding.
- You think he'll be okay?
- Yeah.
He'll be fine.
He'll go on vacation, get some color, maybe he'll meet someone new.
This time, maybe a nice beach house.
Hey, DJ, look who's here.
- Yes, I can see that, thank you.
- No biggie.
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, Dad.
What the heck kind...?
No, don't tell me.
Let me guess.
It's...
- Dirty pirates?
- That's it.
Dirty pirates.
Fun, fun.
Oh, you look adorable.
Have fun tonight.
You know, you were right.
We're definitely too old for trick-or-treating.
Oh, yeah.
No question about it.
On the other hand we've been working all night.
Candy time?
Candy time.
We're back.
Yes.
Candy.
- Did we just get...?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's Halloween, right?
What do you say you and I go out and "inspect" some candy, huh?
We should go eat some candy too.
That's a good idea.
Okay.
All right.
Let's go eat some candy.
Lots of yummy candy.
Like carrots.
All right, where's the car?
And that is how I slayed that mystical dragon.
Oh, yeah?
That's great.
Come on, baby.
We're out of here.
Not so fast, Bones.
Times have changed.
Skull's not like you.
He gives me the respect I deserve and makes time for me.
Whatever.
Bones!
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Get off my lawn!
Trespasser.
Do you want to be eaten alive?
-No.
-Then get out of here!
My trike.
Stay away from my house!
-DJ!
-We're gonna be late.
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming.
I'm coming.
October 30th: another tricycle.
I'm coming.
Mom.
Mom, he did it again.
He took another tricycle.
Okay, honey, we've talked about this.
You cannot stay up in your room all day staring at an old man through a telescope.
But, Mom, there's something wrong with that house.
I'm serious.
What was that?
I'm serious.
His voice sounds funny.
Someone is hitting puberty.
"What's happening to my body?" Right, buddy?
Maybe you should come with us.
Oh, the boy's too busy.
He's got his spying to do.
I'm not spying.
Well....
"Well...." That's okay, buddy.
When I was your age, I did exactly the same thing.
Of course, it was with binoculars and involved the lovely Jensen twins.
Neither of which was as lovely as your beautiful mother.
Will you be an angel and help me bring out the incisor?
-The incisor.
-Hold this.
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.
Elizabeth will be here in a few hours.
If anything happens, call the police and hide.
He knows that.
See you tomorrow night.
-What have you done?
-Just let me drive this thing, will you?
-Where is DJ?
Where's DJ?
-l'm fine.
You would be so happy if he was under the car, wouldn't you?
Sorry. lt's hard to see with the mask on.
Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder?
Why did you put up your window?
-Chowder.
-lt's aerodynamic.
-Hi, DJ.
-We've got to make time.
The children.
The children.
-What children?
-Bye-bye, baby.
-Tell him you love him, dear.
-He knows that.
-Tell your son you love him.
-l don't wanna tell him.
-He knows I love him.
-He's your son.
-You have to say it.
Roll it down.
-We're gonna be late.
We both love you.
-That includes your dad.
-That's right.
-He's had enough kisses.
-Blow him a kiss.
-Blow him a kiss.
-Goodbye.
Cheer up.
It's almost Halloween.
In one day and three hours, it's candy time.
Okay?
-Check it out, I got a new ball.
-Cool.
Oh, speaking of which, have you decided?
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?
Chowder.
I don't think I'm going trick-or-treating this year.
What?
Come on, you're gonna break a six-year streak.
Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.
Maybe I'm getting too grown-up.
Three seconds on the clock.
I'm playing basketball.
It's time for an in-your-face disgrace.
-Are you okay?
-My nose is in my brains.
Let me see.
Oh, my God.
-What?
-You're a dork.
Where's my ball?
Oh, no.
-Sorry, man.
-Wait, wait.
DJ.
You're a grownup now, you go get it.
Chowder, your ball just landed on Nebbercracker's lawn.
It doesn't exist anymore.
I paid $28 for that ball.
I raked 10 yards and asked my mom for a dollar 26 times.
I never worked that hard in my life--
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.
-So?
-So maybe he's sleeping.
All right, I'll do it.
I'll never forget this.
Hurry, though.
Go.
You.
-No.
-DJ, run!
Get the ball and run!
You're so close.
What have you done?
-Just nudge it over here.
-l'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I didn't mean--
You are dead.
DJ, come on, come on!
-Chowder.
-Come on, DJ.
Help.
Chowder.
Help.
Help.
-You think you can terrorize my lawn?
-No, I'm sorry.
-You wanna be a dead person?
-No. I love life.
This place is not a playground for children.
-Got it from now on.
-This is my house!
Why can't you respect that?
Why can't you just stay away from--?
Push.
No siren.
Never a good sign.
I'm a murderer.
-No, you're not.
-l'm not?
When it's an accident, they call it manslaughter.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Great.
Babysitter's here.
See you, DJ.
Perfect.
DJ.
Hey, DJ, I just saw an ambulance.
Did I miss anything interesting?
Hello?
Elizabeth can I talk to you about something?
Oh, yeah, of course you can, cantaloupe.
We are gonna have the bestest time.
-Got tons of neat activities planned.
-They already left.
-They did?
They're gone?
-Yes, and I need to talk to you.
So the usual deal: indoors by 9, in your room by 11 .
-Lights out, your call.
-Elizabeth.
-And it's Zee.
-"Zee"?
Now, listen up. I control the TV, the stereo and the phone.
I don't do board games, Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.
I'm not your mother.
I'm not your friend.
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay?
I am practically a grownup.
I don't even need you here, Elizabeth.
-Gosh, DJ, why'd you break that?
-But I didn't.
Yeah, let me ask you something.
Who are they gonna believe?
-Go to your room.
-Fine.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, very funny.
See how you like it.
Happy Halloween, doofus.
Nice one, Bones.
Look at his face.
That's funny.
You're not supposed to have friends over.
Who's this?
-This is Bones.
-What's up?
-He's in a band.
-That's right.
And, anyway, cantaloupe, let's not open up the rulebook, okay?
Since you're up way past your bedtime.
No, no, no, this is different.
Listen.
You called the neighbors.
Good for you.
I used star-69.
He called me.
-Who called you?
-Nebbercracker.
P.S., he died today.
-You lie.
-Do not.
He died, and now I'm getting phone calls from his house.
A phone call from beyond the grave.
Guys, come on. I'm serious.
Oh, he's serious.
Did you know he was serious?
-Come on, man, give her back.
-Oh, "her"?
You mind?
Oh, come on.
Gross.
-Come on, Bones.
-Wait, hold on, dude. I th--
She's having trouble breathing.
Might have something in her throat.
All right, I'll look into it.
-No.
Elizabeth.
No.
-Okay, Bones, knock it off.
Downstairs, now.
Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.
You are so funny.
I know. lt's like I don't even try and it just happens.
God, stop doing this.
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do?
-Homicide.
-Chowder, where are your parents?
My dad's at the pharmacy and my mom's at the movies with her personal trainer.
-Meet me at the Danger Zone now.
-Fine.
-Bones, I said, knock it off.
-Come on, man.
No, I'm creeped out.
You know, I saw an ambulance here today.
So?
So maybe Nebbercracker really did die.
We should be so lucky.
The guy is evil.
No, he's just a crotchety old dude.
Oh, really, Zee?
When I was 10 years old, I had a kite.
Awesome kite.
I could fly it so high you couldn't see it.
One day, it crashed down.
I followed the string and it ended right over there across the street, right at the edge of his lawn.
Did he take your kite?
Yeah, he takes whatever lands on his lawn.
But that's not the point.
The point is, is that I saw him talking to his house and kissing it.
Besides everybody knows what he did to his wife.
Why?
What--?
What did he do to her?
-He ate her.
-Bones.
Get off.
Stop it!
-Bones, enough.
-Come on, Zee.
Bones, I'm so sick of you.
-l was just--
-You have no respect for women.
What?
What does that mean?
Get out.
Fine.
Prude.
What are you looking at?
Nebbercracker.
You really are dead, aren't you?
I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.
What are you gonna do about it, Nebbercracker?
Nebber-snapper-flipper-dipper--
My awesome kite.
Chowder.
Chowder.
Chowder?
Chowder.
Heat seeker.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Shut up.
What?
Nebbercracker's back from the dead.
-No way.
-Yeah.
They leave the keys in here.
You dare me?
Chowder, you're not listening to me.
Nebbercracker's haunting me, all right?
His blood is on my hands.
And now he's coming back for revenge.
You're really crazy right now.
Have you noticed that?
I think you're just freaking out because you killed a guy today.
Life goes on.
For you.
Try and relax.
Be cool, like me.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Make it stop.
Quit screwing around.
I need your help.
Fine.
You want my help?
-Yeah.
-l got three words for you:
"Trick or treat."
Okay.
Whatever.
Let's go.
Hold on.
Chowder, come on.
The haunting is subtle yet really, really boring.
-Can I go home now?
-Chowder, he'll hear you.
DJ this is why nobody will sit next to us at lunch.
I'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house and you'll see.
No ghost.
Chowder, stop, please.
Chowder, I'm serious.
Chowder, come back.
Come back here, please, Chowder.
Come on.
Chowder.
Come back.
-Oh, no.
A bottle.
-Chowder, put that down.
-Come back, please.
-Bottle.
Hey, DJ, who am I?
Get off my lawn.
Don't.
Come on.
Run.
Chowder, get out of there.
-Chowder, come here.
-Mommy.
This way.
This way.
Help.
Come on, Chowder!
Chowder, this way!
Don't look back.
I looked back.
Bones?
Coming.
Don't even think about crawling back here....
Trick or treat.
What?
Good morning, ma'am.
You witnessed a simulation of what you'll face this evening.
Studies show that households that run out of candy are 55 percent more likely to be TP'd.
To help avert this tragedy I'm here selling Halloween candy for my school, Westbrook Prep.
Good school.
I got kicked out of there.
Now, what do you want?
Just trying to get a head start on life and secure a successful future.
You want a successful future?
When a guy with tattoos comes up to the drive-through give him his burger, not your phone number.
Thank you for the advice.
I'll be sure to make a note of it.
But back to business.
Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.
Without candy, I'm afraid your house is a bull's-eye with shingles.
Nice try. lt's not my house.
Babysitter?
Okay, let's cut the crap.
Maybe the parents you work for left you $40 in emergency money.
Maybe they left me 30.
Maybe you give me 20, I write a receipt for 30 and you pocket 10.
Maybe.
And I want two extra bags of peanut clusters.
One bag and I'll toss in a licorice whip.
You're good.
Eight a.m. No detectable movement.
No detectable movement.
Hey, DJ, I brought you some chocolate.
Cover blown?
No detectable movement.
What are you two weirdoes up to?
Oh, nothing.
Just something in the house across the street just tried to eat us.
Yeah.
We've been watching all night.
We haven't even left this room once.
Not even to go to the bathroom.
Don't drink that.
Oh, gross.
Whatever disease you guys have I'm sure it's got letters and that they make pills for it.
Zee, it's true.
There's something evil going on across the street.
That's excellent.
I'm really happy for you.
Anyway, have you two astronomers seen Bones?
He left last night unexpectedly and he never came back.
Never came back?
-Bottle.
-Of course.
Oh, okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.
Listen, Zee, I don't know how to tell you this--
Your boyfriend has most likely been eaten alive.
Sherry Klausen.
I gotta go.
Breakfast.
Happy Halloween, losers.
Hello.
What?
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
Let me see.
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.
-No.
No.
Hey.
-Hey, wait.
Hey.
DJ, that's your phone.
-No, stop.
-Girl.
Hey.
-Don't go in there.
-Hold it.
Don't go any further.
-Come here.
-Yes, over here.
Are you guys mentally challenged?
If you are, I'm certified to teach you baseball.
Detectable movement.
-What do we do?
What do we do?
-Come on.
Guys.
-Run, Chowder.
-l'm running.
Help, please.
-Got her.
-No, I got her.
Hello?
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.
There's an angry dad on the phone looking for the one called Chowder.
Hello?
Losers, I'm talking to you.
He's worried about you.
He should be.
-Start explaining.
-All right, the house, it tried to eat us.
-Stop explaining, I've had enough.
-Wait, wait, where are you going?
To see what's happening with that stupid house of yours.
-No, no, no.
You can't.
-What is your problem?
Puberty.
Yeah, I'm having lots and lots of puberty.
-No more Mountain Dew.
-Right.
I'm going to find Bones.
All right, you have fun.
Don't worry about us, we'll be fine.
And you tell him I said hey, okay?
Safe driving.
See you.
Oh, hi.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Oh, yeah. I made the whole puberty thing up.
Hi, I'm JD.
DJ.
Yes, Dad, I meant to call you, but I forgot.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay.
Absolutely.
Affirmative.
-Okay, love you.
Bye.
-Yeah.
And this is our little observation post such as it were.
Yeah, posters are stupid.
I was gonna tear them down and put up some art.
Well, Dad, why don't you kiss my hairy butt?
Hey, DJ, you got any beer?
Well, hello there.
This is Chowder.
Charles, to the ladies.
Jenny Bennett.
Two-term class president at Westbrook Prep.
-That's a tough school to get into.
-Yeah, I got in, but decided not to go.
It's a girls' school.
Which is why I didn't.
You know, there's a....
There's a great taco stand near there.
I hate Mexican food.
-Me too.
-Me too.
Fascinating, isn't it?
Just sits there waiting mocking us with its houseness.
-May I please use your phone?
-Yeah, sure.
Here.
Who you calling?
-My mother.
-Rude.
She's probably not gonna believe you.
It's too much for the adult mind to comprehend.
is this pee?
Because if it is, that's really gross.
-lt's--
-DJ?
You pee in bottles?
What are you talking about?
That one's your pee.
-lt's yours.
-lt's his.
-May I speak with Allison?
-Unsanitary.
-Her daughter.
Thank you.
-lt's his pee.
Excuse me.
I was selling chocolates in Mayville, and, well, it's kind of confusing.
So you hate Mexican food, huh?
Yeah.
You too, huh?
Yeah, in fact, you might say I started hating it first.
Outside in front of the house?
-Fine.
Let's get technical.
-Okay.
I started hating it through the telescope.
Can't call dibs on a girl through a telescope.
You can't call dibs on a girl.
-Just did.
-Me too.
She didn't believe me.
Authority can be so:
Okay.
Normally I don't spend time with guys like you.
But a house just tried to eat me, so you've got one hour.
Oh, a puppy.
Didn't see that coming.
Okay I think it's time to call the police.
Do you realize what's gonna happen tonight?
Hundreds of kids walking right up to that house.
Wait, wait, wait.
Come on.
Guys, I think we're overreacting.
Think about it.
Only a total moron would walk up to old man Nebbercracker's house.
-Hey, my ball.
-Chowder.
No.
It's gonna be a bloodbath.
Good news.
The cops are here.
All right, kids, this better be good.
I was in the forest wrestling with a bear claw when we got the call.
I was eating a doughnut.
All three of you, step to the car now.
-My ears.
-They're at the car.
He's a rookie.
First week on the job.
Officer, we have reason to believe there's a dangerous creature inside that house.
-lt may have killed a man.
-And a dog.
Doggy down?
We've got a situation.
-We've got a situation.
-What are you doing?
Calling for backup.
Didn't you hear the kid?
There's a dangerous creature inside that house.
We don't have backup.
It's just Judy at the station.
And this is no situation.
It's just a couple Tater Tots hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.
I bet you the dead dog would beg to differ.
What was that?
Nothing.
All right.
Time's up, peewees.
-lt's Halloween.
We got things to do.
-We do?
No, wait, you can't.
All right, this thing, it has a mouth and it comes out and grabs things and pulls them in and eats them.
Yeah, like this:
Okay, okay, okay.
The thing is we're trying to make this sound more real than it normally would.
Problem is it sounds kind of not real.
-So we'll see you later.
-No.
All right. I'll show you.
But if things get out of hand....
We'll aim for Bigfoot.
That's loaded.
He's hopping.
Smart house.
Hey.
You-
- Both of you.
Come here.
Bring it to the car.
Come on.
I'm gonna forget you throwing that rock because that dance was pretty funny.
But next time any of you mess with this guy's house all three of you are going in the hole, you got it?
Now, I'll give you 10 seconds to march.
But we need your help.
It's your job to help us.
-One.
-Come on.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
That's tender.
My house is right over there.
So much for relying on the government.
Yeah, I know.
I hate the government.
-Dude, we're screwed.
-No, we're not.
We'll go to an expert.
You're looking at the three-time, tri-state over-14 "Thou Art Dead" champion.
His name is Reginald Skulinski.
But they call him Skull.
-Who's "they"?
-Me and DJ.
-Yeah.
-He's the smartest guy on earth.
So let's go talk to him.
-Hey, Jenny, Jenny.
-Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on.
Hold up.
Skull is in the game zone right now.
You don't wanna mess with him when he's in the game zone.
Fine, so how long is he gonna be playing?
Die.
Die.
Who knows?
He once played for four days straight on one quarter, a gallon of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.
The man's a legend.
Well, if he's not coming out of the game zone, then we are going in.
-What?
Hey, what are you--?
-What?
Jenny, no.
It's like you're not gonna-- You're not gonna do it.
Like--
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die.
Watch out.
Did you see that?
I just chopped off your head again.
Your head's rolling.
You can't see it, your eyes are on your head.
-Sir?
-What?
I'm busy playing a video game without even looking at the screen.
What?
Old man Nebbercracker's house is possessed.
I need to know how to destroy it before it kills people.
Calm down.
You make me wanna throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.
Oh, you like the steel of my blade?
It's so cold.
Possessed house, you say?
In my travels to the video store and comic-book conventions I've seen many strange and wondrous things.
And I've heard tell of man-made structures becoming possessed by a human soul so that the spirit becomes merged with wood and brick creating a rare form of monster known as Domus mactabilis.
The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.
We're its murderous enemies.
Have fun getting killed.
Run, coward.
Look at that blood.
So how do we kill it?
You've gotta strike at the source of life: the heart.
But houses don't have hearts.
Yes!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You might be right about that.
Sorry, children, but I've got some very important business to take care of.
I won't be seeing you later.
Thou art dead.
So we need to strike at the heart.
Yeah, but where are we gonna find a heart inside a house?
Ever since Nebbercracker died there's been smoke coming out of that chimney.
The furnace.
The furnace is the heart.
If we wanna put out the fire, we're gonna have to go inside.
Without getting chewed to pieces.
-Dummy.
-Hey, I was just doodling.
No, Chowder, this is it.
First, we build a dummy.
We fill the dummy with a few gallons of cold medicine.
-Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy.
-Say what?
Feed the dummy to the house, house eats the medicine, goes to sleep.
-Look at this.
-We get in, douse the fire and get out.
-Questions?
-Yes, are you nuts?
I don't wanna steal drugs from my father I don't wanna go inside a monster and I don't wanna die.
-l say it's worth a shot.
-Yes, I agree, let's do it.
Hey, but I wanted that one.
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-Yes.
-Chowder.
Quiet.
-Sorry.
Go.
Whoopsie-daisy.
All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy, I'm gonna move you into position.
You don't be scared.
That's not how I trained you.
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.
Chowder, come on.
Okay.
Yes.
Trick or treat.
Plug it in.
So close.
Littering, loitering, vandalism, vagrancy--
-And treason.
-No, not treason.
-You sure?
Because in the book-- -l'm sure.
All right, kids, out of the trash cans.
Let's go.
Come on.
You heard the big guy.
You see the light.
Walk towards it.
Come on, keep it moving.
All right, drop your weapons.
Pass them to me.
Come on.
-l will shoot you.
-Well, lookie we got here.
You stay here, I'm checking this out.
I am on it.
Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me?
Huh, tough girl?
You disrespecting the badge?
You don't want none of this.
I'm telling you.
Test me.
Please.
Y'all wanna test me?
I am the police.
I know you're a thug.
Them brown eyes....
l see it in your eyes.
That's it.
That is it.
You got something to say, Porky, huh?
-That's it, we're taking them in.
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Where we taking them?
-To jail.
Let's go.
You hear that?
You guys are going to jail.
But, officer, you've gotta believe us.
Yeah, 2-percent, you got the right to shut up.
-Okay, the house is a monster.
-And to think I believed you.
Hey, listen, I'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.
I mean, kind of a cop.
He has a gun.
Yeah.
They're gonna love you downtown, Jughead.
We are supercops.
Yeah.
That's why I live in a condo.
Supercop.
Super-duper-duper-cop.
Super--
-You hear that?
-That's my stomach. I'm starving.
No, no.
That sounds like the dangerous creature.
-l'm gonna go check it out.
-Oh, my gosh.
This is like trying to wrangle a puppy.
All right, I'll be back.
-You guys, stop.
-Hey, guys.
-No.
Get out of there.
-No, don't go in there.
What?
I tell you.
Super-roll.
-Stop.
Stop.
-Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
You don't know what's up with that house.
Where you at, spooky creature?
I'm gonna find you.
Freeze tree.
Hey, what you doing?
You can't do that.
Not to an officer, brother.
That is illegal.
-l'm coming, buddy.
-Put me down!
-l'm gonna go get backup.
-l thought there was no backup.
I'm getting Judy.
Judy!
Help!
Mama!
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
-l think I'm having a stroke.
-Just try to stay calm, okay?
We'll be all right if we just stay calm.
I'm too young to die!
Jenny. I've always loved you.
-Chowder!
-Sorry.
Mama!
I can't look.
Guys, come on.
Let's go.
We're dead.
You've killed us and now we're dead.
I don't think the house knows that we're in here.
I bet it thinks we're still in the car.
Listen.
It sounds like it's sleeping.
The only way that we're gonna get out of here alive is if we find the heart, we put out the fire.
Maybe we should examine our other options.
Sure.
Other option:
We wait here and do nothing until it wakes up and eats us.
Find the heart, put out the fire.
Got it.
Explosives.
That's so cool.
-He was watching me.
-DJ.
Did you ever see a wife?
People used to say he had one but he fattened her up and he ate her.
"Demolition squad."
Sorry.
Come on.
Be quiet.
Don't worry, I have a very light step.
There.
Right there.
Shoot it.
What?
I thought if I shot the heart, that--
-That's not the heart.
-Then what is it?
Well, if those are the teeth and that's the tongue then that must be the uvula.
So it's a girl house.
What?
No.
It stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.
Not me.
No.
Okay.
Let's move.
We need to move quickly and quietly.
Don't touch anything.
And stay together--
-DJ!
-Wait.
DJ.
I'll save you.
Chowder, knock it off.
Sorry. I thought you were-
- DJ!
-Chowder, it's a toy.
-Oh, yeah.
Where's DJ?
-DJ.
-Over here.
Look at all these toys.
This must be where Nebbercracker kept his stash.
"Stash."
I think you guys should have a look at this.
-The key.
-Come on, we don't have time for this.
Yeah, we've gotta find a way out of here.
What are you doing?
We have a Ping-Pong table in our basement.
Constance.
Holy moly.
He really did eat her.
Couldn't have.
Her whole body is buried in cement.
Look at all this stuff.
Why would he build her a shrine if he murdered her?
Maybe he just felt guilty or something.
DJ, can we please get out of here?
I always knew you were hiding something, Mr. Nebbercracker.
DJ.
Way to go, big nose.
-lt's awake.
-Run!
Hide.
Hey, I know that sound.
My ball.
Where are you going?
Come here.
-Chowder, come back.
-You get back here.
Gotcha.
Killer Slinkys!
-Chowder.
-Leave me alone!
DJ!
Help!
Oh, no.
Get off.
Jenny.
Chowder.
Come on, Chowder, grab on.
Gotcha.
DJ, look out!
No!
The uvula.
-DJ--
-Chowder.
Mommy!
Gross.
Did we just get upchucked?
The uvula, nature's emergency exit.
That's it.
Another great idea, DJ.
Brilliant.
What do you want from me, Chowder?
I don't see you coming up with any big ideas.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Do you wanna hear my big idea?
I'm going home to make a pretzel sandwich.
See you.
Chowder, the house is still alive and you're gonna wuss out?
I risked my life for you.
I stole drugs for you...
-...and I could've died in there.
-Yeah, me too.
You're the one that killed Nebbercracker in the first place.
-Getting your ball back.
-You guys.
Stop fighting.
You're acting like babies.
We are babies.
What were we thinking?
We tried to put a house to sleep with cold medicine.
-How lame can you get?
-Where are you going?
I'm going home. I suck.
DJ.
At least it's an ambulance.
DJ?
It's a ghost.
Begone.
Fie.
Begone yourself.
Get away.
He's not a ghost.
He's not dead. I'm not a murderer.
Of course I'm not dead.
Who said I was dead?
You'll be dead if you don't scram.
-Come on, DJ.
-Let's hurry.
Don't you know what day this is?
I'm running out of time.
I'm running out of time.
Honey I'm home.
Oh, look at you, dear.
Your shingles are all ruffled and your windows are cracked.
Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart.
It's no problem at all.
It's her.
The house is her.
-DJ, what are you doing?
-Wait.
Come on.
-Come back.
-Where you going?
Nothing paint and varnish can't handle.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know about Constance.
You what?
What do you know?
You don't know anything.
You were in my house?
You--
You didn't kill her, did you?
I love her so much.
Hello?
It's okay.
I can take you away from here.
Would you like that?
Yes.
There we go.
Won't be long now.
All right.
Okay, open your eyes.
-Now, it's not much, I know, but just--
-Darling.
Get away from my house!
I'm gonna rip them to bits.
Help.
-Constance.
-Help.
Help.
-What's wrong?
Are you hurt?
-Hurt?
Yes, I'm hurt.
Those criminals are attacking our house.
-Trick or treat.
-Now, now they're just kids, dear.
-lt's Halloween.
-No, no, no.
It's my house, and they're hurting me.
Constance, look at me.
Look at me.
As long as I'm here, I will never let anyone hurt you.
-Constance.
-Sucker.
You vandals.
-Eat this.
-You hooligans.
-l'll get you.
-Constance, no!
So I finished the house.
She would've wanted that.
She died, but she didn't leave.
And that night that one night of every year I had to take precautions.
-Trick or treat.
-I had to.
-Sucker.
-I had to.
Hey!
Get a--
Stay away from my house!
She attacks anyone who comes near.
Go.
I'm coming, dear.
Go.
No, no, no, wait. I can't let you do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know that you've been protecting us all these years.
But now it's our turn to protect you.
Let her go.
But if I let her go then I'll have no one.
That's not true.
Constance, no!
Come on.
The house is alive!
This way.
This way.
Come on.
You guys, come on.
-What are you doing?
-Trying to slow the house down.
Move it, pork chop.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Mr. Nebbercracker.
Come on.
I can't.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Hurry.
Go on. I'll be all right.
Oh, man.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
You stay away from those children, Constance!
Constance.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, now....
There, there, girl.
My sweet.
You've been a bad girl, haven't you?
You've hurt people.
Oh, Constance.
Oh, we've always known this day would come.
Haven't we?
I have to make things right.
I have to make things right.
Constance.
I've always done what's best for you, haven't I?
Haven't I, girl?
Come on, let's move.
Oh, Constance.
Let this be the right thing to do.
Leave him alone!
Yeah, get your grubby branches off the old man!
Take that!
And that!
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, kid, come here.
-Take this.
-What?
You have to help me.
Please.
I know you can do it.
Go on.
Go.
Hurry.
How do you know how to drive this thing?
I don't.
The chimney.
The chimney leads to the heart.
Jenny!
Jenny.
Are you all right?
I'm not sure.
DJ, get rid of that thing.
I'm working on it.
Chowder, I need you to get the house down under that crane.
Think you could do that?
Piece of cake.
Come on.
You think you can just mess with my friends?
DJ, look.
Mommy.
Chowder.
Come in, Chowder.
Chowder, buddy?
Hey, guys.
Look who just won.
It's me, the screwup.
Way to go, Chowder, you did it!
Look at me.
Look at Chowder.
Oh, yeah.
-Sorry.
-Guys, come on.
Yes.
Look at me.
You can't do that.
That's not fair.
No.
Get on the top.
Help!
That's it, Chowder.
Keep her coming.
You ain't nothing.
You're a shack.
You're an outhouse.
No!
-l can't.
-Yes, you can.
Go.
I kissed a girl.
I kissed a girl on the lips.
Guys.
Any time now.
Sorry.
DJ, hurry.
I'm flying!
-On three, light the dynamite.
-Okay, I got it.
-One.
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Two.
-Yes.
Thr--
DJ!
Three!
Do you guys hear something?
It's over there.
Come on.
Oh, my dear.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry, Mr. Nebbercracker, about your house and your wife.
Your house-wife.
Forty-five years.
We have been trapped for 45 years.
And now we're free.
We're free.
Thank you, friend.
Thank you all.
We're free.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
-Trick or treat.
-Trick or treat.
Here you go.
-Thanks.
-Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
Next.
What happened to Nebbercracker's house?
It turned into a monster, so I blew it up.
Trick or treat.
We're gonna need a tricycle.
One tricycle, coming up.
Tricycle.
Tricycle.
-Tricycle.
-Hello, tricycle.
I missed you so much.
-Thank you, mister.
-Goodbye, now.
-Happy Halloween.
-Come on.
-Mom.
There's my mom.
-Jenny!
-One second.
-Okay.
So....
We should hang out again.
Soon.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
See you.
Good luck with the puberty.
She grabbed my butt.
That's nice, Chowder.
Hey, Mr. Nebbercracker.
It's time to go.
Oh, you go on.
I've got some work to do.
All right.
Thanks.
-l'll see you around.
-All right.
Bye.
Hey.
Stay off my lawn.
I'm just kidding.
-You think he'll be okay?
-Yeah.
He'll be fine.
He'll go on vacation, get some color, maybe he'll meet someone new.
This time, maybe a nice beach house.
Hey, DJ, look who's here.
-Yes, I can see that, thank you.
-No biggie.
-Hey, boys.
-Hey, Dad.
What the heck kind--?
No, don't tell me.
Let me guess.
It's....
-Dirty pirates?
-That's it.
Dirty pirates.
Fun, fun.
Oh, you look adorable.
Have fun tonight.
You know, you were right.
We're definitely too old for trick-or-treating.
Oh, yeah.
No question about it.
On the other hand we've been working all night.
Candy time?
Candy time.
We're back.
Yes.
Candy.
-Did we just get--?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's Halloween, right?
What do you say you and I go out and "inspect" some candy, huh?
We should go eat some candy too.
That's a good idea.
Okay.
All right.
Let's go eat some candy.
Lots of yummy candy.
Like carrots.
All right, where's the car?
And that is how I slayed that mystical dragon.
Oh, yeah?
That's great.
Come on, baby.
We're out of here.
Not so fast, Bones.
Times have changed.
Skull's not like you.
He gives me the respect I deserve and makes time for me.
Whatever.
Bones!
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Get off my lawn!
Trespasser.
Do you want to be eaten alive?
-No.
-Then get out of here!
My trike.
Stay away from my house!
-DJ!
-We're gonna be late.
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming.
I'm coming.
October 30th, another tricycle.
I'm coming.
Mom.
Mom, he did it again.
He took another tricycle.
Okay, honey, we've talked about this.
You cannot stay up in your room all day staring at an old man through a telescope.
But, Mom, there's something wrong with that house.
I'm serious.
What was that?
I'm serious.
His voice sounds funny.
Someone is hitting puberty.
"What's happening to my body?" Right, buddy?
Maybe you should come with us.
Oh, the boy's too busy.
He's got his spying to do.
I'm not spying.
Well...
"Well..." That's okay, buddy.
When I was your age, I did exactly the same thing.
Of course, it was with binoculars and involved the lovely Jensen twins.
Neither of which was as lovely as your beautiful mother.
Will you be an angel and help me bring out the incisor?
-The incisor.
-Hold this.
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.
Elizabeth will be here in a few hours.
If anything happens, call the police and hide.
He knows that.
See you tomorrow night.
-What have you done?
-Just let me drive this thing, will you?
-Where is DJ?
Where's DJ?
-l'm fine.
You would be so happy if he was under the car, wouldn't you?
Sorry. lt's hard to see with the mask on.
Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder?
Why did you put up your window?
-Chowder.
-lt's aerodynamic.
-Hi, DJ.
-We've got to make time.
The children.
The children.
-What children?
-Bye-bye, baby.
-Tell him you love him, dear.
-He knows that.
-Tell your son you love him.
-l don't wanna tell him.
-He knows I love him.
-He's your son.
-You have to say it.
Roll it down.
-We're gonna be late.
We both love you.
-That includes your dad.
-That's right.
-He's had enough kisses.
-Blow him a kiss.
-Blow him a kiss.
-Goodbye.
Cheer up.
It's almost Halloween.
In one day and three hours, it's candy time.
Okay?
-Check it out, I got a new ball.
-Cool.
Oh, speaking of which, have you decided?
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?
Chowder.
I don't think I'm going trick-or-treating this year.
What?
Come on, you're gonna break a six-year streak.
Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.
Maybe I'm getting too grown-up.
Three seconds on the clock.
I'm playing basketball.
It's time for an in-your-face disgrace.
-Are you okay?
-My nose is in my brains.
Let me see.
Oh, my God.
-What?
-You're a dork.
Where's my ball?
Oh, no.
-Sorry, man.
-Wait, wait.
DJ.
You're a grownup now, you go get it.
Chowder, your ball just landed on Nebbercracker's lawn.
It doesn't exist anymore.
I paid $28 for that ball.
I raked 10 yards and asked my mom for a dollar 26 times.
I never worked that hard in my life--
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.
-So?
-So maybe he's sleeping.
All right, I'll do it.
I'll never forget this.
Hurry, though.
Go.
You.
-No.
-DJ, run!
Get the ball and run!
You're so close.
What have you done?
-Just nudge it over here.
-l'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I didn't mean--
You are dead.
DJ, come on, come on!
-Chowder.
-Come on, DJ.
Help.
Chowder.
Help.
Help.
-You think you can terrorize my lawn?
-No, I'm sorry.
-You wanna be a dead person?
-No. I love life.
This place is not a playground for children.
-Got it from now on.
-This is my house!
Why can't you respect that?
Why can't you just stay away from--?
Push.
No siren.
Never a good sign.
I'm a murderer.
-No, you're not.
-l'm not?
When it's an accident, they call it manslaughter.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Great.
Babysitter's here.
See you, DJ.
Perfect.
DJ.
Hey, DJ, I just saw an ambulance.
Did I miss anything interesting?
Hello?
Elizabeth can I talk to you about something?
Oh, yeah, of course you can, cantaloupe.
We are gonna have the bestest time.
-Got tons of neat activities planned.
-They already left.
-They did?
They're gone?
-Yes, and I need to talk to you.
So the usual deal indoors by 9, in your room by 11.
-Lights out, your call.
-Elizabeth.
-And it's Zee.
-"Zee"?
Now, listen up. I control the TV, the stereo and the phone.
I don't do board games, Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.
I'm not your mother.
I'm not your friend.
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay?
I am practically a grownup.
I don't even need you here, Elizabeth.
-Gosh, DJ, why'd you break that?
-But I didn't.
Yeah, let me ask you something.
Who are they gonna believe?
-Go to your room.
-Fine.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, very funny.
See how you like it.
Happy Halloween, doofus.
Nice one, Bones.
Look at his face.
That's funny.
You're not supposed to have friends over.
Who's this?
-This is Bones.
-What's up?
-He's in a band.
-That's right.
And, anyway, cantaloupe, let's not open up the rulebook, okay?
Since you're up way past your bedtime.
No, no, no, this is different.
Listen.
You called the neighbors.
Good for you.
I used star-69.
He called me.
-Who called you?
-Nebbercracker.
P.S., he died today.
-You lie.
-Do not.
He died, and now I'm getting phone calls from his house.
A phone call from beyond the grave.
Guys, come on. I'm serious.
Oh, he's serious.
Did you know he was serious?
-Come on, man, give her back.
-Oh, "her"?
You mind?
Oh, come on.
Gross.
-Come on, Bones.
-Wait, hold on, dude. I th--
She's having trouble breathing.
Might have something in her throat.
All right, I'll look into it.
-No.
Elizabeth.
No.
-Okay, Bones, knock it off.
Downstairs, now.
Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.
You are so funny.
I know. lt's like I don't even try and it just happens.
God, stop doing this.
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do?
-Homicide.
-Chowder, where are your parents?
My dad's at the pharmacy and my mom's at the movies with her personal trainer.
-Meet me at the Danger Zone now.
-Fine.
-Bones, I said, knock it off.
-Come on, man.
No, I'm creeped out.
You know, I saw an ambulance here today.
So?
So maybe Nebbercracker really did die.
We should be so lucky.
The guy is evil.
No, he's just a crotchety old dude.
Oh, really, Zee?
When I was 10 years old, I had a kite.
Awesome kite.
I could fly it so high you couldn't see it.
One day, it crashed down.
I followed the string and it ended right over there across the street, right at the edge of his lawn.
Did he take your kite?
Yeah, he takes whatever lands on his lawn.
But that's not the point.
The point is, is that I saw him talking to his house and kissing it.
Besides everybody knows what he did to his wife.
Why?
What--?
What did he do to her?
-He ate her.
-Bones.
Get off.
Stop it!
-Bones, enough.
-Come on, Zee.
Bones, I'm so sick of you.
-l was just--
-You have no respect for women.
What?
What does that mean?
Get out.
Fine.
Prude.
What are you looking at?
Nebbercracker.
You really are dead, aren't you?
I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.
What are you gonna do about it, Nebbercracker?
Nebber-snapper-flipper-dipper--
My awesome kite.
Chowder.
Chowder.
Chowder?
Chowder.
Heat seeker.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Shut up.
What?
Nebbercracker's back from the dead.
-No way.
-Yeah.
They leave the keys in here.
You dare me?
Chowder, you're not listening to me.
Nebbercracker's haunting me, all right?
His blood is on my hands.
And now he's coming back for revenge.
You're really crazy right now.
Have you noticed that?
I think you're just freaking out because you killed a guy today.
Life goes on.
For you.
Try and relax.
Be cool, like me.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Make it stop.
Quit screwing around.
I need your help.
Fine.
You want my help?
-Yeah.
-l got three words for you.
"Trick or treat."
Okay.
Whatever.
Let's go.
Hold on.
Chowder, come on.
The haunting is subtle yet really, really boring.
-Can I go home now?
-Chowder, he'll hear you.
DJ this is why nobody will sit next to us at lunch.
I'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house and you'll see.
No ghost.
Chowder, stop, please.
Chowder, I'm serious.
Chowder, come back.
Come back here, please, Chowder.
Come on.
Chowder.
Come back.
-Oh, no.
A bottle.
-Chowder, put that down.
-Come back, please.
-Bottle.
Hey, DJ, who am I?
Get off my lawn.
Don't.
Come on.
Run.
Chowder, get out of there.
-Chowder, come here.
-Mommy.
This way.
This way.
Help.
Come on, Chowder!
Chowder, this way!
Don't look back.
I looked back.
Bones?
Coming.
Don't even think about crawling back here...
Trick or treat.
What?
Good morning, ma'am.
You witnessed a simulation of what you'll face this evening.
Studies show that households that run out of candy are 55 percent more likely to be TP'd.
To help avert this tragedy I'm here selling Halloween candy for my school, Westbrook Prep.
Good school.
I got kicked out of there.
Now, what do you want?
Just trying to get a head start on life and secure a successful future.
You want a successful future?
When a guy with tattoos comes up to the drive-through give him his burger, not your phone number.
Thank you for the advice.
I'll be sure to make a note of it.
But back to business.
Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.
Without candy, I'm afraid your house is a bull's-eye with shingles.
Nice try. lt's not my house.
Babysitter?
Okay, let's cut the crap.
Maybe the parents you work for left you $40 in emergency money.
Maybe they left me 30.
Maybe you give me 20, I write a receipt for 30 and you pocket 10.
Maybe.
And I want two extra bags of peanut clusters.
One bag and I'll toss in a licorice whip.
You're good.
Eight a.m. No detectable movement.
No detectable movement.
Hey, DJ, I brought you some chocolate.
Cover blown?
No detectable movement.
What are you two weirdoes up to?
Oh, nothing.
Just something in the house across the street just tried to eat us.
Yeah.
We've been watching all night.
We haven't even left this room once.
Not even to go to the bathroom.
Don't drink that.
Oh, gross.
Whatever disease you guys have I'm sure it's got letters and that they make pills for it.
Zee, it's true.
There's something evil going on across the street.
That's excellent.
I'm really happy for you.
Anyway, have you two astronomers seen Bones?
He left last night unexpectedly and he never came back.
Never came back?
-Bottle.
-Of course.
Oh, okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.
Listen, Zee, I don't know how to tell you this--
Your boyfriend has most likely been eaten alive.
Sherry Klausen.
I gotta go.
Breakfast.
Happy Halloween, losers.
Hello.
What?
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
Let me see.
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.
-No.
No.
Hey.
-Hey, wait.
Hey.
DJ, that's your phone.
-No, stop.
-Girl.
Hey.
-Don't go in there.
-Hold it.
Don't go any further.
-Come here.
-Yes, over here.
Are you guys mentally challenged?
If you are, I'm certified to teach you baseball.
Detectable movement.
-What do we do?
What do we do?
-Come on.
Guys.
-Run, Chowder.
-l'm running.
Help, please.
-Got her.
-No, I got her.
Hello?
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.
There's an angry dad on the phone looking for the one called Chowder.
Hello?
Losers, I'm talking to you.
He's worried about you.
He should be.
-Start explaining.
-All right, the house, it tried to eat us.
-Stop explaining, I've had enough.
-Wait, wait, where are you going?
To see what's happening with that stupid house of yours.
-No, no, no.
You can't.
-What is your problem?
Puberty.
Yeah, I'm having lots and lots of puberty.
-No more Mountain Dew.
-Right.
I'm going to find Bones.
All right, you have fun.
Don't worry about us, we'll be fine.
And you tell him I said hey, okay?
Safe driving.
See you!
Oh, hi.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Oh, yeah. I made the whole puberty thing up.
Hi, I'm JD.
DJ.
Yes, Dad, I meant to call you, but I forgot.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay.
Absolutely.
Affirmative.
-Okay, love you.
Bye.
-Yeah.
And this is our little observation post such as it were.
Yeah, posters are stupid.
I was gonna tear them down and put up some art.
Well, Dad, why don't you kiss my hairy butt?
Hey, DJ, you got any beer?
Well, hello there.
This is Chowder.
Charles, to the ladies.
Jenny Bennett.
Two-term class president at Westbrook Prep.
-That's a tough school to get into.
-Yeah, I got in, but decided not to go.
It's a girls' school.
Which is why I didn't.
You know, there's a...
There's a great taco stand near there.
I hate Mexican food.
-Me too.
-Me too.
Fascinating, isn't it?
Just sits there waiting mocking us with its houseness.
-May I please use your phone?
-Yeah, sure.
Here.
Who you calling?
-My mother.
-Rude.
She's probably not gonna believe you.
It's too much for the adult mind to comprehend.
is this pee?
Because if it is, that's really gross.
-lt's--
-DJ?
You pee in bottles?
What are you talking about?
That one's your pee.
-lt's yours.
-lt's his.
-May I speak with Allison?
-Unsanitary.
-Her daughter.
Thank you.
-lt's his pee.
Excuse me.
I was selling chocolates in Mayville, and, well, it's kind of confusing.
So you hate Mexican food, huh?
Yeah.
You too, huh?
Yeah, in fact, you might say I started hating it first.
Outside in front of the house?
-Fine.
Let's get technical.
-Okay.
I started hating it through the telescope.
Can't call dibs on a girl through a telescope.
You can't call dibs on a girl.
-Just did.
-Me too.
She didn't believe me.
Authority can be so.
Okay.
Normally I don't spend time with guys like you.
But a house just tried to eat me, so you've got one hour.
Oh, a puppy.
Didn't see that coming.
Okay I think it's time to call the police.
Do you realize what's gonna happen tonight?
Hundreds of kids walking right up to that house.
Wait, wait, wait.
Come on.
Guys, I think we're overreacting.
Think about it.
Only a total moron would walk up to old man Nebbercracker's house.
-Hey, my ball.
-Chowder.
No.
It's gonna be a bloodbath.
Good news.
The cops are here.
All right, kids, this better be good.
I was in the forest wrestling with a bear claw when we got the call.
I was eating a doughnut.
All three of you, step to the car now.
-My ears.
-They're at the car.
He's a rookie.
First week on the job.
Officer, we have reason to believe there's a dangerous creature inside that house.
-lt may have killed a man.
-And a dog.
Doggy down?
We've got a situation.
-We've got a situation.
-What are you doing?
Calling for backup.
Didn't you hear the kid?
There's a dangerous creature inside that house.
We don't have backup.
It's just Judy at the station.
And this is no situation.
It's just a couple Tater Tots hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.
I bet you the dead dog would beg to differ.
What was that?
Nothing.
All right.
Time's up, peewees.
-lt's Halloween.
We got things to do.
-We do?
No, wait, you can't.
All right, this thing, it has a mouth and it comes out and grabs things and pulls them in and eats them.
Yeah, like this.
Okay, okay, okay.
The thing is we're trying to make this sound more real than it normally would.
Problem is it sounds kind of not real.
-So we'll see you later.
-No.
All right. I'll show you.
But if things get out of hand...
We'll aim for Bigfoot.
That's loaded.
He's hopping.
Smart house.
Hey.
You-
- Both of you.
Come here.
Bring it to the car.
Come on.
I'm gonna forget you throwing that rock because that dance was pretty funny.
But next time any of you mess with this guy's house all three of you are going in the hole, you got it?
Now, I'll give you 10 seconds to march.
But we need your help.
It's your job to help us.
-One.
-Come on.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
That's tender.
My house is right over there.
So much for relying on the government.
Yeah, I know.
I hate the government.
-Dude, we're screwed.
-No, we're not.
We'll go to an expert.
You're looking at the three-time, tri-state over-14 "Thou Art Dead" champion.
His name is Reginald Skulinski.
But they call him Skull.
-Who's "they"?
-Me and DJ.
-Yeah.
-He's the smartest guy on earth.
So let's go talk to him.
-Hey, Jenny, Jenny.
-Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on.
Hold up.
Skull is in the game zone right now.
You don't wanna mess with him when he's in the game zone.
Fine, so how long is he gonna be playing?
Die.
Die.
Who knows?
He once played for four days straight on one quarter, a gallon of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.
The man's a legend.
Well, if he's not coming out of the game zone, then we are going in.
-What?
Hey, what are you--?
-What?
Jenny, no.
It's like you're not gonna-- You're not gonna do it.
Like--
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die.
Watch out.
Did you see that?
I just chopped off your head again.
Your head's rolling.
You can't see it, your eyes are on your head.
-Sir?
-What?
I'm busy playing a video game without even looking at the screen.
What?
Old man Nebbercracker's house is possessed.
I need to know how to destroy it before it kills people.
Calm down.
You make me wanna throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.
Oh, you like the steel of my blade?
It's so cold.
Possessed house, you say?
In my travels to the video store and comic-book conventions I've seen many strange and wondrous things.
And I've heard tell of man-made structures becoming possessed by a human soul so that the spirit becomes merged with wood and brick creating a rare form of monster known as Domus mactabilis.
The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.
We're its murderous enemies.
Have fun getting killed.
Run, coward.
Look at that blood.
So how do we kill it?
You've gotta strike at the source of life, the heart.
But houses don't have hearts.
Yes!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You might be right about that.
Sorry, children, but I've got some very important business to take care of.
I won't be seeing you later.
Thou art dead.
So we need to strike at the heart.
Yeah, but where are we gonna find a heart inside a house?
Ever since Nebbercracker died there's been smoke coming out of that chimney.
The furnace.
The furnace is the heart.
If we wanna put out the fire, we're gonna have to go inside.
Without getting chewed to pieces.
-Dummy.
-Hey, I was just doodling.
No, Chowder, this is it.
First, we build a dummy.
We fill the dummy with a few gallons of cold medicine.
-Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy.
-Say what?
Feed the dummy to the house, house eats the medicine, goes to sleep.
-Look at this.
-We get in, douse the fire and get out.
-Questions?
-Yes, are you nuts?
I don't wanna steal drugs from my father I don't wanna go inside a monster and I don't wanna die.
-l say it's worth a shot.
-Yes, I agree, let's do it.
Hey, but I wanted that one.
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-Yes.
-Chowder.
Quiet.
-Sorry.
Go.
Whoopsie-daisy.
All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy, I'm gonna move you into position.
You don't be scared.
That's not how I trained you.
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.
Chowder, come on.
Okay.
Yes.
Trick or treat.
Plug it in.
So close.
Littering, loitering, vandalism, vagrancy--
-And treason.
-No, not treason.
-You sure?
Because in the book-- -l'm sure.
All right, kids, out of the trash cans.
Let's go.
Come on.
You heard the big guy.
You see the light.
Walk towards it.
Come on, keep it moving.
All right, drop your weapons.
Pass them to me.
Come on.
-l will shoot you.
-Well, lookie we got here.
You stay here, I'm checking this out.
I am on it.
Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me?
Huh, tough girl?
You disrespecting the badge?
You don't want none of this.
I'm telling you.
Test me.
Please.
Y'all wanna test me?
I am the police.
I know you're a thug.
Them brown eyes... I see it in your eyes.
That's it.
That is it.
You got something to say, Porky, huh?
-That's it, we're taking them in.
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Where we taking them?
-To jail.
Let's go.
You hear that?
You guys are going to jail.
But, officer, you've gotta believe us.
Yeah, 2-percent, you got the right to shut up.
-Okay, the house is a monster.
-And to think I believed you.
Hey, listen, I'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.
I mean, kind of a cop.
He has a gun.
Yeah.
They're gonna love you downtown, Jughead.
We are supercops.
Yeah.
That's why I live in a condo.
Supercop.
Super-duper-duper-cop.
Super--
-You hear that?
-That's my stomach. I'm starving.
No, no.
That sounds like the dangerous creature.
-l'm gonna go check it out.
-Oh, my gosh.
This is like trying to wrangle a puppy.
All right, I'll be back.
-You guys, stop.
-Hey, guys.
-No.
Get out of there.
-No, don't go in there.
What?
I tell you.
Super-roll.
-Stop.
Stop.
-Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
You don't know what's up with that house.
Where you at, spooky creature?
I'm gonna find you.
Freeze tree.
Hey, what you doing?
You can't do that.
Not to an officer, brother.
That is illegal.
-l'm coming, buddy.
-Put me down!
-l'm gonna go get backup.
-l thought there was no backup.
I'm getting Judy.
Judy!
Help!
Mama!
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
-l think I'm having a stroke.
-Just try to stay calm, okay?
We'll be all right if we just stay calm.
I'm too young to die!
Jenny. I've always loved you.
-Chowder!
-Sorry.
Mama!
I can't look.
Guys, come on.
Let's go.
We're dead.
You've killed us and now we're dead.
I don't think the house knows that we're in here.
I bet it thinks we're still in the car.
Listen.
It sounds like it's sleeping.
The only way that we're gonna get out of here alive is if we find the heart, we put out the fire.
Maybe we should examine our other options.
Sure.
Other option.
We wait here and do nothing until it wakes up and eats us.
Find the heart, put out the fire.
Got it.
Explosives.
That's so cool.
-He was watching me.
-DJ.
Did you ever see a wife?
People used to say he had one but he fattened her up and he ate her.
"Demolition squad."
Sorry.
Come on.
Be quiet.
Don't worry, I have a very light step.
There.
Right there.
Shoot it.
What?
I thought if I shot the heart, that--
-That's not the heart.
-Then what is it?
Well, if those are the teeth and that's the tongue then that must be the uvula.
So it's a girl house.
What?
No.
It stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.
Not me.
No.
Okay.
Let's move.
We need to move quickly and quietly.
Don't touch anything.
And stay together--
-DJ!
-Wait.
DJ.
I'll save you.
Chowder, knock it off.
Sorry. I thought you were-
- DJ!
-Chowder, it's a toy.
-Oh, yeah.
Where's DJ?
-DJ.
-Over here.
Look at all these toys.
This must be where Nebbercracker kept his stash.
"Stash."
I think you guys should have a look at this.
-The key.
-Come on, we don't have time for this.
Yeah, we've gotta find a way out of here.
What are you doing?
We have a Ping-Pong table in our basement.
Constance.
Holy moly.
He really did eat her.
Couldn't have.
Her whole body is buried in cement.
Look at all this stuff.
Why would he build her a shrine if he murdered her?
Maybe he just felt guilty or something.
DJ, can we please get out of here?
I always knew you were hiding something, Mr. Nebbercracker.
DJ.
Way to go, big nose.
-lt's awake.
-Run!
Hide.
Hey, I know that sound.
My ball.
Where are you going?
Come here.
-Chowder, come back.
-You get back here.
Gotcha.
Killer Slinkys!
-Chowder.
-Leave me alone!
DJ!
Help!
Oh, no.
Get off.
Jenny.
Chowder.
Come on, Chowder, grab on.
Gotcha.
DJ, look out!
No!
The uvula.
-DJ--
-Chowder.
Mommy!
Gross.
Did we just get upchucked?
The uvula, nature's emergency exit.
That's it.
Another great idea, DJ.
Brilliant.
What do you want from me, Chowder?
I don't see you coming up with any big ideas.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Do you wanna hear my big idea?
I'm going home to make a pretzel sandwich.
See you.
Chowder, the house is still alive and you're gonna wuss out?
I risked my life for you.
I stole drugs for you and I could've died in there.
-Yeah, me too.
You're the one that killed Nebbercracker in the first place.
-Getting your ball back.
-You guys.
Stop fighting.
You're acting like babies.
We are babies.
What were we thinking?
We tried to put a house to sleep with cold medicine.
-How lame can you get?
-Where are you going?
I'm going home. I suck.
DJ.
At least it's an ambulance.
DJ?
It's a ghost.
Begone.
Fie.
Begone yourself.
Get away.
He's not a ghost.
He's not dead. I'm not a murderer.
Of course I'm not dead.
Who said I was dead?
You'll be dead if you don't scram.
-Come on, DJ.
-Let's hurry.
Don't you know what day this is?
I'm running out of time.
I'm running out of time.
Honey I'm home.
Oh, look at you, dear.
Your shingles are all ruffled and your windows are cracked.
Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart.
It's no problem at all.
It's her.
The house is her.
-DJ, what are you doing?
-Wait.
Come on.
-Come back.
-Where you going?
Nothing paint and varnish can't handle.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know about Constance.
You what?
What do you know?
You don't know anything.
You were in my house?
You--
You didn't kill her, did you?
I love her so much.
Hello?
It's okay.
I can take you away from here.
Would you like that?
Yes.
There we go.
Won't be long now.
All right.
Okay, open your eyes.
-Now, it's not much, I know, but just--
-Darling.
Get away from my house!
I'm gonna rip them to bits.
Help.
-Constance.
-Help.
Help.
-What's wrong?
Are you hurt?
-Hurt?
Yes, I'm hurt.
Those criminals are attacking our house.
-Trick or treat.
-Now, now they're just kids, dear.
-lt's Halloween.
-No, no, no.
It's my house, and they're hurting me.
Constance, look at me.
Look at me.
As long as I'm here, I will never let anyone hurt you.
-Constance.
-Sucker.
You vandals.
-Eat this.
-You hooligans.
-l'll get you.
-Constance, no!
So I finished the house.
She would've wanted that.
She died, but she didn't leave.
And that night that one night of every year I had to take precautions.
-Trick or treat.
-l had to.
-Sucker.
-l had to.
Hey!
Get a--
Stay away from my house!
She attacks anyone who comes near.
Go.
I'm coming, dear.
Go.
No, no, no, wait. I can't let you do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know that you've been protecting us all these years.
But now it's our turn to protect you.
Let her go.
But if I let her go then I'll have no one.
That's not true.
Constance, no!
Come on.
The house is alive!
This way.
This way.
Come on.
You guys, come on.
-What are you doing?
-Trying to slow the house down.
Move it, pork chop.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Mr. Nebbercracker.
Come on.
I can't.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Hurry.
Go on. I'll be all right.
Oh, man.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
You stay away from those children, Constance!
Constance.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, now...
There, there, girl.
My sweet.
You've been a bad girl, haven't you?
You've hurt people.
Oh, Constance.
Oh, we've always known this day would come.
Haven't we?
I have to make things right.
I have to make things right.
Constance.
I've always done what's best for you, haven't I?
Haven't I, girl?
Come on, let's move.
Oh, Constance.
Let this be the right thing to do.
Leave him alone!
Yeah, get your grubby branches off the old man!
Take that!
And that!
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, kid, come here.
-Take this.
-What?
You have to help me.
Please.
I know you can do it.
Go on.
Go.
Hurry.
How do you know how to drive this thing?
I don't.
The chimney.
The chimney leads to the heart.
Jenny!
Jenny.
Are you all right?
I'm not sure.
DJ, get rid of that thing.
I'm working on it.
Chowder, I need you to get the house down under that crane.
Think you could do that?
Piece of cake.
Come on.
You think you can just mess with my friends?
DJ, look.
Mommy.
Chowder.
Come in, Chowder.
Chowder, buddy?
Hey, guys.
Look who just won.
It's me, the screwup.
Way to go, Chowder, you did it!
Look at me.
Look at Chowder.
Oh, yeah.
-Sorry.
-Guys, come on.
Yes.
Look at me.
You can't do that.
That's not fair.
No.
Get on the top.
Help!
That's it, Chowder.
Keep her coming.
You ain't nothing.
You're a shack.
You're an outhouse.
No!
-l can't.
-Yes, you can.
Go.
I kissed a girl.
I kissed a girl on the lips.
Guys.
Any time now.
Sorry.
DJ, hurry.
I'm flying!
-On three, light the dynamite.
-Okay, I got it.
-One.
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Two.
-Yes.
Thr--
DJ!
Three!
Do you guys hear something?
It's over there.
Come on.
Oh, my dear.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry, Mr. Nebbercracker, about your house and your wife.
Your house-wife.
Forty-five years.
We have been trapped for 45 years.
And now we're free.
We're free.
Thank you, friend.
Thank you all.
We're free.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
-Trick or treat.
-Trick or treat.
Here you go.
-Thanks.
-Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
Next.
What happened to Nebbercracker's house?
It turned into a monster, so I blew it up.
Trick or treat.
We're gonna need a tricycle.
One tricycle, coming up.
Tricycle.
Tricycle.
-Tricycle.
-Hello, tricycle.
I missed you so much.
-Thank you, mister.
-Goodbye, now.
-Happy Halloween.
-Come on.
-Mom.
There's my mom.
-Jenny!
-One second.
-Okay.
So...
We should hang out again.
Soon.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
See you.
Good luck with the puberty.
She grabbed my butt.
That's nice, Chowder.
Hey, Mr. Nebbercracker.
It's time to go.
Oh, you go on.
I've got some work to do.
All right.
Thanks.
-l'll see you around.
-All right.
Bye.
Hey.
Stay off my lawn.
I'm just kidding.
-You think he'll be okay?
-Yeah.
He'll be fine.
He'll go on vacation, get some color, maybe he'll meet someone new.
This time, maybe a nice beach house.
Hey, DJ, look who's here.
-Yes, I can see that, thank you.
-No biggie.
-Hey, boys.
-Hey, Dad.
What the heck kind--?
No, don't tell me.
Let me guess.
It's...
-Dirty pirates?
-That's it.
Dirty pirates.
Fun, fun.
Oh, you look adorable.
Have fun tonight.
You know, you were right.
We're definitely too old for trick-or-treating.
Oh, yeah.
No question about it.
On the other hand we've been working all night.
Candy time?
Candy time.
We're back.
Yes.
Candy.
-Did we just get--?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's Halloween, right?
What do you say you and I go out and "inspect" some candy, huh?
We should go eat some candy too.
That's a good idea.
Okay.
All right.
Let's go eat some candy.
Lots of yummy candy.
Like carrots.
All right, where's the car?
And that is how I slayed that mystical dragon.
Oh, yeah?
That's great.
Come on, baby.
We're out of here.
Not so fast, Bones.
Times have changed.
Skull's not like you.
He gives me the respect I deserve and makes time for me.
Whatever.
Bones!
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Get off my lawn!
Trespasser.
Do you want to be eaten alive?
- No.
- Then get out of here!
My trike.
Stay away from my house!
- DJ!
- We're gonna be late.
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming.
I'm coming.
October 30th: another tricycle.
I'm coming.
Mom.
Mom, he did it again.
He took another tricycle.
Okay, honey, we've talked about this.
You cannot stay up in your room all day staring at an old man through a telescope.
But, Mom, there's something wrong with that house.
I'm serious.
What was that?
I'm serious.
His voice sounds funny.
Someone is hitting puberty.
"What's happening to my body?" Right, buddy?
Maybe you should come with us.
Oh, the boy's too busy.
He's got his spying to do.
I'm not spying.
Well...
"Well..." That's okay, buddy.
When I was your age, I did exactly the same thing.
Of course, it was with binoculars and involved the lovely Jensen twins.
Neither of which was as lovely as your beautiful mother.
Will you be an angel and help me bring out the incisor?
- The incisor.
- Hold this.
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.
Elizabeth will be here in a few hours.
If anything happens, call the police and hide.
He knows that.
See you tomorrow night.
- What have you done?
- Just let me drive this thing, will you?
- Where is DJ?
Where's DJ?
- I'm fine.
You would be so happy if he was under the car, wouldn't you?
Sorry.
It's hard to see with the mask on.
Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder?
Why did you put up your window?
- Chowder.
- It's aerodynamic.
- Hi, DJ.
- We've got to make time.
The children.
The children.
- What children?
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Tell him you love him, dear.
- He knows that.
- Tell your son you love him.
- I don't wanna tell him.
- He knows I love him.
- He's your son.
- You have to say it.
Roll it down.
- We're gonna be late.
We both love you.
- That includes your dad.
- That's right.
- He's had enough kisses.
- Blow him a kiss.
- Blow him a kiss.
- Goodbye.
Cheer up.
It's almost Halloween.
In one day and three hours, it's candy time.
Okay?
- Check it out, I got a new ball.
- Cool.
Oh, speaking of which, have you decided?
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?
Chowder.
I don't think I'm going trick-or-treating this year.
What?
Come on, you're gonna break a six-year streak.
Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.
Maybe I'm getting too grown-up.
Three seconds on the clock.
I'm playing basketball.
It's time for an in-your-face disgrace.
- Are you okay?
- My nose is in my brains.
Let me see.
Oh, my God.
- What?
- You're a dork.
Where's my ball?
Oh, no.
- Sorry, man.
- Wait, wait.
DJ.
You're a grownup now, you go get it.
Chowder, your ball just landed on Nebbercracker's lawn.
It doesn't exist anymore.
I paid $28 for that ball.
I raked 10 yards and asked my mom for a dollar 26 times.
I never worked that hard in my life-
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.
- So?
- So maybe he's sleeping.
All right, I'll do it.
I'll never forget this.
Hurry, though.
Go.
You.
- No.
- DJ, run!
Get the ball and run!
You're so close.
What have you done?
- Just nudge it over here.
- I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I didn't mean-
You are dead.
DJ, come on, come on!
- Chowder.
- Come on, DJ.
Help.
Chowder.
Help.
Help.
- You think you can terrorize my lawn?
- No, I'm sorry.
- You wanna be a dead person?
- No.
I love life.
This place is not a playground for children.
- Got it from now on.
- This is my house!
Why can't you respect that?
Why can't you just stay away from-?
Push.
No siren.
Never a good sign.
I'm a murderer.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?
When it's an accident, they call it manslaughter.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Great.
Babysitter's here.
See you, DJ.
Perfect.
DJ.
Hey, DJ, I just saw an ambulance.
Did I miss anything interesting?
Hello?
Elizabeth can I talk to you about something?
Oh, yeah, of course you can, cantaloupe.
We are gonna have the bestest time.
- Got tons of neat activities planned.
- They already left.
- They did?
They're gone?
- Yes, and I need to talk to you.
So the usual deal: indoors by 9, in your room by 11.
- Lights out, your call.
- Elizabeth.
- And it's Zee.
- "Zee"?
Now, listen up.
I control the TV, the stereo and the phone.
I don't do board games, Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.
I'm not your mother.
I'm not your friend.
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay?
I am practically a grownup.
I don't even need you here, Elizabeth.
- Gosh, DJ, why'd you break that?
- But I didn't.
Yeah, let me ask you something.
Who are they gonna believe?
- Go to your room.
- Fine.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, very funny.
See how you like it.
Happy Halloween, doofus.
Nice one, Bones.
Look at his face.
That's funny.
You're not supposed to have friends over.
Who's this?
- This is Bones.
- What's up?
- He's in a band.
- That's right.
And, anyway, cantaloupe, let's not open up the rulebook, okay?
Since you're up way past your bedtime.
No, no, no, this is different.
Listen.
You called the neighbors.
Good for you.
I used star-69.
He called me.
- Who called you?
- Nebbercracker.
P.S., he died today.
- You lie.
- Do not.
He died, and now I'm getting phone calls from his house.
A phone call from beyond the grave.
Guys, come on.
I'm serious.
Oh, he's serious.
Did you know he was serious?
- Come on, man, give her back.
- Oh, "her"?
You mind?
Oh, come on.
Gross.
- Come on, Bones.
- Wait, hold on, dude.
I th-
She's having trouble breathing.
Might have something in her throat.
All right, I'll look into it.
- No.
Elizabeth.
No.
- Okay, Bones, knock it off.
Downstairs, now.
Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.
You are so funny.
I know.
It's like I don't even try and it just happens.
God, stop doing this.
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do?
- Homicide.
- Chowder, where are your parents?
My dad's at the pharmacy and my mom's at the movies with her personal trainer.
- Meet me at the Danger Zone now.
- Fine.
- Bones, I said, knock it off.
- Come on, man.
No, I'm creeped out.
You know, I saw an ambulance here today.
So?
So maybe Nebbercracker really did die.
We should be so lucky.
The guy is evil.
No, he's just a crotchety old dude.
Oh, really, Zee?
When I was 10 years old, I had a kite.
Awesome kite.
I could fly it so high you couldn't see it.
One day, it crashed down.
I followed the string and it ended right over there across the street, right at the edge of his lawn.
Did he take your kite?
Yeah, he takes whatever lands on his lawn.
But that's not the point.
The point is, is that I saw him talking to his house and kissing it.
Besides everybody knows what he did to his wife.
Why?
What-?
What did he do to her?
- He ate her.
- Bones.
Get off.
Stop it!
- Bones, enough.
- Come on, Zee.
Bones, I'm so sick of you.
- I was just-
- You have no respect for women.
What?
What does that mean?
Get out.
Fine.
Prude.
What are you looking at?
Nebbercracker.
You really are dead, aren't you?
I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.
What are you gonna do about it, Nebbercracker?
Nebber-snapper-flipper-dipper-
My awesome kite.
Chowder.
Chowder.
Chowder?
Chowder.
Heat seeker.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Shut up.
What?
Nebbercracker's back from the dead.
- No way.
- Yeah.
They leave the keys in here.
You dare me?
Chowder, you're not listening to me.
Nebbercracker's haunting me, all right?
His blood is on my hands.
And now he's coming back for revenge.
You're really crazy right now.
Have you noticed that?
I think you're just freaking out because you killed a guy today.
Life goes on.
For you.
Try and relax.
Be cool, like me.
Chowder, what are you doing?
Make it stop.
Quit screwing around.
I need your help.
Fine.
You want my help?
- Yeah.
- I got three words for you:
"Trick or treat."
Okay.
Whatever.
Let's go.
Hold on.
Chowder, come on.
The haunting is subtle yet really, really boring.
- Can I go home now?
- Chowder, he'll hear you.
DJ this is why nobody will sit next to us at lunch.
I'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house and you'll see.
No ghost.
Chowder, stop, please.
Chowder, I'm serious.
Chowder, come back.
Come back here, please, Chowder.
Come on.
Chowder.
Come back.
- Oh, no.
A bottle.
- Chowder, put that down.
- Come back, please.
- Bottle.
Hey, DJ, who am I?
Get off my lawn.
Don't.
Come on.
Run.
Chowder, get out of there.
- Chowder, come here.
- Mommy.
This way.
This way.
Help.
Come on, Chowder!
Chowder, this way!
Don't look back.
I looked back.
Bones?
Coming.
Don't even think about crawling back here...
Trick or treat.
What?
Good morning, ma'am.
You witnessed a simulation of what you'll face this evening.
Studies show that households that run out of candy are 55 percent more likely to be TP'd.
To help avert this tragedy I'm here selling Halloween candy for my school, Westbrook Prep.
Good school.
I got kicked out of there.
Now, what do you want?
Just trying to get a head start on life and secure a successful future.
You want a successful future?
When a guy with tattoos comes up to the drive-through give him his burger, not your phone number.
Thank you for the advice.
I'll be sure to make a note of it.
But back to business.
Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.
Without candy, I'm afraid your house is a bull's-eye with shingles.
Nice try.
It's not my house.
Babysitter?
Okay, let's cut the crap.
Maybe the parents you work for left you $40 in emergency money.
Maybe they left me 30.
Maybe you give me 20, I write a receipt for 30 and you pocket 10.
Maybe.
And I want two extra bags of peanut clusters.
One bag and I'll toss in a licorice whip.
You're good.
Eight A.M. No detectable movement.
No detectable movement.
Hey, DJ, I brought you some chocolate.
Cover blown?
No detectable movement.
What are you two weirdoes up to?
Oh, nothing.
Just something in the house across the street just tried to eat us.
Yeah.
We've been watching all night.
We haven't even left this room once.
Not even to go to the bathroom.
Don't drink that.
Oh, gross.
Whatever disease you guys have I'm sure it's got letters and that they make pills for it.
Zee, it's true.
There's something evil going on across the street.
That's excellent.
I'm really happy for you.
Anyway, have you two astronomers seen Bones?
He left last night unexpectedly and he never came back.
Never came back?
- Bottle.
- Of course.
Oh, okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.
Listen, Zee, I don't know how to tell you this-
Your boyfriend has most likely been eaten alive.
Sherry Klausen.
I gotta go.
Breakfast.
Happy Halloween, losers.
Hello.
What?
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
Let me see.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- No.
No.
Hey.
- Hey, wait.
Hey.
DJ, that's your phone.
- No, stop.
- Girl.
Hey.
- Don't go in there.
- Hold it.
Don't go any further.
- Come here.
- Yes, over here.
Are you guys mentally challenged?
If you are, I'm certified to teach you baseball.
Detectable movement.
- What do we do?
What do we do?
- Come on.
Guys.
- Run, Chowder.
- I'm running.
Help, please.
- Got her.
- No, I got her.
Hello?
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.
There's an angry dad on the phone looking for the one called Chowder.
Hello?
Losers, I'm talking to you.
He's worried about you.
He should be.
- Start explaining.
- All right, the house, it tried to eat us.
- Stop explaining, I've had enough.
- Wait, wait, where are you going?
To see what's happening with that stupid house of yours.
- No, no, no.
You can't.
- What is your problem?
Puberty.
Yeah, I'm having lots and lots of puberty.
- No more Mountain Dew.
- Right.
I'm going to find Bones.
All right, you have fun.
Don't worry about us, we'll be fine.
And you tell him I said hey, okay?
Safe driving.
See you.
Oh, hi.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Oh, yeah.
I made the whole puberty thing up.
Hi, I'm JD.
DJ.
Yes, Dad, I meant to call you, but I forgot.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay.
Absolutely.
Affirmative.
- Okay, love you.
Bye.
- Yeah.
And this is our little observation post such as it were.
Yeah, posters are stupid.
I was gonna tear them down and put up some art.
Well, Dad, why don't you kiss my hairy butt?
Hey, DJ, you got any beer?
Well, hello there.
This is Chowder.
Charles, to the ladies.
Jenny Bennett.
Two-term class president at Westbrook Prep.
- That's a tough school to get into.
- Yeah, I got in, but decided not to go.
It's a girls' school.
Which is why I didn't.
You know, there's a...
There's a great taco stand near there.
I hate Mexican food.
- Me too.
- Me too.
Fascinating, isn't it?
Just sits there waiting mocking us with its houseness.
- May I please use your phone?
- Yeah, sure.
Here.
Who you calling?
- My mother.
- Rude.
She's probably not gonna believe you.
It's too much for the adult mind to comprehend.
Is this pee?
Because if it is, that's really gross.
- It's-
- DJ?
You pee in bottles?
What are you talking about?
That one's your pee.
- It's yours.
- It's his.
- May I speak with Allison?
- Unsanitary.
- Her daughter.
Thank you.
- It's his pee.
Excuse me.
I was selling chocolates in Mayville, and, well, it's kind of confusing.
So you hate Mexican food, huh?
Yeah.
You too, huh?
Yeah, in fact, you might say I started hating it first.
Outside in front of the house?
- Fine.
Let's get technical.
- Okay.
I started hating it through the telescope.
Can't call dibs on a girl through a telescope.
You can't call dibs on a girl.
- Just did.
- Me too.
She didn't believe me.
Authority can be so:
Okay.
Normally I don't spend time with guys like you.
But a house just tried to eat me, so you've got one hour.
Oh, a puppy.
Didn't see that coming.
Okay I think it's time to call the police.
Do you realize what's gonna happen tonight?
Hundreds of kids walking right up to that house.
Wait, wait, wait.
Come on.
Guys, I think we're overreacting.
Think about it.
Only a total moron would walk up to old man Nebbercracker's house.
- Hey, my ball.
- Chowder.
No.
It's gonna be a bloodbath.
Good news.
The cops are here.
All right, kids, this better be good.
I was in the forest wrestling with a bear claw when we got the call.
I was eating a doughnut.
All three of you, step to the car now.
- My ears.
- They're at the car.
He's a rookie.
First week on the job.
Officer, we have reason to believe there's a dangerous creature inside that house.
- It may have killed a man.
- And a dog.
Doggy down?
We've got a situation.
- We've got a situation.
- What are you doing?
Calling for backup.
Didn't you hear the kid?
There's a dangerous creature inside that house.
We don't have backup.
It's just Judy at the station.
And this is no situation.
It's just a couple Tater Tots hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.
I bet you the dead dog would beg to differ.
What was that?
Nothing.
All right.
Time's up, peewees.
- It's Halloween.
We got things to do.
- We do?
No, wait, you can't.
All right, this thing, it has a mouth and it comes out and grabs things and pulls them in and eats them.
Yeah, like this:
Okay, okay, okay.
The thing is we're trying to make this sound more real than it normally would.
Problem is it sounds kind of not real.
- So we'll see you later.
- No.
All right.
I'll show you.
But if things get out of hand...
We'll aim for Bigfoot.
That's loaded.
He's hopping.
Smart house.
Hey.
You
- Both of you.
Come here.
Bring it to the car.
Come on.
I'm gonna forget you throwing that rock because that dance was pretty funny.
But next time any of you mess with this guy's house all three of you are going in the hole, you got it?
Now, I'll give you 10 seconds to march.
But we need your help.
It's your job to help us.
- One.
- Come on.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
That's tender.
My house is right over there.
So much for relying on the government.
Yeah, I know.
I hate the government.
- Dude, we're screwed.
- No, we're not.
We'll go to an expert.
You're looking at the three-time, tri-state over-14 "Thou Art Dead" champion.
His name is Reginald Skulinski.
But they call him Skull.
- Who's "they"?
- Me and DJ.
- Yeah.
- He's the smartest guy on earth.
So let's go talk to him.
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny.
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on.
Hold up.
Skull is in the game zone right now.
You don't wanna mess with him when he's in the game zone.
Fine, so how long is he gonna be playing?
Die.
Die.
Who knows?
He once played for four days straight on one quarter, a gallon of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.
The man's a legend.
Well, if he's not coming out of the game zone, then we are going in.
- What?
Hey, what are you-?
- What?
Jenny, no.
It's like you're not gonna- You're not gonna do it.
Like-
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die.
Watch out.
Did you see that?
I just chopped off your head again.
Your head's rolling.
You can't see it, your eyes are on your head.
- Sir?
- What?
I'm busy playing a video game without even looking at the screen.
What?
Old man Nebbercracker's house is possessed.
I need to know how to destroy it before it kills people.
Calm down.
You make me wanna throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.
Oh, you like the steel of my blade?
It's so cold.
Possessed house, you say?
In my travels to the video store and comic-book conventions I've seen many strange and wondrous things.
And I've heard tell of man-made structures becoming possessed by a human soul so that the spirit becomes merged with wood and brick creating a rare form of monster known as Domus mactabilis.
The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.
We're its murderous enemies.
Have fun getting killed.
Run, coward.
Look at that blood.
So how do we kill it?
You've gotta strike at the source of life: the heart.
But houses don't have hearts.
Yes!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You might be right about that.
Sorry, children, but I've got some very important business to take care of.
I won't be seeing you later.
Thou art dead.
So we need to strike at the heart.
Yeah, but where are we gonna find a heart inside a house?
Ever since Nebbercracker died there's been smoke coming out of that chimney.
The furnace.
The furnace is the heart.
If we wanna put out the fire, we're gonna have to go inside.
Without getting chewed to pieces.
- Dummy.
- Hey, I was just doodling.
No, Chowder, this is it.
First, we build a dummy.
We fill the dummy with a few gallons of cold medicine.
- Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy.
- Say what?
Feed the dummy to the house, house eats the medicine, goes to sleep.
- Look at this.
- We get in, douse the fire and get out.
- Questions?
- Yes, are you nuts?
I don't wanna steal drugs from my father I don't wanna go inside a monster and I don't wanna die.
- I say it's worth a shot.
- Yes, I agree, let's do it.
Hey, but I wanted that one.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Yes.
- Chowder.
Quiet.
- Sorry.
Go.
Whoopsie-daisy.
All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy, I'm gonna move you into position.
You don't be scared.
That's not how I trained you.
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.
Chowder, come on.
Okay.
Yes.
Trick or treat.
Plug it in.
So close.
Littering, loitering, vandalism, vagrancy-
- And treason.
- No, not treason.
- You sure?
Because in the book-
- I'm sure.
All right, kids, out of the trash cans.
Let's go.
Come on.
You heard the big guy.
You see the light.
Walk towards it.
Come on, keep it moving.
All right, drop your weapons.
Pass them to me.
Come on.
- I will shoot you.
- Well, lookie we got here.
You stay here, I'm checking this out.
I am on it.
Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me?
Huh, tough girl?
You disrespecting the badge?
You don't want none of this.
I'm telling you.
Test me.
Please.
Y'all wanna test me?
I am the police.
I know you're a thug.
Them brown eyes...
I see it in your eyes.
That's it.
That is it.
You got something to say, Porky, huh?
- That's it, we're taking them in.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Where we taking them?
- To jail.
Let's go.
You hear that?
You guys are going to jail.
But, officer, you've gotta believe us.
Yeah, 2-percent, you got the right to shut up.
- Okay, the house is a monster.
- And to think I believed you.
Hey, listen, I'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.
I mean, kind of a cop.
He has a gun.
Yeah.
They're gonna love you downtown, Jughead.
We are supercops.
Yeah.
That's why I live in a condo.
Supercop.
Super-duper-duper-cop.
Super-
- You hear that?
- That's my stomach.
I'm starving.
No, no.
That sounds like the dangerous creature.
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Oh, my gosh.
This is like trying to wrangle a puppy.
All right, I'll be back.
- You guys, stop.
- Hey, guys.
- No.
Get out of there.
- No, don't go in there.
What?
I tell you.
Super-roll.
- Stop.
Stop.
- Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
You don't know what's up with that house.
Where you at, spooky creature?
I'm gonna find you.
Freeze tree.
Hey, what you doing?
You can't do that.
Not to an officer, brother.
That is illegal.
- I'm coming, buddy.
- Put me down!
- I'm gonna go get backup.
- I thought there was no backup.
I'm getting Judy.
Judy!
Help!
Mama!
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
- I think I'm having a stroke.
- Just try to stay calm, okay?
We'll be all right if we just stay calm.
I'm too young to die!
Jenny.
I've always loved you.
- Chowder!
- Sorry.
Mama!
I can't look.
Guys, come on.
Let's go.
We're dead.
You've killed us and now we're dead.
I don't think the house knows that we're in here.
I bet it thinks we're still in the car.
Listen.
It sounds like it's sleeping.
The only way that we're gonna get out of here alive is if we find the heart, we put out the fire.
Maybe we should examine our other options.
Sure.
Other option:
We wait here and do nothing until it wakes up and eats us.
Find the heart, put out the fire.
Got it.
Explosives.
That's so cool.
- He was watching me.
- DJ.
Did you ever see a wife?
People used to say he had one but he fattened her up and he ate her.
"Demolition squad."
Sorry.
Come on.
Be quiet.
Don't worry, I have a very light step.
There.
Right there.
Shoot it.
What?
I thought if I shot the heart, that-
- That's not the heart.
- Then what is it?
Well, if those are the teeth and that's the tongue then that must be the uvula.
So it's a girl house.
What?
No.
It stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.
Not me.
No.
Okay.
Let's move.
We need to move quickly and quietly.
Don't touch anything.
And stay together-
- DJ!
- Wait.
DJ.
I'll save you.
Chowder, knock it off.
Sorry.
I thought you were
- DJ!
- Chowder, it's a toy.
- Oh, yeah.
Where's DJ?
- DJ.
- Over here.
Look at all these toys.
This must be where Nebbercracker kept his stash.
"Stash."
I think you guys should have a look at this.
- The key.
- Come on, we don't have time for this.
Yeah, we've gotta find a way out of here.
What are you doing?
We have a Ping-Pong table in our basement.
Constance.
Holy moly.
He really did eat her.
Couldn't have.
Her whole body is buried in cement.
Look at all this stuff.
Why would he build her a shrine if he murdered her?
Maybe he just felt guilty or something.
DJ, can we please get out of here?
I always knew you were hiding something, Mr. Nebbercracker.
DJ.
Way to go, big nose.
- It's awake.
- Run!
Hide.
Hey, I know that sound.
My ball.
Where are you going?
Come here.
- Chowder, come back.
- You get back here.
Gotcha.
Killer Slinkys!
- Chowder.
- Leave me alone!
DJ!
Help!
Oh, no.
Get off.
Jenny.
Chowder.
Come on, Chowder, grab on.
Gotcha.
DJ, look out!
No!
The uvula.
- DJ-
- Chowder.
Mommy!
Gross.
Did we just get upchucked?
The uvula, nature's emergency exit.
That's it.
Another great idea, DJ.
Brilliant.
What do you want from me, Chowder?
I don't see you coming up with any big ideas.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Do you wanna hear my big idea?
I'm going home to make a pretzel sandwich.
See you.
Chowder, the house is still alive and you're gonna wuss out?
I risked my life for you.
I stole drugs for you and I could've died in there.
- Yeah, me too.
You're the one that killed Nebbercracker in the first place.
- Getting your ball back.
- You guys.
Stop fighting.
You're acting like babies.
We are babies.
What were we thinking?
We tried to put a house to sleep with cold medicine.
- How lame can you get?
- Where are you going?
I'm going home.
I suck.
DJ.
At least it's an ambulance.
DJ?
It's a ghost.
Begone.
Fie.
Begone yourself.
Get away.
He's not a ghost.
He's not dead.
I'm not a murderer.
Of course I'm not dead.
Who said I was dead?
You'll be dead if you don't scram.
- Come on, DJ.
- Let's hurry.
Don't you know what day this is?
I'm running out of time.
I'm running out of time.
Honey I'm home.
Oh, look at you, dear.
Your shingles are all ruffled and your windows are cracked.
Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart.
It's no problem at all.
It's her.
The house is her.
- DJ, what are you doing?
- Wait.
Come on.
- Come back.
- Where you going?
Nothing paint and varnish can't handle.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know about Constance.
You what?
What do you know?
You don't know anything.
You were in my house?
You-
You didn't kill her, did you?
I love her so much.
Hello?
It's okay.
I can take you away from here.
Would you like that?
Yes.
There we go.
Won't be long now.
All right.
Okay, open your eyes.
- Now, it's not much, I know, but just-
- Darling.
Get away from my house!
I'm gonna rip them to bits.
Help.
- Constance.
- Help.
Help.
- What's wrong?
Are you hurt?
- Hurt?
Yes, I'm hurt.
Those criminals are attacking our house.
- Trick or treat.
- Now, now they're just kids, dear.
- It's Halloween.
- No, no, no.
It's my house, and they're hurting me.
Constance, look at me.
Look at me.
As long as I'm here, I will never let anyone hurt you.
- Constance.
- Sucker.
You vandals.
- Eat this.
- You hooligans.
- I'll get you.
- Constance, no!
So I finished the house.
She would've wanted that.
She died, but she didn't leave.
And that night that one night of every year I had to take precautions.
- Trick or treat.
- I had to.
- Sucker.
- I had to.
Hey!
Get a-
Stay away from my house!
She attacks anyone who comes near.
Go.
I'm coming, dear.
Go.
No, no, no, wait.
I can't let you do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.
I know that you've been protecting us all these years.
But now it's our turn to protect you.
Let her go.
But if I let her go then I'll have no one.
That's not true.
Constance, no!
Come on.
The house is alive!
This way.
This way.
Come on.
You guys, come on.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to slow the house down.
Move it, pork chop.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Mr. Nebbercracker.
Come on.
I can't.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Hurry.
Go on.
I'll be all right.
Oh, man.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
You stay away from those children, Constance!
Constance.
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, now...
There, there, girl.
My sweet.
You've been a bad girl, haven't you?
You've hurt people.
Oh, Constance.
Oh, we've always known this day would come.
Haven't we?
I have to make things right.
I have to make things right.
Constance.
I've always done what's best for you, haven't I?
Haven't I, girl?
Come on, let's move.
Oh, Constance.
Let this be the right thing to do.
Leave him alone!
Yeah, get your grubby branches off the old man!
Take that!
And that!
Mr. Nebbercracker.
Oh, kid, come here.
- Take this.
- What?
You have to help me.
Please.
I know you can do it.
Go on.
Go.
Hurry.
How do you know how to drive this thing?
I don't.
The chimney.
The chimney leads to the heart.
Jenny!
Jenny.
Are you all right?
I'm not sure.
DJ, get rid of that thing.
I'm working on it.
Chowder, I need you to get the house down under that crane.
Think you could do that?
Piece of cake.
Come on.
You think you can just mess with my friends?
DJ, look.
Mommy.
Chowder.
Come in, Chowder.
Chowder, buddy?
Hey, guys.
Look who just won.
It's me, the screw-up.
Way to go, Chowder, you did it!
Look at me.
Look at Chowder.
Oh, yeah.
- Sorry.
- Guys, come on.
Yes.
Look at me.
You can't do that.
That's not fair.
No.
Get on the top.
Help!
That's it, Chowder.
Keep her coming.
You ain't nothing.
You're a shack.
You're an outhouse.
No!
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Go.
I kissed a girl.
I kissed a girl on the lips.
Guys.
Any time now.
Sorry.
DJ, hurry.
I'm flying!
- On three, light the dynamite.
- Okay, I got it.
- One.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Two.
- Yes.
Thr-
DJ!
Three!
Do you guys hear something?
It's over there.
Come on.
Oh, my dear.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry, Mr. Nebbercracker, about your house and your wife.
Your house-wife.
Forty-five years.
We have been trapped for 45 years.
And now we're free.
We're free.
Thank you, friend.
Thank you all.
We're free.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Happy Halloween.
Next.
What happened to Nebbercracker's house?
It turned into a monster, so I blew it up.
Trick or treat.
We're gonna need a tricycle.
One tricycle, coming up.
Tricycle.
Tricycle.
- Tricycle.
- Hello, tricycle.
I missed you so much.
- Thank you, mister.
- Goodbye, now.
- Happy Halloween.
- Come on.
- Mom.
There's my mom.
- Jenny!
- One second.
- Okay.
So...
We should hang out again.
Soon.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
See you.
Good luck with the puberty.
She grabbed my butt.
That's nice, Chowder.
Hey, Mr. Nebbercracker.
It's time to go.
Oh, you go on.
I've got some work to do.
All right.
Thanks.
- I'll see you around.
- All right.
Bye.
Hey.
Stay off my lawn.
I'm just kidding.
- You think he'll be okay?
- Yeah.
He'll be fine.
He'll go on vacation, get some color, maybe he'll meet someone new.
This time, maybe a nice beach house.
Hey, DJ, look who's here.
- Yes, I can see that, thank you.
- No biggie.
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, Dad.
What the heck kind-?
No, don't tell me.
Let me guess.
It's...
- Dirty pirates?
- That's it.
Dirty pirates.
Fun, fun.
Oh, you look adorable.
Have fun tonight.
You know, you were right.
We're definitely too old for trick-or-treating.
Oh, yeah.
No question about it.
On the other hand we've been working all night.
Candy time?
Candy time.
We're back.
Yes.
Candy.
- Did we just get-?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's Halloween, right?
What do you say you and I go out and "inspect" some candy, huh?
We should go eat some candy too.
That's a good idea.
Okay.
All right.
Let's go eat some candy.
Lots of yummy candy.
Like carrots.
All right, where's the car?
And that is how I slayed that mystical dragon.
Oh, yeah?
That's great.
Come on, baby.
We're out of here.
Not so fast, Bones.
Times have changed.
Skull's not like you.
He gives me the respect I deserve and makes time for me.
Whatever.
Bones!
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Hello, fence.
Hello, leaves.
Hello, sky.
Get off my lawn!
Trespasser.
Do you want to be eaten alive?
- No.
- Then get out of here!
My trike.
Stay away from my house!
- DJ!
- We're gonna be late.
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming.
I'm coming.
October 30th: another tricycle.
I'm coming.
Mom.
Mom, he did it again.
He took another tricycle.
Okay, honey, we've talked about this.
You cannot stay up in your room all day staring at an old man through a telescope.
But, Mom, there's something wrong with that house.
I'm serious.
What was that?
I'm serious.
His voice sounds funny.
Someone is hitting puberty.
"What's happening to my body?" Right, buddy?
Maybe you should come with us.
Oh, the boy's too busy.
He's got his spying to do.
I'm not spying.
Well...
"Well..." That's okay, buddy.
When I was your age, I did exactly the same thing.
Of course, it was with binoculars and involved the lovely Jensen twins.
Neither of which was as lovely as your beautiful mother.
Will you be an angel and help me bring out the incisor?
- The incisor.
- Hold this.
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.
Elizabeth will be here in a few hours.
If anything happens, call the police and hide.
He knows that.
See you tomorrow night.
- What have you done?
- Just let me drive this thing, will you?
- Where is DJ?
Where's DJ?
- I'm fine.
You would be so happy if he was under the car, wouldn't you?
Sorry.
It's hard to see with the mask on.
Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder?
Why did you put up your window?
- Chowder.
- It's aerodynamic.
- Hi, DJ.
- We've got to make time.
The children.
The children.
- What children?
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Tell him you love him, dear.
- He knows that.
- Tell your son you love him.
- I don't wanna tell him.
- He knows I love him.
- He's your son.
- You have to say it.
Roll it down.
- We're gonna be late.
We both love you.
- That includes your dad.
- That's right.
- He's had enough kisses.
- Blow him a kiss.
- Blow him a kiss.
- Goodbye.
Cheer up.
It's almost Halloween.
In one day and three hours, it's candy time.
Okay?
- Check it out, I got a new ball.
- Cool.
Oh, speaking of which, have you decided?
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?
Chowder.
I don't think I'm going trick-or-treating this year.
What?
Come on, you're gonna break a six-year streak.
Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.
Maybe I'm getting too grown-up.
Three seconds on the clock.
I'm playing basketball.
It's time for an in-your-face disgrace.
- Are you okay?
- My nose is in my brains.
Let me see.
Oh, my God.
- What?
- You're a dork.
Where's my ball?
Oh, no.
- Sorry, man.
- Wait, wait.
DJ.
You're a grownup now, you go get it.
Chowder, your ball just landed on Nebbercracker's lawn.
It doesn't exist anymore.
I paid $28 for that ball.
I raked 10 yards and asked my mom for a dollar 26 times.
I never worked that hard in my life-
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.
- So?
- So maybe he's sleeping.
All right, I'll do it.
I'll never forget this.
Hurry, though.
Go.
You.
- No.
- DJ, run!
Get the ball and run!
You're so close.
What have you done?
- Just nudge it over here.
- I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I didn't mean-
You are dead.
DJ, come on, come on!
- Chowder.
- Come on, DJ.
Help.
Chowder.
Help.
Help.
- You think you can terrorize my lawn?
- No, I'm sorry.
- You wanna be a dead person?
- No.
I love life.
This place is not a playground for children.
- Got it from now on.
- This is my house!
Why can't you respect that?
Why can't you just stay away from-?
Push.
No siren.
Never a good sign.
I'm a murderer.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?
When it's an accident, they call it manslaughter.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Great.
