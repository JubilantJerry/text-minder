Has been disappeared for a long time
With this, I'm invincible now
So what
People will still look down on us
The situation will change
Then despise us now
And they'll praise us to tomorrow
Once you've been a pimp
Always a pimp
Don't talk so much, let's celebrate
Damn it, you want to be praised
Praised your ass
Why?
It looks like me
It's your alright

My wife?
Where's she?
Left hand side
Left, right, left
At my left
I'll buy you a drink someday
No, I mean she's coming from my left
Furthermore, she has told me something about you
What did she say?
Move a few steps forward
That's too much
Retreat one step
Alright now?
Yes
What are you doing?
What are you trying to do?
What has my wife told you?
She said you're stupid with all the fats in your body
You...
Let me down...
This shows you're very stupid
I just don't understand that
How can your body worth 20 taels of gold

You are not after my armour
Who wants your ragged armour?
Not this one, the "lnvincible Armour"
"lnvincible Armour"
What are you say?
Invincible Armour
"lnvincible Armour"?
Where's it?
It is snatched by others
Who has snatched it?
You think I'll be so stupid to tell you
Hurry
It is because of the armour
You married your wife
Yes, I've chased her for 9 years
Before our marriage
You've started to chase her at 1 2?
Yes
I matured earlier than the others
Boy, that's tough
It's tough, during the 17 years
I've to face her everyday

It's a present from Popo
The ultimate child of Marco Polo
I am so sorry
What are you going to do now?
I was wrong, please kill me
It won't be so easy
No, I want you to stay
With me all the time
That's worse than death
What?
Nothing
Your punishment
Is not to sleep with me tonight
Good, please prolong my punishment what?
You dirty guy
I'm here to rescue you
Let's share our future profit
By 3:7, alright?
Think about it
It's better to stay here
What's wrong about here?
To face the old lady every day
Alright
Twist your left hand twice
Then the fight thrice
Take if out, then put it back, right
Why doesn't it work?
Who has slapped you?
You

You don't seem to be stupid
Tiger, please say it again
Think it yourself
Twist your left hand twice
Then the right hand
My dear, I won't do it again
Don't be frightened, stand up
You dirty guy
You don't afraid of this?
I'll only afraid if my wife holds it
But not you
Frog, you're a traitor

Remember, we'll share the armour equally
Alright, be careful
He's fierce even without the armour
His Kung-fu is very powerful
Nothing's more fierce than this
What's it?
This is the "Smiling Poison"
People will get killed
With a smile when they've taken it
Are you sure you'll make it?
What do the people call me?
"3 tricks" kid
Yes, I always kill people
Within 3 tricks
Which 3 tricks are you going to use?
For him 2 will be enough
The first one, make him hold this bow
No, my tea isn't poisoned, try it
See, nothing
Try it
The second trick he'll die with a sweet smile
If these two tricks don't work
I'll let his right hand hold the bowl
The left hand hold my hand
And the third trick
Shortly, you're very smart
Or how can I be your partner
He... he's poisoned the tea
The tea is poisoned
No, how can my tea be poisoned
Taste it
You'll like it
I'll try it if you don't trust me
Tiger, let me get him
You still want to run
Why do you want to poison us?
Speak
I...
I just want to get the "lnvincible Armour"
Why do you want to get it?
You got many enemies?
No, I take it for sale
Who'll buy it?
"Coffin King" and the "Bandit Brothers"
The "Bandit Brothers"?
Those two beasts
You take this armour just for money
Do something for me

What you want him to do?
Find out where is the "Multi-hand chick"
And inform me in the "Rumour Town"
Alright?

Since so many people like the armour
Let's reproduce more for sales
Then we'll earn a lot of money
Yes, we'll be alright with my brain your muscles
That's right
But there're two guys
We better watch out
Which two?
The "Bandit Brothers"?
They're very fierce
The elder one is called the "Panther"
The younger brother is the "Smiling Tiger"
They're all fierce guys
But the most fierce one
Is their father?
The "White-brow Monk"
His "Crab-fist style" has never been
Defeated before
Even you and I can't beat him
Never try, never know
Don't worry, with my clever brain
I'll think out a trick to beat him
You're smart Of course
Only a stupid fool with say

Leaving?
It won't be so easy
Come out, my husband
Husband?

Well, have you worked it out?
What?
Let's go and find the Armour
No
You've broken your words...
You dirty guy
Those are yours
What for?
These are given by your wife
Let's share our profit by 3:7, take it
Coming... together with a kid
Two makes it a double
Remember, we'll share the armour equally
Alright, be careful
He's fierce even without the armour
His Kung-fu is very powerful
Nothing's more fierce than this
What's it?
This is the "Smiling Poison"
People will get killed
With a smile when they've taken it
Are you sure you'll make it?
What do the people call me?
"3 tricks" kid
Yes, I always kill people
Within 3 tricks
Which 3 tricks are you going to use?
For him 2 will be enough
The first one, make him hold this bow
No, my tea isn't poisoned, try it
See, nothing
Try it
The second trick he'll die with a sweet smile
If these two tricks don't work
I'll let his right hand hold the bowl
The left hand hold my hand
And the third trick
Shortly, you're very smart
Or how can I be your partner
He... he's poisoned the tea
The tea is poisoned
No, how can my tea be poisoned
Taste it
You'll like it
I'll try it if you don't trust me
Tiger, let me get him
You still want to run
Why do you want to poison us?
Speak
I...
I just want to get the "lnvincible Armour"
Why do you want to get it?
You got many enemies?
No, I take it for sale
Who'll buy it?
"Coffin King" and the "Bandit Brothers"
The "Bandit Brothers"?
Those two beasts
You take this armour just for money
Do something for me
I'll give you money
Good, if for money
What you want him to do?
Find out where is the "Multi-hand chick"
And inform me in the "Rumour Town"
Alright?
Yes
This will be yours if you find her
Go...
Tiger, what shall we do now?
Since so many people like the armour
Let's reproduce more for sales
Then we'll earn a lot of money
Yes, we'll be alright with my brain your muscles
That's right
But there're two guys
We better watch out
Which two?
The "Bandit Brothers"?
They're very fierce
The elder one is called the "Panther"
The younger brother is the "Smiling Tiger"
They're all fierce guys
But the most fierce one
Is their father?
The "White-brow Monk"
His "Crab-fist style" has never been
Defeated before
Even you and I can't beat him
Never try, never know
Don't worry, with my clever brain
I'll think out a trick to beat him
You're smart Of course
Only a stupid fool with say
That he's clever
Me the clever "Panther"
Have never been fooled before
The bitch have not yet arrived
You see anything?
No, not even a trace

Money?
Don't you know?

I'm leaving now
Leaving?
It won't be so easy
Come out, my husband
Husband?
Who... which one...
Go to bring out the high-price horse
A long-distant horse or a short-distant one
A short-distant one, it's not for the Derby

Who'll get 3 and who'll get 7?
Of course I'll get 7
We're agreed before
Really?
I haven't agreed

To stay together anyway
We'll have a duel, if you win you'll have the money I win, I'll take the money I know that you'll surely suggest this
I've got one too
You've learnt it I've learnt nothing but all your dirty tricks

Simple, I'll take you back to your wife
Good evening Sidney
Good evening Miss Courtney, just giving your door a bit of a touch up
Had a nice holiday?
I spent seven days in sunny Spain
- Pardon?
- Sunny Spain
- That sounds nice
- It rained
Oh, I am sorry!
Still I expect you enjoyed all those exotic Spanish dishes
- I got food poisoning
- Oh sorry
Did it rain every day?
Oh no!
When I got food poisoning the sun came out
When I got better, it went back in
Apart from the day before we left.
That was absolutely glorious
- Well at least you had one good day
- I got sunburnt
What a pity!
- Hello Sid
- Mr. Brown, welcome back
- Ta, is she in?
- I've creamed out your bin
- No, is she in?
- Yeah, but she's in a shocking temper
- I'll see her later then
- Glad to be back?
Yeah, I shall miss my old class
But I shall enjoy the challenge of starting again with fresh minds
I wonder how many different nationalities I'll have to deal with this term?
Good evening

I am most happy to be seeing you again
Anna, Ranjeet!
What are you doing here?
We failed our exam but we are coming back for more lessons
That is correct!
Like Roberty Bruce say
If at first you are not succeeding, try, try
Again!
If at first you are not succeeding...
Never mind
Were you not expecting us?
No, the authorities don't notify the individual teachers of the results
And as usual Miss Courtney has kept me in the dark
She took the lights out?
No, she never told me!
This is Zoltan, Ranjeet
Delighted to be making your acquaintance
What a nice man!
He is giving me a present
He wants you to read out something from his phrase book
A thousand apologies
Waiter my soup is cold
Pleased to meet you
Thank you
Good and this is Anna
How do you do?
Yes, Thank you
Would you both like to sit down
This time I sit at front, then I can be learning quicker
I will be sitting in my accustomed place
Well, I was hoping that I had a hundred percent pass record
But still, two failures out of ten isn't bad
Good evening master
Four failures out of ten
Jamila, you failed
Sorry Master
But maybe next time I shall be winning
I'm sure you mean winning
- And you, Taro
- Ah so
Loss of face

Well, as you can see you re not alone
This is Zoltan
Jamila, and Taro

That's more than I can say for you
- Por favor?
- Never mind
This is Zoltan!
This is Juan
How you do?
Is for me?
He's really saying he's pleased to meet you
He doesn't speak English
It's all right!
I teach him
That would be like the blind leading the blind
Blind
He not see!

Sit down
Ok!
I sit here
- Good afton
- Good evening

What is matter?
There is wrong something with me?
There is wrong nothing with you

Teacher?
You are too young to be teacher
Thank you

You're sitting next to Juan, behind you is Ranjeet
At the back are Taro and Jamila
She is Anna and he is Zoltan
And I am Ali
- Ali, not you as well
- As well as what please?
- You failed?
- Yes
I am getting twenty out of one hundred
That's nothing to be proud about
You're supposed to get at least fifty to pass!
Twenty is disgraceful
Last year I am getting nothing at all
So I am doing better!
I sit
- Scuse please!
Get up
- What for?
- That is my seat
- I not see your name on seat
Get your big Spanish bottom out of my chair
You no talk me like that!
I punch you
That's enough!
Seats are not reservable
Sit somewhere else, Ali
Ok, I sit at the back
You big spanish bottom
We'll wait a few more moments in case there are any more new students
It's just like old times
It's a big surprise, eh professori?
I am not disappointed to be back
- Who is that?
- This is Ingrid!
She is Swedish
She is also sitting in my seat
- You will move yes?
- I will move no
- You can sit next to me
- No, you sit next to me
That's right!
You sit beside Max and Giovanni because I want to sit here
I'm sorry Danielle!
But I think it's important the new students sit at the front
- I don't like you
- I'm so worried
You can come and sit next to me
- Sit between us
- Ok
Well I must say that I'm extremely disappointed in you all
It's not your fault professori!
We not pass because we're stupid
- And what does that make me?
- More stupid
Exactly!
Out of ten students I've nine failures
Vely solly I'm rate
Congratulations!
You are getting ten out of ten
Well I really don't know what to say
Oh blimey, if you are not knowing what to say
How are you going to be teaching us?
- I'll ignore that stupid remark
- Jolly good
Because you have all failed, I have failed
It's perfectly true
This term, I want much more effort from all of you
You must all pull your socks up
It's all right
No Juan, I was speaking figuratively
- Por favor
- Never mind
You must all concentrate much harder this term
We shall start at the beginning again
And this time I shall be giving twice as much homework as last time
I want a hundred per cent effort from all of you
Now tonight I want you each to tell me what you did during the holidays
- Please?
- Yes Zoltan
I do not understand what you are saying
Never mind!
Just keep quiet and listen
Never mind
I speak
No speak
- Thank you Juan
- It's all right
Now, what have you been doing with yourself, Jamila?
I went on holidays to visit all my family
- You went to Bombay?
- No Birmingham
Birmingham, the Mecca of the Midlands
- And you Taro?
- Ah so
What did you get up to?
Went on fishing holiday
- Good, did you catch anything?
- Catcho heavy coldo
Did you enjoy your break, Ali?
I am not breaking anything
- The holiday
- Jolly good
I am learning how to be driving a motor car
Good, that's very useful!
When do you take your test?
Oh blimey
I'm already failing my test
The examiner man was jumping out of the car
When I was going down a hill
- I expect you were going too fast
- No, I was going backwards
- What did you do Su Lee?
- Spent time lighting
- Lighting what?
- Lighting book
Ah book
What sort of book are you lighting, writing?
Is called The Democratic way of Life
All about glorious freedom-loving Chinese
I see, a work of fiction
Tell us what you did with yourself Ranjeet
I have been looking after my cousin while her husband has been away
Very commendable
He is being discharged this week
Discharged?
He's been in hospital?
No, prison
And he is being sent to prison for something he didn't do
- What really didn't he do?
- He didn't run fast enough
Quiet!
Tell us what you did Giovanni
I went to Marsgate
- Margate
- Scusi
I met this fantastic girl
She had the biggest...
I'm sure we all get your meaning
Every day we used to go on the sand for a bit
- For a while
- Scusi?
To go on the sands for a while
To go on the sands for a bit can imply you were, well doing something naughty
That's right, we were very naughty on the sand
Silence!
Mr. Brown, miss Courtney wants you right away
Thank you Sid
You can have an early tea break and we'll continue with this later
- Please
- Yes Zoltan
No, you must try to speak!
Speak
You
- Girl
- Yes please
- No you re not a girl
- You
Ah, you have a girl friend
- I understand, go on
- Girl English
An English girl
- You
- Me
You want me to write a letter to your girl?
Please
What do you want me to write?
What I write?
I think I get the general idea
Sidney!
Yes Miss Courtney
Did you tell Mr. Brown I wanted to see him?
Yeah definitely
I think this should be all right
Dear Miss, I'm writing to tell you of my feelings for you
I think you are beautiful
I want to hold you in my arms and kiss you
Please say you feel the same about me
All my love
Yes!
Thank you
- What is going on here?
- Nothing
It certainly didn't sound like nothing
I was writing a letter for Zoltan to his girl friend
He was showing me his appreciation in Hungarian
Kindly leave us
Go, I said go!
Go
Now Mr. Brown
I understand none of your previous students
Passed their lower Cambridge Certificate
I think there were a few near misses
That's not good enough
Obviously Mr. Brown, you are sadly lacking
In the necessary qualities required to teach English
- Just a moment
- Don't interrupt
I shall be keeping a very close eye on you this term, Mr. Brown
Unless I see a marked improvement, out you go
- It's not...
- I have no wish to listen to feeble excuses
Pompous old cow
- What was that?
- I said I'm just going now
Hey, you not speak nothing?
He is not knowing the English as well as what we are knowing
- I speak with him
- Blimey, he speak Hungryarian
Sure I speak Hunarian
- Football
- Football
- Puskas
- Pele
- Kempes
- Beckenbauer
- Bobby Lee Shutkan
- Bobby Lee Moor
You see, I told you I speak the language
You like England?
Ya!
I also very much like teacher
- You not make the eyes at Mr. Brown
- If I want I will
Mr. Brown does not like the blond ladies
Swedish girls are the beautifullest
Swedish girls are too big in the bosoms
French girls are too big in the mouth
In China, looks are not important
It is brains and intellect that matter
- Absolument
- Su Lee is right
We women are not symbols for sex
- You agree Jamila?
- I not understand
We Women are not here to give the men the pleasure
I like give men pleasure
Trying to find a few winners?
No I'm trying to find out if I can afford to leave the wife
- Pardon?
- Premium bonds
A hundred thousand pounds!
I could be lucky
Somebody's got to win it
- How many bonds have you got?
- One
You're as bad as me!
I've only got one
One, double F, two, three, two, three, two
You've got a good memory
It's not a difficult one
One, double F, two, three, two, three, two
That's right
- That's it
- That's what?
One, double F, two, three, two, three, two
I don't believe it
Are you sure that you got the right cucumber?
- Cucumber?
- The number
Positive!
Look
One, double F, two, three, two, three, two
That's right!
You've won a hundred thousand pounds
- What are you going to do?
- What am I going to do
Celebrate of course
- Gladys
- Yes Mr. Brown
Coffees all round
Everybody please!
I want to read you all my letter of resignation
No, no!
I'm definitely resigning
With one hundred thousand pounds, I no longer need to teach English
Dear Dracula
This is to inform you
That I think you are a rude, obnoxious and self-opinionated old dragon
And if I ever see you again, it will be too soon
Yours disrespectfully, Jeremy Brown
- Ali
- Yes please
See that Miss Courtney gets this straight away
Jelly good
Thank you
- Please
- Oh yes Zoltan, your letter
Glad, where's Sid's paper?
- He went and took it with him
- Took it with him?
- I got a paper Mr. Brown
- Great Max, thank you
Here it is, one hundred thousand pounds
Today's number is One E, F, two, three
Wait a minute!
That's not right!
It should be one double F
We apologize for the misprint printed out early in the day
I have not won anything
- So you won't be resignating after all
- Resigning
That letter...
Hello please
Ali, the letter to Miss Courtney
- She is not in the office
- Thank God
Mr. Brown, Mr. Nadim!
Did you want to see me?
- No
- Yes please!
This is for you
Thank you
I'd like a word with you Mr. Brown
I'll have you in the office
Close the door
I'll just see what this letter is first
I wouldn't do that!
You don't know where it's been!
It could be full of germs
Don't be so ridiculous
I seem to recognize this writing
It looks like yours, Mr. Brown
No, it's nothing like mine!
Itjust looks like mine
- Well I'd better open it
- I think I'll go
I haven't finished with you yet
You will have when you read that letter
- I beg you pardon?
- Nothing
Good Heavens
Miss Courtney
I've never read anything like it in my life
- I can explain...
- Just listen to this
I'd rather not
Dear Miss, I'm writing to tell you of my feelings for you
You see I thought I'd won...
Pardon?
I want to hold you in my arms and kiss you
You did write this letter, Mr. Brown
Well I...
Not to you
It's the letter you wrote for that Hungarian student
- Yes, you see what must have happened
- You don't need to go on
Obviously he's been smitten by my charm and beauty
- Pardon?
- I have told you before Mr. Brown
I do have a strange fascination for the opposite sex
Oh yes very strange
You may not believe this, Mr. Brown
But when I was a young girl I was very plain
A cup of tea Gladys, please
Everything ok, Mr. Brown?
Yes!
I must have put Zoltan's letter to his girl friend in my envelop to Miss Courtney
- He's not going to be very happy
- Why not?
He's gonna give the letter you write to Miss Courtney to his girlfriend!
Principal's office
Good evening Sidney
Good evening Miss Courtney, just giving your door a bit of a touch up
Had a nice holiday?
I spent seven days in sunny Spain
- Pardon?
- Sunny Spain
- That sounds nice
- It rained
Oh, I am sorry!
Still I expect you enjoyed all those exotic Spanish dishes
- I got food poisoning
- Oh sorry
Did it rain every day?
Oh no!
When I got food poisoning the sun came out
When I got better, it went back in
Apart from the day before we left.
That was absolutely glorious
- Well at least you had one good day
- I got sunburnt
What a pity!
- Hello Sid
- Mr. Brown, welcome back
- Ta, is she in?
- I've creamed out your bin
- No, is she in?
- Yeah, but she's in a shocking temper
- I'll see her later then
- Glad to be back?
Yeah, I shall miss my old class
But I shall enjoy the challenge of starting again with fresh minds
I wonder how many different nationalities I'll have to deal with this term?
Good evening
Pleased to meet you
Thank you
Do you speak English?
- Hungry?
- Igen
You want something to eat?
- Hungry
- Hungary
I'll put you in my register
What is your name?
Your name
- Zoltan Szabo
- Zoltan Szabo
This is yes
This is no
Yes...
No
Good
I am Mr. Brown, your teacher
I hope that was complimentary
Never mind
Do you know any English?
Yes
- Gud sev de kwin
- God Save the Queen
More?
Some more English?
- Pliz, thank you
- Good
- Shtones
- Shtones?
- Rolling Stones?
- Yes
Good evening Mr. Brown
I am most happy to be seeing you again
Anna, Ranjeet!
What are you doing here?
We failed our exam but we are coming back for more lessons
That is correct!
Like Roberty Bruce say
If at first you are not succeeding, try, try
Again!
If at first you are not succeeding...
Never mind
Were you not expecting us?
No the authorities don't notify the individual teachers of the results
And as usual Miss Courtney has kept me in the dark
She took the lights out?
No, she never told me!
This is Zoltan, Ranjeet
Delighted to be making your acquaintance
What a nice man!
He is giving me a present
He wants you to read out something from his phrase book
A thousand apologies
Waiter my soup is cold
Pleased to meet you
Thank you
Good and this is Anna
How do you do?
Yes, Thank you
Would you both like to sit down
This time I sit at front, then I can be learning quicker
I will be sitting in my accustomed place
Well, I was hoping that I had a hundred percent pass record
But still, two failures out of ten isn't bad
Good evening master
Four failures out of ten
Jamila you failed
Sorry Master
But maybe next time I shall be winning
I'm sure you mean winning
- And you, Taro
- Ah so
Loss of face
Not goodo for Japanese
First, considered Hara-kiri
Then decide to como backo for more lessons
But if no pass next time
Just make sure you don't do it on the classroom floor
Well, as you can see you re not alone
This is Zoltan
Jamila, and Taro
- Pleased to meet you
- Good evening
Jamila, you want your place back?
No, I sit at backside with Taro
No Jamila!
You will sit at the back
Backside is what you sit on
No master, what I sit on is chair
Yes, I can see why you failed
Buenas noches everybodies
Juan!
Don't tell me you failed
It's all right!
I not tell you
- You don't need to tell me!
I know
- You plenty smart
That's more than I can say for you
- Por favore?
- Never mind
This is Zoltan!
This is Juan
How you do?
Is for me?
He's really saying he's pleased to meet you
He doesn't speak English
It's all right!
I teach him
That would be like the blind leading the blind
Blind
He not see!
- You feel
- Juan he's not blind
I was just using a..., never mind!
Sit down
Ok!
I sit here
- Good afton
- Good evening
- I here come to English learn
- I come here to learn English
We together sit
No, we can't do that
What is matter?
There is wrong something with me?
There is wrong nothing with you
- I very much like you
- I am your teacher
Teacher?
You are too young to be teacher
Thank you
- Is that your name?
- Yes
- Ingrid Svenson
- Ingrid Svenson
- I take it you are Svedish...
Swedish?
- Ja
- Where from?
- Stockholm
- Stockholm!
And what is yourjob?
- Au pair
Very nice
Where shall we sit you?
There's a place here with me
There is also a place here beside me
Here please
I think we'll sit you at the front for the time being
You're sitting next to Juan, behind you is Ranjeet
At the back are Taro and Jamila
She is Anna and he is Zoltan
And I am Ali
- Ali, not you as well
- As well as what please?
- You failed?
- Yes
I am getting twenty out of one hundred
That's nothing to be proud about
You're supposed to get at least fifty to pass!
Twenty is disgraceful
Last year I am getting nothing at all
So I am doing better!
I sit
- Scuse please!
Get up
- What for?
- That is my seat
- I not see your name on seat
Get your big Spanish bottom out of my chair
You no talk me like that!
I punch you
That's enough!
Seats are not reservable
Sit somewhere else, Ali
Ok, I sit at the back
You big spanish bottom
We'll wait a few more moments in case there are any more new students
Buena Serra
It's just like old times
It's a big surprise, eh professori?
I am not disappointed to be back
- Who is that?
- This is Ingrid!
She is Swedish
She is also sitting in my seat
- You will move yes?
- I will move no
- You can sit next to me
- No, you sit next to me
That's right!
You sit beside Max and Giovanni because I want to sit here
I'm sorry Danielle!
But I think it's important the new students sit at the front
- I don't like you
- I'm so worried
You can come and sit next to me
- Sit between us
- Ok
Well I must say that I'm extremely disappointed in you all
It's not your fault professori!
We not pass because we're stupid
- And what does that make me?
- More stupid
Exactly!
Out of ten students I've nine failures
Vely solly I'm rate
Congratulations!
You are getting ten out of ten
Well I really don't know what to say
Oh blimey, if you are not knowing what to say
How are you going to be teaching us?
- I'll ignore that stupid remark
- Jolly good
Because you have all failed, I have failed
It's perfectly true
This term, I want much more effort from all of you
You must all pull your socks up
It's all right
No Juan, I was speaking figuratively
- Por favore
- Never mind
You must all concentrate much harder this term
We shall start at the beginning again
And this time I shall be giving twice as much homework as last time
I want a hundred per cent effort from all of you
Now tonight I want you each to tell me what you did during the holidays
- Please?
- Yes Zoltan
I do not understand what you are saying
Never mind!
Just keep quiet and listen
Never mind
I speak
No speak
- Thank you Juan
- It's all right
Now, what have you been doing with yourself, Jamila?
I went on holidays to visit all my family
- You went to Bombay?
- No Birmingham
Birmingham, the Mecca of the Midlands
- And you Taro?
- Ah so
What did you get up to?
Went on fishing holiday
- Good, did you catch anything?
- Catcho heavy coldo
Did you enjoy your break Ali?
I am not breaking anything
- The holiday
- Jolly good
I am learning how to be driving a motor car
Good, that's very useful!
When do you take your test?
Oh blimey
I'm already failing my test
The examiner man was jumping out of the car
When I was going down a hill
- I expect you were going too fast
- No, I was going backwards
- What did you do Su Lee?
- Spent time lighting
- Lighting what?
- Lighting book
Ah book
What sort of book are you lighting, writing?
Is called The Democratic way of Life
All about glorious freedom-loving Chinese
I see, a work of fiction
Tell us what you did with yourself Ranjeet
I have been looking after my cousin while her husband has been away
Very commendable
He is being discharged this week
Discharged?
He's been in hospital?
No prison
And he is being sent to prison for something he didn't do
- What really didn't he do?
- He didn't run fast enough
Quiet!
Tell us what you did Giovanni
I went to Marsgate
- Margate
- Scusi
I met this fantastic girl
She had the biggest...
I'm sure we all get your meaning
Every day we used to go on the sand for a bit
- For a while
- Scusi?
To go on the sands for a while
To go on the sands for a bit can imply you were, well doing something naughty
That's right, we were very naughty on the sand
Silence!
Mr. Brown, miss Courtney wants you right away
Thank you Sid
You can have an early tea break and we'll continue with this later
- Please
- Yes Zoltan
No, you must try to speak!
Speak
You
- Girl
- Yes please
- No you re not a girl
- You
Ah, you have a girl friend
- I understand, go on
- Girl English
An English girl
- You
- Me
You want me to write a letter to your girl?
Please
What do you want me to write?
What I write?
I think I get the general idea
Sidney!
Yes Miss Courtney
Did you tell Mr. Brown I wanted to see him?
Yeah definitely
I think this should be all right
Dear Miss, I'm writing to tell you of my feelings for you
I think you are beautiful
I want to hold you in my arms and kiss you
Please say you feel the same about me
All my love
Yes!
Thank you
- What is going on here?
- Nothing
It certainly didn't sound like nothing
I was writing a letter for Zoltan to his girl friend
He was showing me his appreciation in Hungarian
Kindly leave us
Go, I said go!
Go
Now Mr. Brown
I understand none of your previous students
Passed their lower Cambridge Certificate
I think there were a few near misses
That's not good enough
Obviously Mr. Brown, you are sadly lacking
In the necessary qualities required to teach English
- Just a moment
- Don't interrupt
I shall be keeping a very close eye on you this term, Mr. Brown
Unless I see a marked improvement, out you go
- It's not...
- I have no wish to listen to feeble excuses
Pompous old cow
- What was that?
- I said I'm just going now
Hey, you not speak nothing?
He is not knowing the English as well as what we are knowing
- I speak with him
- Blimey, he speak Hungryarian
Sure I speak Hunarian
- Football
- Football
- Puskas
- Pele
- Kepkens
- Beckenball
- Bobby Lee Shutkan
- Bobby Lee Moor
You see, I told you I speak the language
You like England?
Ya!
I also very much like teacher
- You not make the eyes at Mr. Brown
- If I want I will
Mr. Brown does not like the blond ladies
Swedish girls are the beautifullest
Swedish girls are too big in the bosoms
French girls are too big in the mouth
In China, looks are not important
It is brains and intellect that matter
- Absolument
- Su Lee is right
We women are not symbols for sex
- You agree Jamila?
- I not understand
We Women are not here to give the men the pleasure
I like give men pleasure
Trying to find a few winners?
No I'm trying to find out if I can afford to leave the wife
- Pardon?
- Premium bonds
A hundred thousand pounds!
I could be lucky
Somebody's got to win it
- How many bonds have you got?
- One
You're as bad as me!
I've only got one
One, double F, two, three, two, three, two
You've got a good memory
It's not a difficult one
One, double F, two, three, two, three, two
That's right
- That's it
- That's what?
One, double F, two, three, two, three, two
I don't believe it
Are you sure that you got the right cucumber?
- Cucumber?
- The number
Positive!
Look
One, double F, two, three, two, three, two
That's right!
You've won a hundred thousand pounds
- What are you going to do?
- What am I going to do
Celebrate of course
- Gladys
- Yes Mr. Brown
Coffees all round
Everybody please!
I want to read you all my letter of resignation
No, no!
I'm definitely resigning
With one hundred thousand pounds, I no longer need to teach English
Dear Dracula
This is to inform you
That I think you are a rude, obnoxious and self-opinionated old dragon
And if I ever see you again, it will be too soon
Yours disrespectfully, Jeremy Brown
- Ali
- Yes please
See that Miss Courtney gets this straight away
Jelly good
Thank you
- Please
- Oh yes Zoltan, your letter
Glad, where's Sid's paper?
- He went and took it with him
- Took it with him?
- I got a paper Mr. Brown
- Great Max, thank you
Here it is, one hundred thousand pounds
Today's number is One E, F, two, three
Wait a minute!
That's not right!
It should be one double F
We apologize for the misprint printed out early in the day
I have not won anything
- So you won't be resignating after all
- Resigning
That letter...
Hello please
Ali, the letter to Miss Courtney
- She is not in the office
- Thank God
Mr. Brown, Mr. Nadim!
Did you want to see me?
- No
- Yes please!
This is for you
Thank you
I'd like a word with you Mr. Brown
I'll have you in the office
Close the door
I'll just see what this letter is first
I wouldn't do that!
You don't know where it's been!
It could be full of germs
Don't be so ridiculous
I seem to recognize this writing
It looks like yours, Mr. Brown
No, it's nothing like mine!
Itjust looks like mine
- Well I'd better open it
- I think I'll go
I haven't finished with you yet
You will have when you read that letter
- I beg you pardon?
- Nothing
Good Heavens
Miss Courtney
I've never read anything like it in my life
- I can explain...
- Just listen to this
I'd rather not
Dear Miss, I'm writing to tell you of my feelings for you
You see I thought I'd won...
Pardon?
I want to hold you in my arms and kiss you
You did write this letter Mr. Brown
Well I...
Not to you
It's the letter you wrote for that Hungarian student
- Yes, you see what must have happened
- You don't need to go on
Obviously he's been smitten by my charm and beauty
- Pardon?
- I have told you before Mr. Brown
I do have a strange fascination for the opposite sex
Oh yes very strange
You may not believe this, Mr. Brown
But when I was a young girl I was very plain
A cup of tea Gladys please
Everything ok, Mr. Brown?
Yes!
I must have put Zoltan's letter to his girl friend in my envelop to Miss Courtney
- He's not going to be very happy
- Why not?
He's gonna give the letter you write to Mrs. Courtney, to his girlfriend!
- Stand up and listen.
- Now, wait a minute.
Stop it!
Money and force.
Seems to be what you Ewings understand the best.
You're starting to sound like your knee-jerk radical brother.
If he doesn't do something the Ewing family will control everyone and everything.
There's bound to be a body in that closet someplace.
Find it.
Do you think I would deliberately betray you?
You live with vipers, you become a viper.
I don't know how to play by your rules, but someday I will and you're going to pay for what you've done to my brother.
Boys, we've got a problem.
That's why we called you here.
We've got to find somebody who can beat Cliff Barnes in this election.
- Any suggestions?
- Beau Kinney.
He's interested.
I think he can pull it off.
He just became head of the rifle club.
- No, not Kinney.
- What's the problem, J.R.?
Had a big alimony suit about three years ago, made all the papers.
Three years?
Hell, the public's memory's only three days long.
Yeah, but Cliff Barnes' memory's a lot longer.
Careful, Jordan.
You're talking about a relative of Bobby's.
Any other ideas?
You got anything for us, Wade?
Martin Cole.
Cole?
Who's that, J.R.?
- Fort Worth.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
City councilman in Fort Worth, moved here about two years ago.
He's a churchgoer, married to Senator Orloff's niece Nancy father of two daughters, has a good law practice.
He just came out against gun control, is as clean as they come.
- Even Barnes couldn't get anything on him.
- You think he'll cooperate?
What do you know about this guy Cole, Bobby?
Well, Daddy, he's dull, but he's clean and honest.
All right.
Anything else?
Any other suggestions?
Cole it is.
Bobby will handle the campaign funding, just like he did with Wild Bill Orloff.
He'll be your inside man.
Won't that cause some trouble at home?
I don't think it's gonna cause any trouble at home.
My wife is entitled to her opinion in this election.
- It is the American way, isn't it?
- Bobby can take care of his wife.
He knows where his first loyalty begins.
He's a Ewing, first and last.
He's with us all the way.
Mr. Barnes, the people I represent have been most impressed with your investigative work the way you handled that committee on corruption in the independent oil companies.
In fact, your stand against all corruption.
It's reassuring to know that at least I'm pleasing some of the people some of the time.
- Indeed.
And they'd like to show their appreciation and encourage your continued efforts.
- They have read my platform?
- Of course.
They've paid a great deal of attention to it.
I see.
And they're aware that there's a strong ecological plank in it and that if I'm elected, I'm going to do everything I can to stop wasteful oil drillings, no matter who's responsible.
They know you're a reasonable man and feel sure you'd put their small gift to good use.
I have a feeling this small gift would wipe out the national debt.
- Look for yourself.
- No, wait, wait.
No, just...
Just hold it a minute, Mr. Livingston.
See, I don't think you're getting my drift, so I wanna make it plain to you.
I've spent a lot of time lately fighting the small, independent oil companies but that doesn't mean that I'll hop in bed with the big guys.
- That is who you represent, right?
- Don't be foolish, Barnes.
They're prepared to make a generous contribution to your campaign generous enough to make a major difference.
They can afford to be generous because their profits are obscene.
Jock Ewing, at least he doesn't pose as a patron of the arts and humanities.
He's a barracuda and he doesn't pretend to be anything else.
Call me if you change your mind.
I can assure you there are no strings attached.
There are always strings.
And the invisible ones have a way of becoming visible at the most inconvenient times.
The response to the questionnaire seems to indicate a political alliance with the views of our candidate, Mr. Clifford Barnes.
- Hi there, Mrs. Ewing.
How you doing?
- Hi.
Fine, thank you.
- Peter Larson, I heard you were here.
- Pam!
- I got in over the weekend.
- It's good to see you again.
- I'm looking for that crazy brother of mine.
- He's right back here.
I am so excited about this.
I'm so glad you came out to help him.
Hey, what a nice surprise.
What, did you get tired of ringing doorbells?
Well, maybe I can find something creative for you to do.
- Like typing addresses on envelopes?
- Oh, I don't know.
We can talk about it over lunch.
You wanna join us?
I'd love to, but I've got phone calls to get through.
You see that?
You see how devoted he is?
Well, I wish everybody was like that.
I'm buying.
That was good, Cliff.
Any idea who the Ewings are backing?
No.
They're deciding that right now.
- Would you tell me if you knew?
- Of course I would.
Unless Bobby asked me not to.
Whoever it is, you can bet that they're not gonna spare any expense now in trying to get him elected.
Which brings me to a job that I have in mind for you.
I need money.
How do you suppose I'm gonna come up with that?
Well, I've come up with an idea that won't involve your dipping into your joint checking account.
- Well, what a wonderful relief.
- Yeah.
The manager of the Texas Club, he's offered me his hall for a benefit.
Now, the hospital association last year had a fashion show, raised $50,000.
Fifty thousand dollars I can use.
I can use half of that.
What do you want me to do, Cliff?
I want you to run a fashion show.
Well, aren't you just overjoyed at the prospect of helping me out.
Well it's mainly my job.
I just don't know if I have the kind of time...
Oh, come on, Pam!
What, you're getting flak from the Ewings because you're involved in my campaign?
Well, what do you think?
Of course I am.
You can't back out now because everybody knows that you're working for me.
And how would it look if my sister were to desert me?
That would be a great job for public relations.
I'm not deserting you, Cliff.
It's just, under the circumstances, I wanted to keep a low profile.
You can't keep a low profile in politics and especially when you're related to the candidate.
You're the only one I've got to count on.
I need the money.
And the Ewings and their crowd, they can buy this election.
And if I don't have money for TV time I don't stand a chance.
All right.
Oh, there's gonna be hell to pay.
- I knew I could count on you.
- Yeah, I bet you did.
Hey, listen, with your connections at the store...
I stopped by Sam Twohy's place this afternoon.
He doesn't like Cole very much, but he says he'll pay.
He'd better.
Pulled his fat out of the fire often enough.
Same goes for Crenshaw.
He's gonna ante up on his own.
Hey, good, good.
- Oh, hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
I'm sorry I'm late.
We couldn't get out of the office.
That's okay.
I just got home myself.
Oh, did you bring all your work home with you?
Well, it's not exactly work, Bobby.
It's for...
- What, Pam?
- How about a couple of drinks, J.R.?
- Just soda, Jock.
- Come on, Ellie.
Bobby.
My goodness, Pam, that looks like enough work for a week.
What's it about?
Well, I'm organizing a fundraising fashion show for Cliff's campaign.
A fashion show.
What a novel idea.
- When did all this come up, honey?
- Today.
I thought you said she's just stuffing envelopes.
Cliff is my brother and he asked me to do this and I would like to do whatever I can to help.
I'd also prefer to discuss this with Bobby in private.
Well, Bobby don't keep any secrets from his family.
Well, maybe he's not sure which family he belongs to.
That's enough, J.R.
Well, let's see who raises the most money for the candidates, Bobby or Pam.
Bobby's handling campaign funding, just like he did for Wild Bill Orloff.
Sorry.
My, I can see it's dinnertime.
- Not quite, Lucy.
- Thanks a lot, J.R.
Anybody want another drink?
I believe I do, Miss Ellie.
You just sit down.
I'll get it myself.
Pamela, I think it's time we talked about just what we're doing.
I have to do it, Bobby.
Cliff's my brother and I have to help him.
I knew it would be difficult when you were stuffing envelopes but this, I don't know.
Well, there's no one else to do it.
He doesn't have the kind of organization behind him that the Ewing candidate does.
Well, that's the problem, honey.
There is a Ewing candidate and you are a Ewing now.
Have you figured out how you'll handle that?
Yes.
I'm going to help my brother.
Pamela, do you understand what this election means to my family?
Oh, I understand exactly what it means to your family.
- It's a way to get back at my brother.
- You're being simplistic, you know it.
Your brother hasn't had a hands-off policy when it comes to us, has he?
Well, what do you expect him to do?
If he doesn't do something the Ewing family will control everyone and everything.
Stop it.
You're starting to sound like your knee-jerk radical brother.
If being a knee-jerk radical means being against exploitation corruption and greed, I'm proud to be one.
Exploitation and corruption of who, of what?
Look, my daddy built an empire here because he was smarter than the next guy, worked harder and was luckier.
But anybody with the same qualifications can do the same thing.
That's easy to say when you're born rich.
It's the others Cliff's worried about.
Cliff talks a great game, but when it comes down to it he can play as dirty as the rest of them.
Well, we see things differently, don't we?
What I see, Pamela, is what this is doing to us.
Well, we've chosen our sides.
No.
No, not this time.
This time, I think we were born into them.
Among the major problems facing us today is government interference in the lives of individuals and control of those lives through massive taxation.
I would like to remind you of the words of Jesus:
"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's."
And I'm sure if he were alive today, he would want to add:
"And let man keep what is rightfully his own."
I thank you.
We would like to thank both candidates, Mr. Barnes and Mr. Cole for coming this evening and presenting their views.
Before we have refreshments, we have time for a few questions.
I didn't know you were interested in politics.
Well, I'm not, but certain politicians interest me a lot.
I'm glad to hear that.
When I found out you would be here this evening I couldn't resist volunteering to chair the meeting.
I'm flattered.
And surprised.
Why surprised?
I thought Martin Cole would be more appealing.
Politically, that is.
Martin Cole has limited appeal to me.
Politically or otherwise.
I hate to interrupt, but your conversation is arousing more interest than gun control and the ERA put together.
It certainly was an interesting debate, Mr. Barnes.
- I'm sure it'll be a close race.
- It won't be close at all because I intend to beat the pants off my worthy opponent.
Excuse me.
Is it J.R. Ewing you're out to get or his wife?
I hadn't really thought about that.
Till now.
We have got to do something and we got to do it fast.
Barnes gets stronger every day.
We keep pumping money into your campaign fund and we're getting nothing in return.
- We're doing everything we can.
I know that, I know you are, but it's just not enough.
The polls show that Barnes is gaining one percentage point every day.
- We can't live with that.
- That's no surprise.
It's a recognition factor.
Things will change in time.
Take my word for it.
- It just takes time.
- We don't have time.
Things will improve.
My wife says down at the church that we're...
First thing you've got to do is hire a speechwriter with some guts.
The guy you've got now puts everybody to sleep.
And stop dressing in those tired old man's clothes.
- J.R.
- Yes?
Take this man shopping tomorrow.
Get him some new clothes.
- That won't be necessary.
- We'll tell you what's necessary.
We are paying for your election.
And buy more television time.
I want to see your face every time I turn that damn thing on.
Barnes brought a fellow out from Madison Avenue to manage his media campaign.
Yeah?
Who's that, J.R.?
Peter Larson.
Ran Bryan's campaign in New York.
- Is he any good?
- Yes, sir, he is.
- Can we get him?
- I doubt it.
All right, let's get somebody else.
Done.
I really appreciate you dropping by.
Why don't I pick you up 10:00 tomorrow morning.
We're gonna make you look like a state senator yet.
- Whatever you say, J.R.
- Good boy.
Nice seeing you.
Well...
Man...
- He's a washout.
- Yes, sir.
- You know he can't win.
- Yes, sir, I know that.
We've got to see to it that Barnes loses.
Dig something up on him.
I've tried everything.
I've got the boys working on it.
He's clean.
There must be something wrong with the man.
Nobody's gotten that far in politics and stayed clean.
He's just been careful, that's all.
And don't forget he's a Barnes.
There's bound to be a body in that closet someplace.
Find it.
All right, sir.
If I can't find it, I'll put it there.
Whatever.
Whatever.
Inherited $27 million.
Her husband had a franchise for all the mechanical things made in Mexico.
You know, tractors and heavy-duty graders, things like that.
I didn't know that.
Miss Ellie, I don't think the turkey's to Pamela's liking.
She hasn't even touched her dinner.
The turkey's fine, Miss Ellie.
I'm just not very hungry.
Thank you.
Maybe you're working too hard.
Careful you don't get sick.
We wouldn't want your brother to lose his chief fundraiser.
That reminds me, J.R.
That new ad agency I hired for Martin wants their money in advance.
They were burned on the last campaign by a few boys.
They'll get it.
They're worth every penny of it.
Martin's beginning to come over as a real statesman.
- Well, good.
- Not an easy task, I might add.
Did you get him a new speechwriter?
He sounded better the last time I heard him.
Had to.
Gotta fight fire with fire, Miss Ellie.
Barnes brought that Larson fellow out of New York to run his campaign.
He's called a media...
What the hell is it, Bobby?
- Media specialist, Dad.
- Yeah, that's it.
Media specialist.
For a man who's always crying poverty, that seems a little extravagant to me.
Peter and Cliff were roommates in college.
Peter's volunteering his services.
Now, isn't that unusual?
Above and beyond the call of ordinary friendship?
Meaning what?
I was just interested in the nature of the friendship.
Seems extremely close.
Growing phenomenon nowadays.
Something I can't understand myself.
You mean to tell me that that gorgeous Cliff Barnes is...
I don't like the tone of this conversation.
I know I don't.
I just think it's strange.
Man past 30, never been married.
It just so happens Cliff was engaged to be married to a girl in New York who worked for Peter's father.
- He's just never gotten over her.
- He was?
What happened?
Why didn't he get married?
Well, she...
She died.
How awful.
How'd she die?
It was an accident.
I don't remember much about it.
Well, that was a fine dinner, Miss Ellie.
I think I'll work it off in front of the TV.
Cowboys are playing tonight.
- Want to join me?
- In a minute.
I'll bring in your coffee.
Why don't you make it bourbon.
- I wanna see you, J.R.
- Yes, sir.
Mama, excuse me.
I know.
I know it's short notice, Dan, but we gotta move quick on this.
Now, you call me back just as soon as you can.
Okay.
Who'd we get?
Dan Marsh, private investigator.
He'll be in New York City tomorrow morning.
Well, if Cliff Barnes has a body buried somewhere, he'll find it.
- When will we know?
- Couple of days.
Good, good.
You're gonna have to talk to me.
We're still married to each other.
Yeah, but we're on opposite sides of the fence.
How'd she die?
I don't remember.
Remember?
You were never very good at lying.
The tips of your ears turn red.
I can't tell you, Bobby.
I'm sorry.
Honey, if you feel you can't trust me, well that says something about the state of our marriage.
Come on.
Just give me a little time, okay?
Okay, Dan.
That is wonderful.
That's the sort of thing we're looking for.
Hang on just a second, would you?
Louella, get ahold of my daddy at the ranch.
Say, did you get a statement from the doctor?
I see.
All right.
We'll release the story anyway.
I sure appreciate this, bud.
I'll have a check in the mail to you this afternoon.
Okay.
- Yeah?
- Mr. Ewing on line one.
Thank you, darling.
Hello, Daddy.
We hit pay dirt.
Yeah.
Barnes just broke the cardinal rule of politics:
Never get caught in bed with a live man or a dead woman.
When Pamela says, "This is Charlene," come down the ramp quickly.
That's lovely.
Do a nice turn right over there.
Follow me down to the center.
That's good.
Yes, yes.
Come over here, make another turn, take off that jacket.
Throw it over your left shoulder.
Go to that end of the ramp.
Lovely.
All right, darling, Tiffany.
Yes, come on.
Lovely.
Quickly.
Let me show Cliff, okay?
I'll let you know.
I love them.
Show that wonderful shirt.
That's lovely.
Yes.
Hello!
Where you are now, make a nice turn.
Well, that's a really nice lineup.
I am so pleased.
They're all very good too.
This is Kristin Carlson.
I'm standing in the main dining hall of the Texas Club where a benefit is being held later this week for Clifford Barnes, candidate for state senate.
Barnes, this reporter has just learned, has been implicated in the abortion death of a young woman who was his fiancée about 10 years ago.
Mr. Barnes, most women's groups favor abortion on demand.
Given the circumstances of her death where do you stand on the issue?
- He has no comment.
Will this hurt your chances for victory in the election?
Sorry.
Nothing right now.
Your opponent, Martin Cole, has taken a strong stand against abortion.
- Our radio audience would welcome...
- I said, no comment!
It's okay, I'll...
I'll have a statement for the press later this evening.
I don't have anything to say right now.
Folks, just come with me.
I'll call you as soon as Mr. Barnes is ready to hold a press conference.
Cliff, Cliff...
Wait a minute.
No, I don't want to talk right now.
I've gotta salvage a sinking ship.
It's important.
I've got to tell you something.
No, really.
No, really.
I can't talk to you.
Which way did Peter...?
Peter!
Okay, folks.
I am sure that you've all heard by now but I just wanted you to hear my side of the story.
First of all, it's true.
Penny Ames and I lived together for several months before she became pregnant.
Peter knew her.
She was his father's secretary.
And Penny's dream was to enter law school.
Saved every nickel toward her tuition.
She had just passed her entrance exams and found out that she was pregnant.
I wanted to marry her, but she said that we weren't ready for a child.
So I borrowed money and went to a doctor who had been recommended to us.
And you know the rest.
Mr. Barnes, why didn't you get her to a hospital?
Because abortions were illegal at the time and you couldn't just go to a hospital and have it taken care of properly.
I know, but why did you keep it a secret?
I mean, you should've known that someone would find out.
The secrecy was out of deference to Penny's family.
They were very religious and they wanted it kept quiet.
How is this going to affect the campaign?
Well, it's too early to tell.
See, what Cole is saying is that I was involved in an illegal activity that contributed to Penny's death.
Well, insofar as abortions were illegal at the time, he's right.
- I can't deny that.
- What do I tell everybody when they call?
The phones haven't stopped ringing.
Well, you can tell them that I'll have a statement for them this evening.
Or...
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You could tell them the truth.
You could tell them exactly what I've told you because I loved Penny and I wanted to do what she wanted to do and it just didn't work out.
That's it.
I don't know how they got ahold of that.
That's what I don't understand.
Penny's family, I know they wouldn't say anything.
And the only other people that knew were you and Pam.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not you.
And Pam's out of the question.
The doctor must've gotten in touch with the Ewings somehow.
Why would he do that?
He's just out on parole.
He can't want that kind of publicity, no matter how much money's involved.
Why don't you get out of here.
I can handle the phones.
Hi.
I probably shouldn't have come, but it was an impulse.
I heard the news on the radio.
I'm surprised you didn't hear it firsthand from J.R.
I don't hear much first or secondhand from J.R.
Yeah?
Well, I guess he's pretty busy.
I imagine he's trying to dig up whatever he can to destroy me.
I've just been wondering how he found out.
You know, don't you?
I'd hate to be around when you find out.
I'm really sorry.
You know what?
I really believe you are.
So am I.
Oh, boy, about a lot of things.
Well bye.
Yeah, well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
That's wonderful.
All right.
Well, Dad, Martin is finally beginning to gain in the polls.
Well, we've got Dan to thank for that.
Not to mention my pretty sister-in-law.
How could you have done it?
!
And you, you let him!
Politics is politics.
And that's your excuse?
For taking a fine, good man and destroying him?
And you, you don't need an excuse.
You'd do it for your own self-serving entertainment!
Now, now, hold on, Pamela.
We understand that you love your brother but you do have a slightly prejudiced view of him.
And despite what you consider his sterling qualifications the man apparently doesn't hesitate to do what's illegal whenever it suits him.
You have distorted this entire issue.
I think you're despicable!
We just told the truth, that's all.
I'll tell you something:
I don't know how to play by your rules, but someday I will and you're going to pay for what you've done to my brother.
No, you won't.
You won't use any of those rules against me or any other Ewing.
You'll do just as we do.
You'll use them to protect your own interests.
Then God help me.
Hi.
I called Peter at the office.
He said you'd probably be here.
- You look tired.
- No, I'm doing pretty good considering the beating I'm taking.
When I think what this might mean to your career, Cliff, it...
It just seems so unfair.
Oh, come on, you have to look at the bright side.
Just think, my losing might be saving your marriage.
- Who told you that?
- What?
That the Ewings don't like you working for me?
Cliff, I have to tell you something and it's so hard.
I don't even know how to do it.
Well, why don't you just tell me.
I don't even understand how I did it.
I was talking and it just slipped out.
And...
It was you?
Before I could do anything about it, J.R. was off and running.
Cliff, if there was any way...
You know, I never even suspected you.
For a moment, I thought maybe it might be Peter.
But you?
You never even crossed my mind.
Oh, Cliff, I know it's unforgivable, but it was an accident.
Come off it, Pam!
- Things like that just don't slip out.
- What?
You're not a child!
You had to know what you were doing.
You don't think I did it on purpose and...
I think you'd do anything for Bobby Ewing.
- That's what I think.
- How dare you!
Just don't lie to me, Pam.
What you're saying is unforgivable!
I mean, do you think I would deliberately betray you?
No, no, no, no, no.
What you did is unforgivable.
You can at least listen to me.
You can give me a chance to...
Why should I listen to you?
!
The Ewings destroy everything they get their hands on and you're one of them now.
You live with vipers, you become a viper.
So why don't you go back to where you belong.
To them.
I heard the news on the radio.
What happened?
We were rehearsing at the Texas Club.
The reporters just busted in.
- How did he take it?
- How do you think?
He was in shock the whole time.
We make quite a pair.
J.R. and me.
Between the two of us, we managed to ruin a pretty terrific guy.
No, honey, it wasn't you.
And it wasn't J.R.
Cliff made a mistake, J.R. just exposed it.
- You're defending J.R.'s tactics?
- No, I am pointing out a political reality.
Not every politician goes right for the jugular.
Well, honey, I haven't noticed that Cliff runs from the smell of blood himself.
Sweetheart, you cannot change the rules according to whose side you're on.
Now, Cliff made a mistake.
J.R. found out about it.
I know you feel bad, but honey, that is the name of the game.
You sound just like your father.
I didn't come home to fight with you.
I heard the report on the news.
You must be feeling bad.
I love you, remember?
Cliff thinks I deliberately told J.R.
I'm sorry, honey.
What's the matter?
I wanted to take a real good look and see if it was worth marrying into the Ewing family.
Honey, this hasn't been Cliff's best day.
He'll come around.
He knows you wouldn't say something like that on purpose.
I don't know.
He's really hurt.
It'll be okay.
All right, Daddy, smile.
Come on, we got some more people coming in.
Hey, Ma!
We got good news!
How you doing?
Take this.
There's more.
Hey, catch the door, would you?
Hey, Dad, look who's here!
Look who's here!
Well, isn't that something?
Just hold it down a little bit.
I'm gonna turn up the volume.
Results are coming in from the 14th district which is the heart of Barnes ' territory.
With 15 percent of the votes counted, it looks like another Cole victory.
Did you hear that?
15!
We're on top!
Hey, how about that?
Let's buy a drink for everybody in the house.
This has been a stunning come-from-behind upset for Martin Cole the former city councilman from Fort Worth.
Mr. Cole, as you know, married to the former Nancy Orloff daughter of Senator Orloff.
- This must be a very special victory...
- May I join you?
Not if you're going to gloat.
I'm not gonna gloat.
I'm just sorry that the best man lost.
I'm not sure I heard that.
I was just thinking how nice it would have been if J.R. didn't get what he wanted for once.
- They tell me that it's over.
- Oh, come on, don 't give up.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I wanna say that you're the best group of people I've ever worked with.
I want you to go home, get acquainted with your families again and I'll see you next time around.
Excuse me, Pamela.
We got 10 key spots sewed up.
Couple more, we'll be running the whole show.
What do you think about that?
Got other ideas?
Well, not right now, Wade but we won't forget the work you did in the 14th district.
I'll be right back.
Did you call him?
A little while ago.
What did he say?
Same thing as before.
What did you offer me to do him in?
- He can't be serious, honey.
- Oh, he is.
Come on.
Let's go see Cliff.
Oh, Bobby, I don't think now's the time for a confrontation.
Now is the perfect time to straighten things out between the two of you.
Don't you think I could have one shot of bourbon after this great victory?
- I'm sick and tired of this soda water.
- No, Jock.
Would you get Mr. Ewing some soda water, please?
Put a lot of ice in it.
Here at the Cole campaign headquarters we're getting ready for the acceptance speech.
And here comes Martin Cole now.
Listen to that crowd.
Let's call it a day.
Go ahead.
I've got some things to sort out.
Do it tomorrow.
I'm leaving for New York in the morning.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I'll catch you next time.
Come on.
You're not the first guy who lost.
True.
You know, I don't like the feeling.
I'll help you win next time.
You're on.
And I'll be in the bar across the street if you change your mind.
Thanks, Peter.
- Is Cliff here?
- Cliff's in his office.
Oh, Peter, this is my husband, Bobby Ewing.
- How do you do?
- Pam I'm not sure this is a good time.
Better wait a few days.
No, we'll see him now, thank you.
Good luck.
Come on, honey.
I wanna talk to you.
Well, how are you at one-way conversations?
Because I'm not in the mood to talk.
Look, I think you two ought to straighten this whole mess out.
Oh, what mess?
You got your election.
I mean, you don't expect me to be happy and forgiving about the way you got it.
Which means you'll go on blaming Pam forever for something that was an accident?
An accident?
Don't make me laugh.
You put her up to it.
Bobby had nothing to do with it, Cliff.
- Come on, give her a chance to explain.
- A chance to lie.
- Just stand up and listen.
- Now, wait a minute.
Stop it!
Money and force.
Seems to be what you Ewings understand the best.
Cliff, I swear to you, I never told them about Penny's death.
I did tell them you were engaged and that your fiancée died.
But you've got to believe me, I didn't tell them anything else.
J.R. found out the rest for himself.
I'd never do anything to hurt you.
You know, sometimes I think your hatred of us Ewings is like a cancer inside of you that chews up your good sense.
Don't you know I love you?
I love you too.
I'm so sorry.
I know I messed up everything.
Forgive me.
It seems like we've both got a little forgiving to do.
And I'm willing.
What do you say we go over to the bar and have a drink?
Yeah, I...
Not right now, thanks.
I...
I've just got some thinking I've got to do.
I appreciate your coming down.
I know that must've been tough.
- See you soon?
- Okay.
- Buy you lunch.
- Sure.
Come on, honey.
Peter Larson, please.
He's at the bar.
Well, I'm glad it's all over.
If I know my brother, it's just beginning.
Peter?
Cliff.
I want you to get ahold of Livingston.
Yep, the guy with the cashier's check.
Ask him if he's got enough money to buy the next state senate seat.
Maybe even the Congress.
Peter I've just become a realist.

We'd better come up with some genius of our own.
(man) I believe, General, you've already met my assistant, Dr. Corday.
I'd like to introduce some members of our team.
Dr. Robeson of Caltech, who's our expert on fossil fuel.
Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins.
Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett, who heads Thermal.
Huh.
Dr. Norman Link, who's been doing some intriguing work in garbage research.
- So what?
- Dr. Link.
Just a second, Dr. Heffel. I have to relay some vital information to a colleague.
Oh, yes.
This is our hard-water man, Dr. Leach.
Right, Ernie.
The Lakers by a point and a half for 1 00 bucks.
When will you have the line on Philly and the New York Knicks?
(Heffel) I'd like you to meet Mr. Jurist, who also is involved in Thermal.
And there's Dr. Banford, Professor Epstein, Doctors Davidson and Barrett.
And, of course, this is Dr. Humphrey, our head of Nuclear.
Mr. Stallwood, our head of Procurement and Supplies.
What are you doing here?
When the call went out for an emergency meeting, I naturally assumed...
You assumed wrong.
Scientists.
Double-A clearance only.
Out.
- But I might have a contribution.
- lf we need any pencils, I'll send for you.
- But, Dr. Heffel...
- Out.
Sorry, General.
Where was I?
Oh, yes.
Professor...
Dr. Heffel, I didn't come for a roll call, I came to pick brains.
Are they all here?
- Yes.
These are our top people.
- Then let's get to it!
I understand, General.
Attention, everyone.
(Heffel) Dr. Link.
That's it, Professor.
I'll call tomorrow with more input.
Bye.
All right, Sergeant.
Open it.
Drapes.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is top secret.
The United States government will countenance no leaks.
Now.
What's holding it up?
- Nothing.
- It's amazing.
- Where did you get it?
- What is it?
(man) A propulsion unit of some sort, ladies and gentlemen.
Never mind where we got it.
We have other experts working on that.
What we want to know from you is, what makes it tick?
OK.
Let's have your hypothesis.
Uh, the energy source could be atomic.
We've checked on that.
Negative.
Direct conversion, utilizing thermionic...
- Checked out.
Negative.
- Oh.
It's not propelled by garbage, I know that.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Come in, Olympus.
Mr. Olympus?
This is Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something very big and very...
Jellyfish.
Your man in ERL?
Yes, sir.
That Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something.
No, sir. I think you'll find this a great deal more interesting than my last report.
Right now, Dr. Heffel is in a secret meeting with a four-star general and a whole gaggle of scientists.
What are they meeting about?
I don't know, sir, it's a secret.
Get in there and find out?
Do any of you have a solid evaluation?
Not a guess, a solid premise?
Do you?
Well?
(clears throat)
Do you think it might be fruitful to bring Dr. Wilson into this discussion, Dr. Heffel?
- Wilson?
- Yes.
He might very well come up with an applicable theory.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Who's Dr. Wilson?
- He's in my carpool.
Oh...
That is, we live in the same building.
- That certainly qualifies him.
- Oh.
No.
What I'm trying to say is, he's a very bright young physicist who's come here recently on loan from Caltech.
A loan, I might add, that is bearing absolutely no interest.
(laughter)
He's a little unorthodox, but a brilliant theorist.
- General Stilton isn't interested in...
- Get him.
- What?
- Get him.
His output couldn't be any less than what we've gotten so far.
Yes, General.
He really has an unusual mind.
- Well, Dr. Wilson?
- It's beautiful.
Don't you have any other observation?
- Only that it looks like an artichoke.
- We know it looks like an artichoke.
What makes it tick?
Mayonnaise?
Negative.
No, I was only joking, sir.
I do have a theory, sir, actually, in line with the work I've been doing.
I have a hunch it's tapping the primal mainstream.
The primal mainstream?
It's everywhere, only on different frequencies.
The whole electromagnetic spectrum -
Cosmic, gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, radio waves.
Do you know how much we finite human beings can tune into with our senses?
Less than five percent.
The universe makes its own energy.
We even make it ourselves.
Yes, take biofeedback, for instance.
If I taped terminals to your head, General, your brain could run an electric train.
- Electric train?
- (Heffel) I'm sorry, General.
Perhaps electric train wasn't the most apt example.
(Heffel) Thank you very much.
- Let me have that for a couple of months...
- Thank you.
A couple of months?
Dr. Heffel?
- Yes, General?
- l want action.

You know, Drexel, I've seen the most amazing thing.
Amazing.

(bell rings)
Thank you, Drexel.
Well.
How did you get in here?
Huh?
Now look, you're asking for trouble.
Dr. Heffel isn't too crazy about animals in the building.
Fact is, he isn't too crazy about people in the building either.
What's your name, huh?
Charlie?
Cuddles?
Jake?
Yes, yes.
You look like Jake.
That, Jake, is the Van Allen belt.
Oil and coal is not going to do it, you know.
And, one of these days, that sun of ours is going to turn into a big black hole.
You know where it's really at, Jake?
Electromagnetism.
We're loaded with it.
You know, it's crazy, but you almost look like you know what I'm talking about.
All right, give me a hand with this, Sergeant.
Easy, easy.
That's it.
Stallwood, administration emergency!
That's some fancy collar you got there.
Maybe I'll take you home with me.
My neighbor Liz has a cat named Lucybelle.
She's really cute.
And the cat's not bad either.
Liz!
Hi.
Ouch!
I've...
- We were just talking about you.
- Were you?
This is Jake.
I'm going to take him home with us.
You won't have to drive Professor Link and myself home tonight.
- Heffel's called a late meeting.
- l can wait.
That won't be necessary.
- How about a coffee?
- No.
- Chocolate chip cookie?
- No.
- Are you sore or something?
- Sore?
Sore?
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- What is it?
What did I do?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Mayonnaise?
Electric trains?
Well, now, look, really, all that...
that was just a joke, Doctor.
Well, nobody laughed, especially the general.
Has he had water?
- The general?
- The cat.
Oh.
Water?
Cats do get thirsty, you know.
Do you have a bowl?
A bowl?
Right here, yes.
Here.
- Water?
- Yes, right, water.
Look, Liz...
Dr. Bartlett.
Just because some general lacks a sense of humor, that's no reason...
- All I was trying to convey...
- I'm really not interested, Doctor.
Besides, I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's just that the magnitude of what the general showed us just bowled me over.
- it did?
- Oh, completely.
- Black.
- What?
- Didn't you offer me a cup of coffee?
- Right.
Check.
Coming right up.
I really don't understand, that's all.
The man who wrote the article you did for The Scientific Quarterly...
- You read it?
- Well, of course. it was brilliant.
I've been wanting to tell you.
We don't get much chance to talk in the car pool, but I've been following your work.
- You have?
- Closely.
It's very impressive, very innovative, very attractive.
I mean, it's bound to attract attention.
Oh, well, um, I am writing an article at the moment and I would love to have your criticism.
Oh.
Maybe at lunch or, even better, at dinner sometime?
- Yeah, I'd like that.
When?
- Tonight?
No, that's right, you've got that late meeting.
That may not go all that late.
I should be out by seven.
Is that too late?
- Seven's beautiful.
- Good.
Well...
Oh, thanks for the coffee.
it was delicious.
- l think she digs you.
- l sure hope so.
- Who said that?
- l did.
Frank, we'd better get down to business.
Sit down.
We've gotta talk.
I'm running out of time, and you're the only one I can depend on to help me.
- It's you?
- It's not the mouse.
Now, sit down.
But your lips aren't moving.
You're not speaking.
Thought transference.
Nothing exceptional where l come from.
Now, sit.
My name is Zunar J5/9 Doric 4-7.
Zunar...?
Why don't we just stay with Jake, OK?
Frank, last night at 03 hours plus 1 3, I made an emergency landing in a spaceship from another galaxy.
That so-called artichoke... it's from my craft.
But... you're a cat.
Granted.
But you see, in our civilization, that's as far as we needed to evolve.
We developed our brain to a fine point.
Now, man rose off his four legs and developed tools, machinery, agriculture and a chronic pain in his lower back.
We developed tools for the mind.
This collar here, it amplifies brain power.
- it does what?
- Well, it provides energy by which we...
Look, let me give you a demonstration.
(cello music)
- (flute plays)
- Not a bad little tune.
(humming along)
Mm-mmm.
Frank, this is really delicious.
What is it?
Oh, it's chopped kidney.
It's all they had at the deli.
it really hits the spot.
I'm gonna take a couple of cases for my trip back.
Sure beats the blah I've been eating.
Well, now back to my problem.
Frank, I need an answer.
- What do you say?
- Say about what?
Can I count on you to help me repair my spaceship?
- Why me?
- Because I like the way you think.
Your equations rather interest me.
In fact, they're really not bad at all... for a human.
- Really?
I'm on the right track?
- Quite definitely, but years away from a solution.
Frank, on my planet, we have an expression - you rub my fur, I'll rub yours.
How would you like to make a quantum jump?
You help me, and I'll give you a push in the right direction.
- You're serious?
- I'm serious.
- You really are from outer space?
- l am from outer space.
- Even though you're a cat?
- Frank!
Is it a deal?
It's a deal.
Oh, that's...
We better move.
I've got to make repairs to my ship by 5:1 3 Sunday for liftoff, or I'll miss the rendezvous with the mother ship.
Right.
I'll get my sweater.
Uh, do you think that you can find your way back to that airport?
No problem.
I made a memory imprint.
- With the collar?
- Right.
Fantastic.
How developed does your brain have to be to use that collar?
Not very.
In fact, you could handle it.
You wanna try?
Do we have time?
Why not?
Look, just grab hold of it.
Easy.
Don't take it off.
Without it, I'm just an average cat.
Right.
- Right.
OK?
- OK.
- Now just concentrate.
- Concentrate.
Think levitation.
Levitation.
You're as light as a feather.
Look at me.
I'm floating!
It's just plain incredible!
- Look, one hand.
- You're losing your concentration.
Yeah.
Hi, Frank.
Gotta use your set.
(commentator) The ball goes crosscourt to Brown.
He brings it...
- What were you doing up in the air?
- Uh...
- Astronaut exercises.
- Oh.
- Link, I'm busy.
- Yeah.
Well, just forget I'm here.
The last minute of the game, and Francine throws me out of the apartment.
Why does she throw me out?
For one lousy cigar burn on the chair.
- When did you get a cat?
- Jake's not my cat.
He's just visiting.
- Hi, Jake.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Do you mind, Frank?
Remember. the score's tied at 1 08.
Atlanta has the ball and a basket could win it.
Win it?
Oh, man!
And I gave a point and a half.
There goes my 1 00 bucks.
Come on, defense.
Come on, guys.
Man to man, we'll...
The crowd is really on its feet now.
The guy in the corner.
He's alone and closely guarded by King.
King steals the ball.
What a play.
Here come the Lakers.
Five seconds left.
Puts up a shot.
But a prayer. there's no chance.
Wait...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
I don't believe it.
He scores!
He made it in the last second.
and the Lakers will win it by two.
Unbelievable!
Frank, did you see that?
Yeah.
I'm really gonna have to ask you to leave.
- l could use another beer.
- I'm out of beer, I'm sorry.
- How about a ginger ale?
- I'm out of that, too.
- Could I at least finish my cigar?
- Link, please.
I'd like to have a little celebration.
I'll see you later.
The basketball game?
You did that?
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
it was the fastest way to get rid of that flake.
Let's go.
It's less than 36 hours to liftoff.
Right.
Oh...
Do you think I ought to carry you, so people don't suspect you're not an ordinary cat?
Good thinking, Frank.
Besides, my left paw's been acting up again.
- An old football injury?
- Actually, no.
Polo.
Now let's go.
What about getting into Hopscotch?
It'll be guarded.
- I'll handle that, too.
- It's fantastic.
Hi.
Hi, this is Lucybelle.
What'd you say you call him?
- Jake.
- Jake, right.
Jake, this is Lucybelle. I thought they could get acquainted while we're at dinner.
- At dinner?
- Yeah.
it was tonight, wasn't it?
Right.
Right, yes.
I was just about to call you.
Something came up.
I'm afraid you're going to have to give me a rain check.
Oh.
Oh, well, of course.
it really doesn't matter.
But it does.
it matters a lot, Liz.
Dr. Bartlett.
You see, what happened was... (Jake sneezing)
It's Jake.
He took sick.
Suddenly.
Out of the blue.
Really?
What is it?
I think it's, uh, Tasmanian Croup.
(sneezing)
You poor thing.
You know, he sounds terrible.
You'd better not let her get too close.
Stop milking it.
- What?
- l said I was about to rush him to the vet's.
The vet.
That's a good idea, Frank.
D'you know there's a very good vet who lives in the building?
A Dr. Wenger.
He specializes in cats.
I'm sure he'd be glad to take a look at him.
Jake prefers a general practitioner.
I'm sorry about dinner.
I'll make it up to you.
- How about a picnic?
- Tomorrow?
- You handled that very well.
- l didn't enjoy lying to Liz.
She's a very unusual person.
- Her kitty-cat's not too bad either.
- There's plenty of time for that.
That's all right for you to say.
But I've been confined to a spaceship for five months.
Ohh... (vehicle approaches)
- (Jake) The ship's in that big hangar.
- Oh.
There's got to be a way in.
- It's locked.
- No problem.
- Come on, come on.
- Right, right.
The coast is clear.
Let's go!
There she is.
Somebody's coming.
- Somebody's coming, Frank!
- l know, I know.
What's happening?
It's all clear.
- Let's go!
- It's this way.
(dog growls)
(barks)
Forget it. it wears off in 20 minutes.
He won't remember a thing.
Come on, let's go.
Incredible.
An older model, but in pretty good shape for a rig with nearly a trillion miles on it.
Now let's see about getting it operational again.
We've only got 34 hours left.
Right.
Through here?
Hm-hm.
Put me down.
Oh, it's just incredible.
The artichoke.
I was right.
- What's this... control panel?
- Uh-huh.
Sort of.
- And this?
- Uh, computer.
- Then this must be the readout.
- Frank, later.
I'll explain it all later, I promise.
- First, disengage the transducer system.
- How?
Take that neo-mag intercog, and you'll find the transducer switch on top of the ship.
Just coordinate with me.
Well, how do I get up there?
- Fly.
- Fly?
You mean use your collar?
Don't be ridiculous.
We carry a spare.
Concentrate, and when you get on top, engage the switch with the intercog and thought-project "seven max triad."
- Seven max triad.
- Right.
The computer will do the rest.
Seven max triad.
Right.
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hey, Frank, what are you doing up there?
What about the intercog?
Frank?
Jake, I'm ready to plug it in.
Right.
Go ahead.
- It's in.
- OK.
Thought-project.
Seven max triad.
OK, Frank.
Come on down.
Amazing.
I was afraid of that.
The focal terminal on the microtransformer's vaporized.
- You're sure?
- Positive.
But I'll double-check.
- Just what I thought.
- That's where the focal terminal goes?
Acts as a catalyzer.
I'll need a small amount of org 1 2.
- What's org 1 2?
- What the focal terminal's made of.
About six cubits ought to be enough.
You don't have org 1 2 on this planet?
Never heard of it.
Is it like mayonnaise?
You probably call it by a different name.
Stand back.
I'll run it through the computer.
(horn honks)
Hey, Tom!
You all right?
Tom!
Org 1 2...
ductile yellow metallic element.
Melting point - 1.063.
Tensile strength - 1 9.000.
- Tensile strength what?
- 1 9.000.
Atomic weight - 1 96.967.
Wait a minute.
That's the atomic weight of gold.
Wow!
(alarm blaring. bell ringing)
(soldier) Out!
Out!
Everybody out!
What is that?
Come on, let's go.
Follow me!
Holy cow.
- Give my collar room.
- You can't zap the whole base.
Let's get out of here.
Over here!
Follow me!
Move out!
Watch it!
Come back here!
(Jake) Where are you going?
Come out of there.
You're under arrest!
Look out!
- (meowing)
- What is it?
Get it off of me!
Get it off!
(soldier) Was anybody in there?
Back it out.
Look out.
Who's driving?
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!
- Yes, sir?
- Who sounded that alarm?
I did, sir.
We have an intruder, and his cat.
Cat?
Cat?
Cat?
Yes, sir.
Here's his collar.
Jake!
Excuse me.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Frank, shut up and move this thing.
- That's him, sir!
- Halt!
Get that thing out of here!
Get it out!
Move it out!
Whoa!
- Now what do we do?
- Now you hang on.
(Frank) 1 7 times...
Um, five of...
Now cosine of...
Yeah.
Uh...
This is even better than the stuff I had last night.
What's it called?
- Tuna.
- Tuna?
Love it.
- it doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?
According to your figures, we're going to need $1 20,000 worth of gold.
- So?
- So?
Jake, forgetting the money, which I can't forget, you know how much gold that is?
It's that much.
And you want to put it in a space that big?
You folks are still operating on the bulk system.
I'll reduce it to the size I need and still retain all its properties.
- How?
- I'll get into that later.
First buy the gold.
Buy it?
Jake, in order to buy $1 20,000's worth of gold, you need $1 20,000.
- So?
Is that a problem?
- A prob...?
My entire capital is tied up in my next paycheck.
- Then what's the alternative?
- l don't know what...
Hi.
- Traditionally known in horse racing...
- Oh, boy.
- What are you doing?
- Borrowing your TV.
Just bring me a beer and forget I'm here.
Hi, Jake.
Link...
Wife's worked out an equitable TV schedule.
The Peachtree Derby and the football game's on your set, and the opera on mine.
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Doing what... playing with your pussycat?
- Link...
- Franklin, please.
I've got a bundle bet on the Peachtree.
(softly) We've got problems to solve, things to do.
What?
- Link, I'm gonna have to ask you...
- Sshh!
They're at the post.
You want a peanut?
No.
- Come on, Sweet Jake.
Let's go.
- Sweet Jake?
Yeah.
It's a hunch bet.
1 00 on the nose at 1 5 to 1 .
I tell you, if she comes in, tiger, and I'm gonna be 1 500 in front, and you'll be licking mackerel fillet.
Did you forget my beer or did I drink it already?
Never mind, I'll get it.
- I'll try to get rid of him.
- (softly) Wait a minute.
Did you hear what he said?
If Sweet Jake finishes first, he wins $1 500.
- So?
- So if Link can win $1 500, why can't we win 1 20,000?
No.
Wait a minute.
He just made a bet.
He could win 1 500. it doesn't mean he will.
With me on his side, he will.
- Did you say something?
- Hmm?
No, nothing.
OK, OK.
Let's pipe down.
I got 1 00 big ones riding on this nag.
And they're off.
It's Denny's Doll breaking on top.
Attaboy Star.
Daddy's Poppa on the outside.
- Booky Baby on the rail and...
- Where's Sweet Jake?
Sweet Jake is still in the gate.
At the clubhouse turn. it's Denny's Doll by half a length.
Attaboy Star.
Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate.
Sweet Jake is moving.
He's way behind. but he's moving.
Uh-oh.
I think he stopped to have lunch.
I don't believe this.
Eat on your own time!
See what I mean?
Sweet Jake!
I should have bet on the Metropolitan Opera.
It's Attaboy Star by a length.
Booky Baby.
Denny's Doll and Seabottom.
Sweet Jake's finished eating and started running.
And. ladies and gentlemen. is he running.
But not even Silky Sullivan could come from this far behind.
It's Booky Baby taking the lead.
Daddy's Poppa moving into second.
Attaboy Star.
And making up incredible ground is Sweet Jake.
I have never seen anything like this.
But can he catch the pack?
At the top of the stretch. it's Booky Baby in the lead.
Daddy's Poppa.
And turning for home. it's Sweet Jake.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Give him the whip, dummy.
Attaboy.
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Jake.
Attaway.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Come on, boy!
That's it!
Hot dog!
We got it!
Yahoo!
Yeeha!
The story here today.
ladies and gentlemen. is Sweet Jake.
1500 smackeroos!
That calls for another beer.
- How about you?
I'm buying.
- No, thanks.
Oh, incidentally, Frank, you could use another six-pack.
I got a feeling I'm gonna murder them on the football games.
Frank, that's the solution to the money.
- No, no.
It's ridiculous. it won't work.
- Why won't it?
I don't know anything about placing a bet.
I wouldn't know where to go, what to do.
I gotta call Ernie with my football bets.
The Rams-Patriot game starts in 25 minutes.
- We'll have to take in another partner.
- Who?
- Him.
- Did you say something, Frank?
- Link?
Do you think that's wise?
- What's wise?
Who are you talking to?
Ask how many football games we can bet on.
- Who are you talking to?
- Ask him!
- It's crazy.
- Buddy?
- Who?
- How many football games on TV today?
Three pro games.
East, Midwest, Far West.
Who?
- Brief him.
- Have you got a tape machine going?
I don't think it's a good idea, but OK.
You know, I'd say you were talking to the cat.
I was.
Right.
Look, Frank, this can happen to anybody in government service.
That's why they have staff psychiatrists.
- Link.
Take a deep breath.
- OK.
- Remember that artichoke?
- Uh-huh.
Well, it all started when this spaceship...
- Spaceship?
- ...from another galaxy landed in a field.
Frank, let me get this straight, OK?
Now, you're trying to tell me that your little pussycat came from another planet from another galaxy in a spacecraft and landed on Earth?
- Is that it?
- That's right.
- You're squeezing.
- See?
You heard him talk.
Uh-huh.
Look.
I mean, I don't know how you're doing your little trick, you know.
But I gotta tell you something, it's dumb.
Very dumb.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna drink your last beer, watch three football games on your television set, and then I'm going home, because this is dumb, Frank.
Real dumb.
Now, that's dumb.
Aw, Link, look.
Listen to me for one minute.
I don't want to hear it, Frank.
I don't want to hear it, Frank!
- OK?
- OK.
Thank you.
That does it, Frank!
I'm going home and watch the Metropolitan Opera.
Oh, now, Link.
We need your help.
Jake needs your help!
I don't want to hear about it!
You're the only person I know who knows how to place a bet. I don't anything about...
What kind of a spaceship?
You're beautiful.
(phone rings)
You're down 200, sucker.
Would you like to double it?
Earnest Ernie's Sporting Club.
Weasel speaking.
What's your pleasure?
Yeah.
Give me four balls.
I'll double it.
- What do you say, Sarasota Slim?
- l say give him five.
The man says give him five.
You got it.
Honest Harry holds.
Link, can you make it fast?
We got a hot one on the rotisserie.
- Can I trust him?
- Would a crook be named Honest Harry?
You wanna bet what?
Hold on.
- Hey, Ernie.
Ernie, come here.
- Yeah.
Link wants to take his winnings from Sweet Jake and parlay the three football games.
You're kidding?
A three-game parlay?
Yeah.
It'll come to 1 20 G's if he makes it.
It's like taking candy from a baby, Weasel.
- He's down.
- You're down.
(man) Hold it right there.
General?
General?
Fingerprints, sir.
They found fingerprints.
On top of the hull, inside the cabin.
And they are the prints of a human being.
So whatever power brought this ship here was aided by some disloyal American.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with a collaborator.
I want the face that matches these prints.
Use the computer.
- Double pronto, sir.
- General!
General!
- Look at this.
They found more.
- What in blazes is that?
Fine hair, sir.
The pilot was wearing a fur coat.
Even more important, we found tiny prints in a claw-like pattern, like a pussycat's.
Pussycat?
Why aren't I hearing some tickety-tacks?
What about the fingerprints?
- There's a printout about to come through.
- Sir.
What do you want me to do with this?
- Get it checked, sir.
- Coming through, sir.
(Stilton) "ID
- Wilson, Frank.
Doctor.
Social Security, 631 -07-0829."
"1 951 to '55.
US Navy.
'55 to '62 Caltech."
"Current employment, theoretician." ERL?
!
- That's my Dr. Wilson!
- The scoundrel.
We'll have him in the slammer within the hour.
And blow the whole ball game?
Gentlemen, we're after Mr. Big, and this double-crossing fink is gonna lead us to him.
To find the rat, tail the cat.
- Cat?
- It's just an expression.
(football commentary on TV)
- Want a peanut, Jake?
- No, thanks.
I'll wait till Frank gets back.
- The Rams still ahead?
- Ahead?
The Rams won the game.
And without Jake's help.
Without your help, buddy.
Let's open the six-pack.
What will you have, Jake?
- Did you get some more of that tuna?
- Yeah, yeah.
Coming right up.
(TV) There's the two-minute warning.
Oilers leading 2 1- 1 9.
Houston driving.
- Another one in the bag.
- (knocking)
- Come in.
- Frank?
Uh-huh?
Hi.
Lucybelle insisted on coming, too.
- Coming?
- Yeah, the picnic.
Oh, the picnic.
- Beer, Liz?
- No, thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- Uh... (sneezes)
- Is his croup worse?
- Whose?
- Jake's.
- Oh.
Yeah.
Right.
I was up all night.
- Really?
- It's gone into hyperzemia.
What's hyperzemia?
- It's what Jake's got.
- What did your doctor do for him?
- Gave him two aspirin.
- Two aspirin?
- What's that?
What's happening, Frank?
- l don't know.
Two aspirin.
No wonder you're feeling worse.
- How did he get the ball?
- Interception.
- What this cat needs is some expert help.
- Get him.
- Dr. Wenger.
- Get him.
OK.
I'll go get him.
I'll be right back.
(Frank) Get him.
Somebody tackle him.
- Hi, sweetie.
Can I get you anything?
- (Link) OK.
Out of bounds on the 30.
Jake, why didn't you do something?
And spoil everybody's fun?
Look, guys, there's plenty of time.
You've got terrific whiskers.
Jake, will you pay attention?
They're within field-goal range. lf they make it, we're sunk.
No problem.
Believe me.
A little tuna, sweetheart?
Oh, Jake, concentrate, please.
The next few seconds could be crucial.
- Time out.
- (Liz) I appreciate it, Doctor.
At least you could have waited till the game was over. I have $1 0 on Chicago.
- You've got it on.
What's happening?
- Time out.
This is Dr. Wenger.
Dr. Wenger, here's the patient.
I definitely think he needs your attention.
All right.
- How did they get to the 30?
- (Link) Interception.
- Happened while we were in the elevator.
- (TV) ...or a field goal?
(Liz) What do you think?
- l think they should try for a field goal.
- About the cat.
Hmm?
Oh, he's tense, he's very tense.
The shoulder muscles are all bunched up.
- Where do you want to examine him?
- Right here will be fine.
OK.
Let me get this out of the way.
Also, let's, first thing, get this collar off.
Hey!
Good thinking, Chicago.
(TV) This year. he's never missed inside the 35-yard line.
- Get through that line now.
- That guy can't kick a ball 60 yards.
- Block that kick.
Block that kick.
- (meowing)
Will you calm down now?
Hold the cat, please.
Jake, you better do something.
- Where's his collar?
- Block that...
- It's right here, Frank.
- Huh?
- Give it to me, Liz.
Give it to me.
- Frank, I'm just gonna hold the...
- I'm gonna give him a sedative.
- No, don't do that!
Frank, let go of the cat.
There's the snap.
It's down.
The kick is up.
It's long enough.
It's straight enough.
It's...
It's...
It's flat!
I've never seen anything like it.
The ball flattened out in midair.
There's the gun.
- Jake?
- The Oilers have won it 2 1- 1 9.
I told you not to do that!
I only came here as a favor to a neighbor.
As a rule, I do not make house calls.
You sure picked a dumb time to break your rule.
Dr. Link!
Look, Dr. Wenger, please forgive him.
He's a new cat-owner.
Jake.
Jake, it's me, Jake.
Oh, Frank, we're finished.
He's blotto.
Well, look on the bright side.
San Diego could still win.
Yeah, and San Diego could still lose.
And where does that leave this poor little guy?
He's blown his rendezvous and my 1 500 clams.
That was very rude, Frank.
- Liz, butt out.
- What?
- Cancel the bet.
Call Ernie.
- He'll never buy it.
- Look, what's going on here?
- Jake, we got problems.
Speak to me.
Is everybody crazy?
The line is busy.
We'll never get through.
He's taking bets.
- We'd better get down there.
- Like yesterday.
Just a minute, Frank.
I would like...
No, I demand an explanation.
What's going on?
- Later, Liz.
- No.
Now.
We have got exactly six minutes before that game starts.
- Watch it, Link.
I'm a black belt.
- OK.
We'll tell you in the elevator.
Remember that meeting we had with Dr. Heffel and General Stilton at the ERL?
(Liz) Outer space?
- Frank Wilson, are you putting me on?
- No, no.
Remember that artichoke?
Dydee One calling Hopscotch.
Come in, Big Cheese.
This is Big Cheese.
Go ahead, Dydee One.
Do you still have contact with the subject?
Yes, sir.
Also that garbage expert and the dame from the car pool.
And they're all going into Earnest Ernie's pool hall.
Looks like a Mafia tie-in.
Mafia?
What kind of an operation you running down there, Heffel?
Lucky!
(laughs)
Really lucky.
Ernie?
Ernie?
Excuse me.
Ernie?
- Hi, Ernie.
- Well, look who's here.
Hiya, Doc.
Uh, Ernie, I wanna cancel my Chargers bet.
- You wanna cancel your Chargers bet?
- Yeah, cancel my Chargers bet.
Really?
Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Just a hunch, sort of.
Hey, not a bad hunch.
The Chargers are ten points behind.
- Already?
- (cheering) 1 6, boss, 1 6.
Steelers just scored another one.
Sorry, Doc.
Is he taking a nap?
- Yeah.
- Is that TV picture still out?
Well, there goes 1 20,000.
1 500 of which is mine.
- Isn't there anything you can do?
- Not while Jake is out.
Jake, wake up.
- Is he breathing?
- He's snoring.
OK.
OK.
Isn't there anything else we can bet on?
Yeah.
Maybe we could get lucky.
Another football game?
- Next Sunday.
- Basketball?
- Tuesday night.
- Hockey?
- Hockey?
- Hockey.
Ernie, is there a hockey game today that we could put a few bucks on?
Sorry.
Horse race?
Boxing?
- Demolition derby?
Anything to get even.
- No.
But if you want a little action, there's always my good friend Sarasota Slim.
- Sarasota Slim?
- Yes.
He indulges occasionally in a friendly pool game with a slight wager on the side.
- Nothing doing.
- Why not?
- He's a hustler.
- Who isn't?
OK.
It's a bet.
What are the odds?
You against Sarasota Slim?
- Right.
- Frank.
Because I want to give you a chance to break even and because I like your style, let's say 8 to 1 .
That's all?
What about him?
- Me?
- Link?
Well, considering the shape he's in, I'd say maybe 1 0 to 1 .
- Ohh.
What about the lady?
- Me?
- Liz?
- Considering the shape she's in, 20 to 1 .
- OK.
You got a bet.
- Frank!
Arch, set 'em up.
Another sucker just swam into the net.
Frank, I don't know anything about this game.
Are you bananas?
That guy can make a pool ball sit up and do the boogaloo.
I know, but I've got the equalizer...
the collar.
- How are you gonna do that?
Jake's out.
- I've used it, to repair the spaceship.
- You?
- Yes.
I've flown.
Charlie, give me the special, and heavy on the onions.
- Taking a nap?
- Yeah.
Throw in a few chili peppers, huh?
- Frank, I don't want to take the risk...
- Liz, you've got to do it.
I'm desperate.
No money, no gold.
No gold, no liftoff.
But... (clears throat)
But if we deliver, look what we get in return... the solution to half the problems on this planet.
- Just show me how to hold the pole.
- Good girl.
We need a stake.
I've got about 1 2 bucks.
It's in my hip pocket.
Will you get it for me?
- OK, that's 1 2.
How much do you have?
- Me?
I think I got 20.
- 20?
Liz?
- Uh...
- l just have my mad money.
- Give it to us.
Please?
Come on.
Boy, when this dame gets mad, she gets mad.
I was going to buy a whole spring wardrobe, Link.
- OK.
Ernie.
- Boss, here's the bankroll.
- Ernie, we bet 300 at 20 to 1 .
- Check.
Not in your lifetime, Ernie.
Honest Harry holds.
All right, you want Honest Harry, you got Honest Harry.
300 at 20 to 1 .
That's 6,000 clams.
And here's our 300.
Earnest Ernie, 6,000.
The mark, 300.
6300.
And may the best man win.
Or woman, as the case may be.
Young lady, it's your break.
Come on, don't be so stingy with the onions.
Here, take the collar, Liz.
OK, here.
Link, keep your eye on him.
If he blinks just once...
Miss?
Do you mind?
We're waiting.
- Now, that's a sandwich.
Right?
- (sniffs)
Right.
- Taking a nap.
- Naturally.
Nice break, young lady.
Very nice.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink anything,
- but there's always tomorrow.
- (laughter)
Show her how to do it.
OK, Slim, go get her.
Ooh, I can't watch this. (laughs)
- Frank, I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.
(ball pockets. applause)
(ball pockets. applause)
(man) Attaway, Slim.
Attaway, baby.
I guess we are licked.
If only Jake hadn't got knocked out... (whispers) Frank!
Frank, look.
Jake!
Jake?
Frank, he must have just woke up.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Yeah.
Where am I?
What happened?
I'm Liz Bartlett.
I'm responsible for your being...
- Liz, Liz, sshh.
- Oh, well.
Jake, we have got to win this pool game.
That's money in the bank.
Look at it!
Honest Harry, guess who's here?
Ernie?
Here's our last 60 bucks.
What are the odds now?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
- No bet.
- No bet?
It's part of my code of ethics.
Always leave the sucker rent money.
That's not fair!
Honest Harry?
If the mark wants to go complete top city, he's got a constitutional right.
And I stand on it.
The odds, Ernie?
It's ridiculous.
But if I didn't have no principles, I'd say 1 00 to 1 .
Suppose...
Suppose she gives Sarasota Slim 1 2 balls?
What a sense of humor!
300 to 1 .
- And the break.
- The break?
500 to 1 .
And blindfolded.
- What?
- Blindfolded!
- 2,000 to 1 .
- You're on.
$60 at 2,000 to 1 .
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Are you seriously serious?
- You're not thinking of welching, are you?
- But I thought you was putting me on.
Earnest Ernie, it would not do your reputation any credit if word was to circulate that you reneged on a wager duly offered and accepted.
- Get the big bundle, Weasel.
- But, boss...
Get it!
All right.
Let me understand this.
Slim gets 1 2 balls and the break?
- And she shoots blindfolded.
- (laughs)
She'll never get to the table.
1 20 Gs, boss.
Don't put it away, Honest Harry, you ain't gonna hold it long.
All right, Slim.
Show 'em no mercy.
Nice.
Nice break, Slim.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink nothing, but there's always tomorrow.
- l believe I'm up.
- Hold it.
Blindfolded.
Oh.
Could you back off?
(applause)
You did it, Jake.
You did it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
it was really nothing.
Thank you.
Frank, we won!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, all of you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about things being upside down, but I took these pictures at risk of life and limb.
There's the cat, sir.
Notice his collar?
Well, well.
What did you think of it, Mr. Olympus?
It's just mind-boggling, isn't it?
I mean, it boggled my mind.
Did it boggle yours, sir?
Thank you, Omar.
Yes, Mr. Stallwood, you are quite correct.
it is "mind-boggling," as you so graphically put it.
The possibilities are infinite.
A revolution in transportation, space exploration, colonizing the planets.
The man who owns the secret of this device could control...
The world, sir?
The universe.
Oh, my!
Well, then, sir, I don't suppose it would be out of place to suggest a bonus.
- A bonus?
- A small bonus.
Mr. Stallwood, if I gain the secret of that device, you may well become a very rich man.
I may?
Oh, sir, I... really may?
Omar, prepare the copter.
We leave at once.
I must have that collar.
I will have that collar.
OK.
All set, General.
- Is it programmed?
- All the pertinent information fed in.
- Everything we know.
- Question number one, sir.
Question number one.
Who is the pilot?
it is a pussycat!
This machine is having a nervous breakdown.
Get on the ball, young man.
Feed that information through again.
Reassess.
Yes, sir.
- General Stilton, sir.
- What is it, Sergeant?
That purchase Dr. Link made... we checked it out.
It's a large quantity of gold.
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.
It's a Machiavellian conspiracy.
Radio.
This is Big Cheese calling Dydee One.
Where are you, Dydee One?
Outside the suspect's apartment.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Another printout, General.
Of all the...
Wait a minute.
Radio.
- Dydee One.
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't they carry a cat into that pool hall?
- Yes, sir, they did.
Gentlemen, it's time to move in.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
$1 20,000 in one lump sum.
Jake, how'd you like to hang around and watch me parlay this into a fortune?
- l wish I could hang around.
- I'm sorry, Jake.
The time?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, Lucy.
- l guess I'd better reduce the gold.
- Reduce it?
- What are you talking about?
- It's a new concept in calculating mass.
On Jake's planet, they use a system based on content, rather than on the quantitative...
Frank!
You've got a whole lifetime to explain that.
I've got less than an hour.
Now, stand back, everybody.
- All right, don't move!
All hands in the air!
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Frank Wilson?
- You can't butt in here!
- Dr. Frank Wilson, you are under arrest.
- And the pussycat, General.
And the pussycat.
- Read them their rights, Colonel.
- Captain?
- Sergeant?
- Never mind.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right...
- Good heavens.
- Frank...
- What happened?
- (Frank) They're frozen.
Holy mackerel!
Now they're on to us, how are we to get into Hopscotch?
You can't zap the whole base.
- Yeah, well, I'll think of something.
- They'll probably be on alert.
First things first.
Let's get this gold reduced, then we'll worry about getting on the base.
Now stand back.
OK.
Here goes.
Ohh.
That is unbelievable.
Oh, Jake.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
(Link) Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. I think I've got the perfect way to get us onto the base.
Maybe we ought to give 'em a buzz.
Think we ought to give 'em a buzz?
Yeah, give 'em a buzz.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in.
Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
- What's the military doing here?
- This could be complicated, sir.
What isn't?
- Get that door closed!
- Uh-oh.
What does it all mean?
it means it's exceptionally complicated.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Ah, here comes General Cheese.
I mean, Stilton.
- (Frank) Wait.
Hold Jake for a minute.
- Yes.
- How do I look?
- Could you hold Lucy for a minute?
- Do I look like a general?
- Oh, well...
Frank, you look very commanding.
- That'll have to do.
Let's go.
- OK.
He got the cat.
That's the cat!
Where's the general going with those two?
That's the general?
It's not?
Open your door!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Halt!
Halt in the name of the US...
Fantastic.
- Listen, good luck, huh?
- Yeah.
Be careful.
- Bye, Lucybelle.
Thanks for everything.
- Yeah, yeah.
Let's go.
Bye.
- They've escaped?
- Yes.
But, fortunately for us, they left something very valuable behind.
(car door opens)
- General Stilton?
- Of course!
Of course.
I'll sign you in, sir.
General Stilton and cat.
Is the cat cleared, sir?
- What do you think?
- Sorry, sir.
I want the hangar open.
All personnel out.
We're moving the ship.
But sir, if we order 'em out of the hangar, how are you gonna...
- Soldier!
- Out of the hangar, sir.
Yes, sir.
Get the hangar doors open.
All personnel out of the hangar on the double.
- First, let's get the ship out of the hangar.
- Check.
..to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you're being...
(sniggering)
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Hold it right here, Frank.
1 30 to countdown.
Hurry.
Insert the gold in the microtransformer.
Right, right.
- Got it.
- Good.
Now let's see if we have contact.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
- Where's the microphone?
- Frank!
OK, OK.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
Hi there. fella.
See you made it with nothing to spare.
- We had problems.
- We are 1 05 to liftoff.
Coming in on ray 0392.
Adjust transmuter.
- Adjustment made.
- Countdown starts at 20.
Set clinometers.
- Clinometers set.
Give me a printout.
- Coming your way without delay.
- That's another cat?
- Oh, yeah.
A real mother.
- l gotta get to that spaceship right away.
- Who are you?
A friend of Frank Wil...
I mean General Stilton.
A very good friend.
Let's go.
Open the gate.
My car!
- Them, too.
- Never mind.
Let's get down to Hopscotch.
- Sergeant.
- Captain.
Colonel.
- General.
- Oh, get in!
- (Mother Ship) Counting down.
- Hey, Frank!
Hold it, sir, right there.
General, this man says...
Hey!
You're not General Stilton.
- Frank.
- What are you doing here?
Frank, it's a nightmare.
Liz has been captured by Stallwood.
Have you been hitting the beer?
Stallwood of Supplies?
He's an agent for some guy named Olympus, a power-crazed creep who's...
- He's holding her for ransom.
- Lucybelle, too?
Yeah, he wants that collar, Jake.
It's the collar or Liz.
- Where is she?
- I'm going with you, Frank.
No, no, you don't want to get stuck here on Earth.
You're responsible to your mission.
- But I'm the reason for the mess they're in.
- Do you know where they're taking her?
- Place called Dailey's Airport.
- Do you know where it is?
Let's go.
- Frank...
- Jake, you're going home.
Now, get in there.
So long, buddy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
5. 4 3. 2.
ignite.
Bye, Jake.
Drop us a card.
OK, you clowns.
Let's move it.
Let's go.
Jake!
Jake, this is insane.
You're here forever, on Earth.
You're wasting time.
The airport!
General, look!
(General) Good heavens!
That's my car.
Get the police on the radio.
- Hello, Sequoia?
- Turn around!
Here comes a car.
It's Wilson.
Yeah, and Link.
And the cat!
They're here.
They've come.
Naturally.
You knew they would.
You knew it.
We've won.
Now they will have turn over the cat and we will turn over the girl.
We will?
We won't?
it may be difficult to explain your part in this after the young lady's gone to the police.
Oh, dear.
You wouldn't dare?
Frank, that must be the chopper.
(sirens wailing)
It's the police, sir.
It's a trap.
The fools!
Get us airborne.
(Jake) Watch it!
- They're getting away!
- Yeah.
But look who's arriving - the army and the police.
We have to follow that copter.
What kind of an airport is this?
Where are the planes?
Follow me.
Oh, you can't fly this, Jake.
It's a wreck.
Look at that propeller - it's half gone.
- Are you coming or staying?
- I'm coming.
I'm staying.
OK, tovarisch.
Ponimayete po-russki?
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
- Parlez-vous Francis?
- What?
- All right, Dr. Garbage Expert.
Who's your accomplice?
Who's flying that plane?
Uh...
General, you're not gonna believe this.
There they are.
- It's Wilson and the cat.
- How did they get that wreck in the air?
The power that cat possesses is awesome.
You betcha, Charlie, and if you know what's good for you, you'll land...
- Quiet!
- OK.
Faster, Omar, faster.
Get close.
Use the collar to force them to land.
No chance.
It's taking all I got just to keep this crate flying.
Don't panic.
We'll think of something.
What's happening?
Why aren't they doing something?
Of course!
They're afraid of harming the girl.
Turn on them, Omar.
The advantage is ours.
What's happening?
Why are they turning around?
Straight at them, Omar.
Drive them down.
Frank!
Jake!
(Frank screams)
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake.
Jake.
Turn this thing over.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake.
Jake!
Frank, are you OK?
- What are they trying to do?
- Force us down.
They probably figured out that we've got a problem.
Hold on.
Here they come.
- They're still on our tail.
- Don't panic.
On top of them, Omar.
Smash them down!
Whoa!
(Jake) I see 'em.
I see 'em.
Look out.
Jake!
Jake!
- Here they come again.
Jake.
- Yeah, yeah.
Fruitcake.
Frank, watch out!
Jake, Jake.
(Jake yowls)
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
Jake.
Oh, dear.
Jake.
Break off!
(gasps)
Buzz them again, Omar, and this time, everybody open fire.
(gunshot)
(coughing)
- What happened?
- You happened, you imbecile!
- How bad is it, Omar?
- He got the controls.
They're locked.
When the fuel runs out, we're through.
Shall we bail out?
We have no choice.
Bail out?
Where are you going?
I haven't got a parachute, either.
- Then you have a problem.
- l haven't got a parachute either.
Then you have the same problem.
Wait!
No, wait!
Wait a minute!
I d...
I don't want to die!
Oh, swell.
Frank!
Frank!
(groans)
Yes, Mr. President.
Absolutely, Mr. President.
We're just waiting for them to land and we'll pass that on.
- Yes, sir.
- What'd he say?
Jake is to be treated as the representative of a friendly power, with generous borrowing credit.
In exchange for bases, of course.
Look, sir, chutes.
They bailed out.
Holy mackerel!
Who's flying the chopper?
Frank!
Easy, Liz.
Don't panic.
- What are you gonna do, Frank?
- l don't know, but I have to do something.
Hand me Lucybelle!
- Careful, Frank!
- l got her.
- Just hold on, honey, and we'll get Liz.
- Get us up closer to the copter.
Right.
Liz, when we get close enough, grab my hand.
Frank, you're too far away!
(Frank) Closer, Jake.
Closer!
Grab my hand, Liz.
Grab it!
Grab it!
Liz, careful.
- OK.
- Now grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Good.
That's good.
That's good.
- Now grab my hand and step off.
- Step off?
- Liz!
- Huh?
Ohh...
- Frank, I don't think this is gonna work.
- All right.
We'll try it again.
Never mind.
We'll try something else.
- All right, put your feet on my shoulders.
- What?
Put your feet right there, on my shoulders.
No!
Liz, do it!
OK.
OK.
- Oh...
Oh...
Ohh!
- Whoa!
You see?
Everything's gonna be OK, Lucybelle.
Just relax.
Jake!
Jake, what are you doing?
You know, when I saw you up in that chopper, I just...
Huh?
Well, honey, looks like you're stuck with me.
(explosion)
Don't just hang there.
Get me out of this.
- Don't worry.
I'll get you loose.
- What are you doing with that?
Fortunately, I never go anywhere without my Swiss Army knife.
Idiot!
(man) All rise.

What is it?
What is that light?
I don't know.
You stay right here, Edna.
Don't leave the house.
I'm gonna take a look at it.
Come on, Dutch.
Chicken.
Holy mackerel!
This is earth probe Zunar J5 calling mother ship.
Zunar J5 calling mother ship.
Come in, mother ship.
This is earth probe Zunar J5 calling mother ship.
Zunar j5, this is mother ship.
Have you completed emergency landing?
Affirmative, mother.
Request repair party.
Negative, Zunar J5.
You'll have to effect emergency repairs yourself.
And rendezvous with us at grid dissect 8304.
At 69 hours minus 17.
That's an awfully tight squeeze, mother.
Unavoidable, Zunar.
Next mission to this galaxy due in 115.
- Days?
- Years.
Good luck, Zunar J5.
Over and out.
Yeah.
So long, mother.
I don't see any hammer and sickle.
Do you, Colonel?
Maybe it's on the inside, General.
No sign of life, either.
Get me the Pentagon, red priority.
I wanna speak to the chiefs, Colonel.
Captain?
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Sequoia here.
Come in, Rover.
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Wipe it out of your minds.
You understand?
You've seen nothing and heard nothing.
Yes, sir.
We'll want them later for debriefing.
Take their names.
Colonel?
Captain.
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Names, please?
Name's Charlie Cooney.
General Stilton!
We're ready when you are, sir.
Bullhorn.
Yes, sir.
On to Hopscotch.
All right, men.
Let's move it!
Let's move out.
Colonel.
Captain.
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
When we get to Hopscotch,
I want mark-four priority security.
Armor, personnel, guard dogs, the works.
And not one word to public relations.
Not one word.
- You got that, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
- You got that, captain?
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant?
- Got it.
Well?
It's a brilliant technological achievement, General.
There's absolutely nothing like it in the state of the art.
You trying to tell me something, Allison?
It's definitely not one of ours, General.
How about Russia?
Certainly not Russia.
It's far beyond the capabilities of...
Okay, Allison.
Lay it on the line.
Whose is it?
I don't know, General.
Well, we better find out.
I wanna know who made that thing,
Who flew it and where it came from.
Colonel?
Yes, sir.
Contact Sigcomm on our radio.
Get Hungerford at air.
Call Steinmetz at Johns Hopkins,
Lasser, Billings, Cranhammer.
Get them iqs off their tennis courts.
Yes, sir.
Double pronto!
Because if we don't find out where that thing came from,
This country could be in trouble,
Big, big trouble.
Colonel.
Captain.
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
You say it's not man-made, Allison.
What's that leave us?
Outer space.
With no sign of the pilot.
Big, big trouble.
While you and I are talking this very minute,
Some slimy green-headed, 12-legged creep.
Could be crawling into the White House.
Big, big trouble.
We're up against genius.
We'd better come up with some genius of our own.
I believe, General, you've already met.
My administrative assistant, Dr. Corday.
And I'd like to introduce some of the other members of our team.
Dr. Robeson of Caltech, who's our expert on fossil fuel.
Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins.
Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett, who heads thermal.
Dr. Norman Link, who's been doing some intriguing work.
In garbage research.
- So what?
- Dr. Link.
Just a second, Dr. Heffel.
I have to relay some vital information to a colleague.
Yes.
This is our hard-water man, Dr. Leach.
Right, Ernie.
The Lakers by a point and a half for 100 bucks.
When will you have the line on Philly and the New York Knicks?
I'd like you to meet Mr. Jurist,
Who also is involved in thermal.
And of course I'm sure you're familiar with our...
And there's Dr. Banford, Professor Epstein,
Doctors Davidson and Barrett,
And, of course, this is Dr. Humphrey, our head of nuclear.
Mr. Stallwood, our head of procurement and supplies.
Stallwood, what are you doing here?
Well, sir, when the call went out.
For an emergency meeting, I naturally assumed...
You assumed wrong.
Scientists.
Double-A clearance only.
Out.
But Dr. Heffel, I might have a contribution to make...
If we need any sharp pencils, I'll send for you.
But, Dr. Heffel...
Out.
Sorry, General.
Where was I?
Yes.
Professor...
Dr. Heffel, I didn't come here for a roll call,
I came to pick some brains.
Are they all here?
Yes.
I'd say these are our top people.
Then let's get to it!
I understand, General.
Attention, everyone.
Dr. Link.
Well, that's it, Professor.
I'll call tomorrow with more input.
Bye.
All right, sergeant, open it.
Drapes.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is top secret.
The united states government will countenance no leaks.
Now...
What's holding it up?
Nothing.
It's amazing.
Where did you get it?
What is it?
A propulsion unit of some sort, ladies and gentlemen.
Never mind where we got it.
We have other experts working on that.
What we want to know from you is,
What makes it tick?
Okay, let's have your hypothesis.
The energy source could be atomic.
We've checked on that.
Negative.
Direct conversion, utilizing thermionic...
Checked out.
Negative.
It's not propelled by garbage, I know that.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Come in, Olympus.
I'll call you about it later.
Mr. Olympus?
This is Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something very big and very...
Jellyfish.
Your man in ERL?
Yes, sir.
That Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something.
No, sir.
I think you'll find this a great deal.
More interesting than my last report.
Right now, Dr. Heffel is in a secret meeting.
With a four-star General and a whole gaggle of scientists.
What are they meeting about?
Well, I don't know, sir.
It's a secret.
Get in there and find out?
Do any of you have a solid evaluation?
Not a guess,
A solid premise?
Do you?
Well?
Do you think it might be fruitful.
To bring Dr. Wilson into this discussion, Dr. Heffel?
Wilson?
Yes.
He might very well come up with an applicable theory.
Don't be ridiculous.
Who's Dr. Wilson?
He's in my carpool.
That is, we live in the same building.
That certainly qualifies him.
No, what I'm trying to say is,
He's a very bright, young physicist.
Who's come here recently on loan from Caltech.
A loan, I might add, that is bearing absolutely no interest.
He's a little unorthodox, but a brilliant theorist.
Dr. Bartlett, General Stilton isn't interested in...
Get him.
What?
Get him.
His output couldn't be any less than what we've gotten so far.
Yes, General.
He really has an unusual mind.
Well, Dr. Wilson?
It's beautiful.
Don't you have any other observation?
Only that it looks like an artichoke, sir.
We know it looks like an artichoke, Wilson.
What makes it tick?
Mayonnaise?
Negative.
No, no, I was only joking, sir.
I do have a theory, sir,
Actually in line with the work I've been doing.
I have a hunch it's tapping the primal mainstream, General.
The "primal mainstream"?
The primal mainstream, yes, it's everywhere, General,
Only on different frequencies.
The whole electro-magnetic spectrum.
Cosmic, gamma,
X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light,
Infrared, radio waves...
And do you know.
How much we finite human beings can probably tune into?
With our senses?
Less than five percent.
The universe makes its own energy, General.
We even make it ourselves.
Yes, take biofeedback, for instance.
Why, if I taped terminals to your head, General,
Your brain could run an electric train.
Electric train?
I'm sorry, General, I thought...
Perhaps electric train wasn't the most apt...
That'll be all, Wilson.
Thank you very much.
You let me have that for a couple of months, General.
And I promise you...
Thank you.
A couple of months?
Dr. Heffel?
Yes, General?
I want action.
You know, Drexel,
I've seen the most amazing thing.
Amazing.
But don't ask me to tell you about it.
It's classified.
Thank you, Drexel.
Well.
How did you get in here?
Now, look, you're asking for trouble.
Dr. Heffel isn't too crazy about animals in the building.
Fact is, he isn't too crazy about people in the building either.
What's your name?
Charlie?
Cuddles?
Jake?
Yes, yes.
You look like Jake.
That, Jake,
Is the Van Allen Belt.
Oil and coal is not going to do it, you know.
And one of these days, that sun of ours is going to turn into a big black hole.
You know where it's really at, Jake?
Electromagnetism.
We're loaded with it.
You know, it's crazy, but you almost look like.
You know what I'm talking about.
All right, give me a hand with this, Sergeant.
Easy, easy.
That's it.
Stallwood, administration emergency!
Hey, that's some fancy collar you got there.
Maybe I'll take you home with me.
My neighbor, Liz, has a cat named Lucybelle.
She's really cute.
And the cat's not bad either.
Liz!
Hi...
Ouch!
I've...
We were just talking about you.
Were you?
This is Jake.
I'm going to take him home with us.
You won't have to drive Professor Link and myself home tonight, Dr. Wilson.
Heffel's called a late meeting.
I don't mind waiting.
That won't be necessary.
We've made other arrangements.
How...
How about a cup of coffee?
No.
Chocolate chip cookie?
No!
Hey, are you sore or something?
Sore?
Sore?
Well, whatever gave you that idea?
What is it?
What did I do?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Mayonnaise?
Electric trains?
Well, now, look, really, all that...
That was just a joke, doctor.
Well, nobody laughed.
Especially the General.
Has he had water?
The General?
The cat.
Water?
Cats do get thirsty, you know.
Do you have a bowl?
...
A bowl.
Right here.
Yes.
Here.
Here.
Water?
Yes, right, water.
Look, Liz...
Dr. Bartlett.
Just because some General.
Lacks a sense of humor, now that's no reason...
Well, anyway, all I was trying to convey...
I'm really not interested, doctor.
Well, besides, I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's just that.
The magnitude of what the General showed us this afternoon.
Just bowled me over.
It did?
Completely.
Black.
What?
Didn't you offer me a cup of coffee?
Right.
Check.
Coming right up.
I just...
I really don't understand, that's all.
The man who wrote the article you did.
For The Scientific Quarterly, July 12th...
You read it?
Well, of course.
It was brilliant.
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.
We don't get much chance to talk in the carpool,
But I've been following your work in thermal.
You have?
Closely.
It's very impressive, very innovative.
Very attractive.
I mean, it's bound to attract attention.
Well...
I am writing an article at the moment.
And I would love to have your criticism.
Maybe at lunch or, even better, at dinner sometime?
Yeah, I'd like that.
When?
Tonight?
No, that's right, you've got that late meeting.
Well, that may not go all that late.
I should be out by 7:00.
Is that too late?
7:00 is beautiful.
Good.
Well...
Thanks for the coffee.
It was delicious.
I think she digs you.
I sure hope so.
Who said that?
I did.
And, Frank, we'd better get down to business.
Sit down.
We've gotta talk.
I'm running out of time, and it looks like you're the only one
I can depend on to help me.
It...
It's you?
It's not the mouse.
Now, sit down.
But your lips aren't moving.
You're not speaking.
Thought transference.
Nothing exceptional where I come from.
Now, sit.
My name is Zunar-J-5/9 Doric-4-7.
Zunar...
Why don't we just stay with Jake, okay?
Frank, last night, at 03 hours plus 13,
I made an emergency landing in a spaceship from another galaxy.
That so-called artichoke, it's from my craft.
But...
You're a cat.
Granted.
But you see, Frank, in our civilization,
That's as far as we needed to evolve.
We developed our brain to a fine point.
Now, man, on the other hand, rose off his four legs.
And developed tools, machinery, agriculture,
And a chronic pain in his lower back.
We developed tools for the mind.
This collar here, it amplifies brain power.
It...
It does what?
Well, it provides energy by which we...
Look, let me give you a demonstration.
Not a bad little tune.
Frank, this is really delicious.
What is it?
It's chopped kidney.
It's all they had at the deli.
It really hits the spot.
I'm gonna take a couple of cases for my trip back.
Sure beats the blah I've been eating.
Well, now back to my problem.
Frank, I need an answer.
What do you say?
Say about what?
Can I count on you to help me repair my spaceship?
Why me?
Because I like the way you think.
Your equations rather interest me.
In fact, they're really not bad at all.
For a human.
Really?
I'm on the right track?
Quite definitely.
But years away from a solution.
Frank, on my planet, we have an expression.
"you rub my fur, I'll rub yours."
How would you like to make a quantum jump?
You help me, and I'll give you a push in the right direction.
You're serious?
I'm serious.
You're telling me the truth?
The truth.
You really are from outer space?
I am from outer space.
Even though you're a cat?
Frank!
Is it a deal?
It's a deal.
That's...
We better get moving.
I've got to make repairs.
To my ship by 5:13 Sunday for liftoff,
Or I'll miss the rendezvous with the mother ship.
Right...
I'll get my sweater.
Do you think that you can find your way back to that airport?
No problem.
I made a memory imprint.
With the collar?
Right.
Fantastic.
How developed does your brain have to be to use that collar?
Not very.
In fact, you could handle it.
You wanna try?
Well...
Do we have time?
Why not?
Look, just...
Just grab hold of it.
Easy!
Don't take it off.
I mean, without that collar,
I'm just an average cat.
Right, right.
Right.
Okay?
Okay.
Now just concentrate.
Concentrate.
Think levitation.
Levitation.
You're as light as a feather.
Look at me.
I'm floating!
It's just plain incredible!
Hey, look, one hand.
Watch it, Frank!
You're losing your concentration.
Yeah.
Hi, Frank.
Gotta use your set.
The ball goes crosscourt to Brown.
He brings it up into the front court...
What were you doing up in the air?
Astronaut exercises.
Link, I'm busy.
Yeah.
Well, just forget I'm here.
It's the last minute of the game,
And Francine throws me out of the apartment.
Why does she throw me out of the apartment?
For one lousy cigar burn on the chair.
When did you get a cat?
Jake's not my cat.
He's just visiting.
Hi, Jake.
Link, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Do you mind, Frank?
Okay, I am back in.
Remember, the score's tied at 108.
Atlanta has the ball and a basket could win it.
Win it?
Man!
And I gave a point and a half.
Well, there goes my 100 bucks.
Come on, defense.
Come on, guys.
Man to man, we'll...
The crowd is really on its feet now.
He's alone in the baseline and closely guarded by king.
King steals the ball.
What a play!
Here come the lakers to the attack.
Five seconds left.
Pete Burt puts up a shot.
But a prayer, there's no chance.
Wait...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
I don't believe it.
He scores!
He made it in the last second, and the Lakers will win it by two.
Unbelievable!
Frank, did you see that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Link, I'm really gonna have to ask you to leave.
Yeah, I could use another beer, Frank.
Yeah, I'm out of beer, I'm sorry.
Okay.
How about a ginger ale?
I'm out of that, too.
Could I at least finish my cigar?
Link, please.
Frank, I'd like to have a little celebration.
I haven't won a bet in two weeks!
I'll see you later.
The basketball game?
You did that?
Frank, any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
Besides, it seemed the fastest way to get rid of that flake.
Now, let's go.
I've got less than 36 hours to liftoff.
Right...
Do you think I ought to carry you?
I mean, just so people don't suspect you're not an ordinary cat?
Good thinking, Frank.
Besides, my left paw's been acting up again.
An old football injury?
Actually, no.
Polo.
Now let's go.
You...
What about getting into Hopscotch?
It's got to be heavily guarded.
I'll handle that, too.
It's fantastic.
Hi.
Hi, this is Lucybelle.
What'd you say you call him?
- Jake.
- Jake, right.
Jake, this is Lucybelle.
I thought they could get acquainted while we're at dinner.
At dinner?
Yeah.
It was tonight, wasn't it?
Right...
Right.
Right, yes.
And...
I was just about to call you.
Something came up.
And I'm afraid you're going to have to give me a rain check.
Well, of course.
It really doesn't matter.
But it does.
It matters a lot, Liz.
Dr. Bartlett.
You see, what happened was...
It's Jake.
He took sick.
Suddenly.
Out of the blue.
Really?
What is it?
I think it's...
Tasmanian croup.
You poor thing.
You know, he sounds terrible.
Yeah.
You'd better not let her get too close.
Stop milking it.
What?
I said I was about to rush him to the vet's.
The vet.
That's a good idea, Frank.
Hey, do you know there's a very good vet.
Who lives right in the building?
A Dr. Wenger.
He specializes in cats.
I'm sure he'd be glad to take a look at him.
Yeah, well, Jake prefers.
A General practitioner.
Look, I'm sorry about dinner, Liz.
I'll make it up to you.
How about a picnic?
I'd love it!
Tomorrow?
You handled that situation very well, Frank.
I didn't enjoy lying to Liz.
She's a very unusual person.
Her kitty-cat's not too bad either.
There's plenty of time for that.
That's all right for you to say.
But I've been confined to a spaceship for five months.
The ship's in that big hangar.
There's got to be a way in.
It's locked.
No problem.
Come on, come on.
Right, right.
The coast is clear.
Let's go!
There she is.
Somebody's coming.
Somebody's coming, Frank!
I know, I know.
What's happening?
It's all clear.
Let's go!
It's this way.
Forget it.
Forget it.
It wears off in 20 minutes.
It's harmless.
He won't remember a thing.
Come on, let's go.
Incredible.
An older model, but in pretty good shape.
For a rig with nearly a trillion miles on it.
Well, now let's see what we can do about getting it operational again.
We've only got 34 hours left.
Right.
Through here?
Put me down.
It's just incredible.
The artichoke.
I was right.
What's this?
Control panel?
Sort of.
And this?
Computer.
Then this must be the readout?
Frank, later.
I'll explain it all later, I promise.
First, we have to disengage the transducer system.
But how?
Take that neo-mag neutralizing intercog,
And you'll find the transducer switch on top of the ship.
Just coordinate with me.
Well, how do I get up there?
Fly.
Fly?
You mean use your collar?
Don't be ridiculous.
We carry a spare.
Just concentrate, and when you get on top,
Engage the switch with the intercog.
And thought-project "seven max triad."
Seven max triad.
Right.
The computer will do the rest.
Seven max triad.
Right.
Hey!
Hey, Frank, what are you doing up there?
What about the intercog?
Frank?
Jake, I'm ready to plug it in.
Right.
Go ahead.
It's in.
Okay.
Thought-project.
Seven max triad.
Okay, Frank.
Come on down.
Amazing.
I was afraid of that.
The focal terminal on the microtransformer's vaporized.
It happens in these older models.
You're sure?
Positive.
But I'll double-check.
Just what I thought.
That's where the focal terminal goes?
In that little thing?
Acts as a catalyzer.
I'll need a small amount of org 12.
What's org 12?
What the focal terminal's made of.
About six cubits ought to be enough for emergency repair.
You don't have org 12 on this planet?
Never heard of it.
Is it like mayonnaise?
You probably call it by a different name.
Now, stand back, Frank.
I'll run it through the computer.
Hey, Tom!
You all right?
Tom!
Org 12.
Ductile yellow metallic element.
Melting point, 1,063.
Tensile strength, 19,000.
Tensile strength what?
19,000.
Atomic weight, 196.967.
Wait a minute.
That's the atomic weight of gold!
Wow!
Out!
Out!
Everybody out!
What is that?
Come on, let's go.
Follow me!
Holy cow.
Give my collar room, Frank.
You can't zap the whole base.
Let's get out of here.
Over here!
Follow me!
Move out!
Watch it!
Hey!
Come back here!
Where are you going?
Hey, hey!
Come out of there.
You're under arrest!
Look out!
What is it?
Get it off of me!
Get it off!
Was anybody in there?
Back it out.
Back it out.
Look out.
Who's driving?
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!
Yes, sir?
What's going on here?
Who sounded that alarm?
I did, sir.
We have an intruder, and his cat.
Cat?
Cat?
Cat?
Yes, sir.
Here's his collar.
Jake!
Excuse me.
Jake, are you all right?
Frank, shut up and move this thing.
That's him, sir!
Halt!
Get that thing out of here!
Get it out!
Move it out!
Now what do we do?
Now you hang on.
17 times...
Five of...
Now cosine of...
Yeah...
Hey, Frank.
This is even better than the stuff I had last night.
What's it called?
Tuna.
Tuna?
Love it.
Keeps coming out the same way and it doesn't make any sense.
What doesn't?
Well, according to your figures,
We're going to need $120,000 worth of gold.
So?
So?
Jake, forgetting the money, which I can't forget,
You know how much gold that is?
It's that much.
And you want to put it in a space that big?
You folks are still operating on the bulk system as opposed to content.
I'll reduce it to the size I need.
And still retain all its properties.
How?
I'll get into that later.
First buy the gold.
Buy it?
Jake, in order to buy $120,000 worth of gold,
You need $120,000.
So?
Is that a problem?
A problem?
My entire capital is tied up in my next paycheck.
Then what's the alternative?
I don't know what the alternative is.
I...
Hi.
Traditionally known in horse racing...
Boy.
What are you doing?
Borrowing your tv.
Just bring me a beer and forget I'm here.
Hi, Jake.
Link...
Wife's worked out an equitable tv schedule for the day.
The Peachtree Derby and the football game's on your set,
And the metropolitan opera on mine.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Doing what?
Playing with your pussycat?
Link...
Franklin, please.
I've got a bundle bet on the Peachtree.
Frank, we've got problems to solve, things to do.
What?
Link, I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to ask you...
They're at the post.
You want a peanut?
No.
Come on, Sweet Jake.
Let's go.
Sweet Jake?
Yeah, it's a hunch bet.
100 on the nose at 15 to 1.
I tell you, if she comes in, tiger,
And I'm gonna be 1,500 in front,
And you'll be licking mackerel fillet.
Did you forget my beer or did I drink it already?
Never mind, I'll get it.
I'll try to get rid of him.
Wait a minute.
Did you hear what he said, Frank?
If Sweet Jake finishes first, he wins $1500.
So?
So if Link can win $1500,
Why can't we win 120,000?
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.
He just made a bet.
He could win 1500.
It doesn't mean he will.
With me on his side, he will.
Did you say something?
No, nothing.
Okay, okay.
Let's pipe down.
I got 100 big ones riding on this nag.
And they're off.
It's Denny's Doll breaking on top.
Attaboy Star.
Daddy's Poppa on the outside.
Booky Baby on the rail and Seabottom...
Where's Sweet Jake?
Sweet Jake is still in the gate.
At the clubhouse turn, it's Denny's Doll by half a length.
Attaboy Star, and Daddy's Poppa.
Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate.
Sweet Jake is moving.
He's way behind, but he's moving.
I think he stopped to have lunch.
I don't believe this.
Eat on your own time!
See what I mean?
Now, it's Attaboy Star...
Sweet Jake!
I should have bet on the Metropolitan Opera.
Daddy's Poppa moving up, and Seabottom.
It's Attaboy Star by a length.
Booky Baby, Denny's Doll and Seabottom.
Sweet Jake's finished eating and started running.
And, ladies and gentlemen, is he running!
But not even Silky Sullivan could come from this far behind.
It's Booky Baby taking the lead.
Daddy's Poppa moving into second, and Attaboy Star.
And making up incredible ground is Sweet Jake.
I have never seen anything like this.
But can he catch the pack?
At the top of the stretch.
It's Booky Baby in the lead.
Daddy's Poppa.
And turning for home, it's Sweet Jake.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Give him the whip, dummy.
Racetrack, and he's flying!
Attaboy!
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Jake.
Attaway.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Come on, boy!
That's it!
Hot dog money.
We got it!
Hoo!
Yee-haw!
The story here today, ladies and gentlemen, is Sweet Jake.
Never in...
Fifteen hundred smackeroos!
That calls for another beer.
How about you?
I'm buying.
No.
No, thanks.
Incidentally, Frank, you could use another six-pack.
I got a feeling I'm gonna murder them on the football games.
Frank, that's the solution to the money.
No, no, it's ridiculous.
It won't work.
Why won't it?
Well...
In the first place, I don't know anything about placing a bet.
I wouldn't know where to go, what to do.
I gotta call Ernie with my football bets.
The Rams, Patriot game starts in 25 minutes.
I guess we're gonna have to take in another partner.
Who?
Him.
Did you say something, Frank?
Link?
Do you think that's wise?
Do I think what's wise?
Who are you talking to?
Ask how many football games we can bet on.
But...
Who are you talking to?
Ask him!
Frank?
It's crazy.
Buddy?
What?
Who?
How many football games on tv today?
Three pro games.
East, midwest, far west.
Who?
Brief him.
Frank, have you got a tape machine going or something?
I don't think it's a good idea, but okay.
You know, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were talking to the cat.
I was.
Right.
Look, Frank, listen, this can happen to anybody in government service.
That's why they have staff psychiatrists.
First thing Monday...
Link, take a deep breath.
Okay.
Remember that artichoke?
Well, it all started when this spaceship...
Spaceship?
...
From another galaxy.
Landed in a field, out near Palmdale.
Frank, let me get this straight, okay?
Now, you're trying to tell me.
That your little pussycat came from another planet.
From another galaxy in a spacecraft,
And landed right here on Earth?
Is that what you're trying to say, Frank?
That's right.
You're squeezing, link.
See?
You heard him talk.
Look.
I mean, I don't know how you're doing your...
Your little trick, you know.
But I gotta tell you something, pal.
It's dumb.
Very dumb.
So, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna drink your last beer,
Then I'm gonna watch three football games on your television set,
And then I'm going home, because this is dumb, Frank.
Real dumb.
Now, that's dumb.
Aw, Link, look.
Listen to me for one minute.
I don't want to hear it, Frank.
He was trying to prove...
I don't want...
Something...
To hear it, Frank!
Okay?
Okay.
Thank you.
All right.
That does it, Frank!
I'm going home.
And watch the Metropolitan Opera.
Now, Link.
We need your help.
Jake needs your help!
I don't want to hear about it!
We need money to fix...
Frank, I...
You're the only person I know who knows how to place a bet.
I don't anything about placing...
What kind of a spaceship?
Hey, you're beautiful.
Well, you're down 200, sucker.
Would you like to double it?
Earnest Ernie's Sporting Club.
Weasel speaking.
What's your pleasure?
Yeah.
Give me four balls.
I'll double it.
What do you say, Sarasota Slim?
I say give him five.
The man says, "give him five." you got it.
Honest Harry holds.
Link, can you make it fast?
We got a hot one on the rotisserie.
Can I trust him?
Would a crook have a name like Honest Harry?
You wanna bet what?
Hold on.
Hey, Ernie.
Ernie, come here.
Yeah.
Ernie, it's Link.
He wants to take all his winnings from Sweet Jake.
And parlay the three football games.
You're kidding?
A three-game parlay?
Yeah.
It'll come to 120 g's if he makes it.
It's like taking candy from a baby, Weasel.
He's down.
You're down.
Hold it right there.
General?
General?
Fingerprints.
Fingerprints, sir.
They found fingerprints.
Well, now.
On top of the hull,
Inside the cabin, everywhere.
And they are the prints of a human being.
In other words, whatever power brought this ship here,
They were aided and abetted by some disloyal American.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with a collaborator.
I want the face that matches these prints.
Put it through the computer.
Double pronto, sir.
General!
General!
Look at this.
Sir, they found more.
What in blazes is that?
Fine hair, sir.
The pilot was wearing a fur coat.
But even more important, we found tiny prints.
In a claw-like pattern, like a...
Like a pussycat's.
Pussycat?
Why aren't I hearing some tickety-tacks?
What about those fingerprints?
There's a printout about to come through, sir.
Sir...
What do you want me to do with this?
Get it checked, sir.
Coming through, sir.
"I.D. Wilson, Frank.
Doctor.
"Social security, 631070829.
"1951 to '55.
US Navy.
'55 to '62, Caltech.
"Current employment, theoretician.
ERL"?
That's my Dr. Wilson!
The scoundrel.
We'll have him in the slammer within the hour, sir.
And blow the whole ball game?
Gentlemen, we're after Mr. Big,
And this double-crossing fink is gonna lead us to him.
To find the rat, tail the cat.
Cat?
It's just an expression.
Want a peanut, Jake?
No, thanks.
I'll wait till Frank gets back.
The Rams still ahead?
Ahead?
Frank, the Rams won the game.
And without Jake's help.
Without your help, buddy.
Great, let's break open the six-pack.
What will you have, Jake?
Did you get some more of that tuna?
Yeah, yeah.
Coming right up.
There's the two-minute warning.
Oilers leading 21-19, Houston driving.
Another one in the bag, Franklin.
Come in.
Frank?
Hi.
Lucybelle insisted on coming, too.
- Coming?
- Yeah, the picnic.
The picnic.
Beer, Liz?
No, thanks.
Is something wrong?
Is his croup worse?
Whose?
Jake's.
Yeah.
Right.
I was up all night.
Really?
Yeah.
It's gone into hyperzemia.
What's hyperzemia?
It's what Jake's got.
What did your doctor do for him yesterday?
He gave him two aspirin.
Two aspirin?
What's that?
What's happening, Frank?
I don't know.
Two aspirin.
No wonder you're feeling worse.
How did he get the ball?
Interception, I guess.
What this cat needs is some expert help.
Get him.
Dr. Wenger.
Get him.
Yeah, okay.
I'll go get him.
I'll be right back.
Get him.
Somebody tackle him.
Hi, sweetie.
Can I get you anything?
Okay.
Out of bounds on the 30.
Jake, why didn't you do something?
And spoil everybody's fun?
Look, guys, there's plenty of time.
Anybody ever tell you, you got a terrific set of whiskers?
Jake, for heaven's sakes, will you pay attention?
They're within field-goal range.
If they make it, we're sunk.
No problem, believe me.
A little tuna, sweetheart?
Jake, concentrate, please.
The next few seconds could be crucial.
Takes a time out.
Time out.
I appreciate it, doctor.
At least you could have waited till the game was over.
I have $10 on chicago.
You've got it on.
What's happening?
Time out.
This is Dr. Wenger.
Dr. Wenger, here's the patient.
I definitely think he needs your attention.
All right.
How did they get to the 30?
Interception.
Happened while we were in the elevator.
Or are they gonna try for a field goal?
What do you think, doctor?
I think they should try for a field goal.
About the cat.
Well, he's tense.
Yes, he's very tense.
The shoulder muscles are all bunched up.
Where do you wanna do the examination?
Right here will be fine.
Okay.
Let me get this out of the way.
Also, let's...
First thing, get this collar off.
Hey!
Good thinking, Chicago.
This year.
He's never missed inside the 35-yard line.
Get through that line now.
That guy can't kick a ball 60 yards.
Block that kick.
Block that kick.
Will you calm down now?
Hold the cat, please.
Jake, you better do something.
What are you doing?
Where's his collar?
Block that...
It's right here, Frank.
Give it to me, Liz.
Give it to me.
Frank, I'm just gonna hold the...
I'm gonna give him a sedative.
No, no, don't do that!
Frank, let go of the cat.
There's the snap.
It's down.
The kick is up.
It's long enough.
It's straight enough.
It's...
It's...
It's flat!
I've never seen anything like it.
We won!
The ball just flattened out in midair.
And there's the gun.
Jake?
The Oilers have won it 21 to 19.
I told you not to do that!
I only came up here as a favor to a neighbor.
As a rule, I do not make house calls.
You sure picked a dumb time to break your rule.
Dr. Link!
Look, Dr. Wenger, please forgive him.
He's a new cat-owner...
Jake.
Jake.
It's me, Jake.
Frank, we're finished.
He's blotto.
Well, look on the bright side.
San Diego could still win.
Yeah, and San Diego could still lose.
And where does that leave this poor little guy?
He's blown his rendezvous, and my 1500 clams.
That was very rude, Frank.
Liz, butt out.
What?
Cancel the bet.
Call Ernie.
He'll never buy it.
Look, what's going on here?
Jake, we got problems, Jake.
Speak to me.
Is everybody crazy?
Frank, the line is busy.
We'll never get through.
He's taking bets.
We'd better get down there.
Like yesterday.
Now, look...
Just a minute, Frank.
I would like...
No, I demand an explanation.
What's going on?
Later, Liz.
No.
Now.
Liz, we have got exactly six minutes before that game starts.
Watch it, Link.
I'm a black belt.
Okay.
We'll tell you in the elevator.
Remember that meeting we had with Dr. Heffel.
And General Stilton at the ERL?
Outer space?
Frank Wilson, are you putting me on?
No, no.
Remember that artichoke?
Well, yeah.
Dydee one calling Hopscotch.
Come in, Big Cheese.
This is Big Cheese.
Go ahead, Dydee One.
Do you still have contact with the subject?
Yes, sir.
Also that garbage expert.
And the dame from the car pool.
And they're all going into Earnest Ernie's pool hall.
Looks like a mafia tie-in, General.
Mafia?
What kind of an operation you running down there, Heffel?
Lucky!
Really lucky.
Ernie?
Ernie?
Excuse me.
Ernie?
Hi, Ernie.
Well, look who's here.
Hiya, doc.
Ernie,
I wanna cancel my Chargers bet.
You wanna cancel your Chargers bet?
Yeah, cancel my Chargers bet.
Really?
Why?
I don't know.
Just a hunch, sort of.
Hey, not a bad hunch.
The Chargers are 10 points behind.
Already?
16, boss, 16.
Steelers just scored another one.
Sorry, doc.
Is he taking a nap?
Yeah.
Is that tv picture still out?
Well, there goes 120,000.
1,500 of which is mine.
Isn't there anything you can do?
Not while Jake is out.
Jake, Jake, wake up.
We need you, Jake.
Frank, is he breathing?
He's snoring.
Okay.
Okay.
Isn't there anything else we can bet on?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe we could get lucky.
Another football game?
Next Sunday.
Basketball?
Tuesday night.
Hockey?
Hockey?
Hockey.
Ernie, Ernie, is there a hockey game today.
That we could put a few bucks on?
Sorry.
Horse race?
Boxing?
Demolition derby?
Anything to get even.
No.
But, hey, if you want a little action,
There's always my good friend Sarasota Slim.
Sarasota Slim?
Yes.
He indulges occasionally in a friendly pool game.
With a slight wager on the side.
Nothing doing.
Why not?
Well, he's a hustler.
Who isn't?
Okay, it's a bet.
Frank.
What are the odds?
You against Sarasota Slim?
Right.
Frank.
Well, because I want to give you a chance to break even.
And because I like your style,
Let's say 8 to 1.
That's all?
What about him?
Me?
Link?
Well, considering the shape he's in, I'd say maybe 10 to 1.
What about the lady?
Me?
Liz?
Considering the shape she's in, 20 to 1.
Okay, you got a bet.
Frank!
Arch, set 'em up.
Another sucker just swam into the net.
Frank, I don't know anything about this game.
Frank, are you bananas?
That guy can make a pool ball sit up and do the boogaloo.
I know, but I've got the equalizer...
The collar.
How are you gonna do that?
Jake's out.
I've used it to repair the spaceship.
You?
Yes.
I've flown and everything.
Charlie, give me the special, and heavy on the onions.
Taking a nap?
Yeah.
Throw in a few chili peppers?
Frank, I don't want to take the risk...
Liz, you've got to do it.
I'm desperate.
No money, no gold.
No gold, no liftoff.
But...
But if we deliver, look what we get in return.
The solution to half the problems on this planet.
Just show me how to hold the pole.
Good girl.
Now, we need a stake.
I've got about 12 bucks.
It's in my hip pocket.
Will you get it for me?
Yeah, okay, that's 12.
Now, how much do you have?
Me?
I think I got 20.
20?
Liz?
I just have my mad money.
Give it to us, please?
Come on.
Boy, when this dame gets mad, she gets mad.
I was going to buy a whole spring wardrobe, Link.
Okay.
Ernie.
Boss, here's the bankroll.
Ernie, we bet 300 at 20 to 1.
Check.
Not in your lifetime, Ernie.
Honest Harry holds.
All right, you want Honest Harry, you got Honest Harry.
300 at 20 to 1.
That's 6,000 clams.
And here's our 300.
Earnest ernie, 6,000.
The mark, 300.
6,300.
And may the best man win.
Or woman, as the case may be.
Young lady, it's your break.
Come on, Charlie, don't be so stingy with the onions.
Here, take the collar, Liz.
Okay, here.
Link, keep your eye on him.
If he blinks just once...
Miss?
Do you mind?
We're waiting.
Now, that's a sandwich.
Right?
Right.
Taking a nap.
Naturally.
Nice break, young lady.
Very nice.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink anything,
But there's always tomorrow.
Show her how to do it.
Okay, Slim, go get her.
I can't watch this.
Frank, I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's not your fault.
Attaway, Slim.
Attaway, baby.
I guess we are licked.
If only Jake hadn't got knocked out...
Frank!
Frank, look.
Jake!
Jake?
Frank, he must have just woke up.
Jake, are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Where am I?
What happened?
I'm Liz Bartlett.
I'm responsible for your being...
Liz, Liz.
Well.
Jake, we have got to win this pool game.
That's money in the bank.
Look at it!
Honest Harry, guess who's here?
Ernie?
Here's our last 60 bucks.
What are the odds now?
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.
No bet.
No bet?
It's part of my code of ethics.
Always leave the sucker rent money.
That's not fair!
Honest Harry?
If the mark wants to go complete top city,
He's got a constitutional right.
And I stand on it.
The odds, Ernie?
It's ridiculous.
But if I didn't have no principles,
I'd say 100 to 1.
Suppose...
Suppose she gives Sarasota Slim 12 balls?
What a sense of humor!
300 to 1.
And the break.
The break?
500 to 1.
And blindfolded.
What?
Blindfolded!
2,000 to 1.
You're on.
$60 at 2,000 to 1.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Are you seriously serious?
You're not thinking of welching, are you?
But I thought you was putting me on.
Earnest Ernie, it would not do your reputation any credit.
If word was to circulate that you reneged.
On a wager duly offered and accepted.
Get the big bundle, Weasel.
But, boss, that's a...
Get it!
All right.
Let me understand this.
Slim gets 12 balls and the break?
And she shoots blindfolded.
She'll never get to the table.
120 g's, boss.
Don't put it away, Honest Harry, you ain't gonna hold it long.
All right, Slim.
Show 'em no mercy.
Nice.
Nice break, slim.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink nothing, but there's always tomorrow.
I believe I'm up.
Hold it.
Blindfolded.
Could you back off?
Thank you.
It was nothing.
You did it, Jake.
You did it.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It was really nothing.
Thank you.
Frank, we won!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, all of you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about things being upside down, Mr. Olympus,
But I took these pictures at risk of life and limb.
There's the cat, sir.
Notice his collar?
Well, well.
What did you think of it, Mr. Olympus?
It's just mind-boggling, isn't it?
I mean, it boggled my mind.
Did it boggle yours, sir?
Thank you, Omar.
Yes, Mr. Stallwood, you are quite correct.
It is "mind-boggling," as you so graphically put it.
The possibilities are infinite.
A revolution in transportation, space exploration,
Colonizing the planets.
The man who owns the secret of this device could control...
The world, sir?
The universe.
My!
Well, then, sir, I don't suppose it would be.
Out of place to suggest a bonus.
A bonus?
A small bonus.
Mr. Stallwood, if I gain the secret of that device,
You may well become a very rich man.
I may?
Sir, I...
Really may?
Omar, prepare the copter.
We leave at once.
I must have that collar.
I will have that collar.
Okay.
All set, General.
Is it fully programmed?
All the pertinent information fed in.
Everything we know.
Question number one, sir.
Question number one.
Who is the pilot?
It is a pussycat!
This machine is having a nervous breakdown.
Get on the ball, young man.
Feed that information through again.
Reassess.
Yes, sir.
General Stilton, sir.
What is it, Sergeant?
That purchase Dr. Link made this afternoon, we checked it out.
It's a large quantity of gold.
Gold?
Yes, sir.
It's a Machiavellian conspiracy.
Radio.
This is Big Cheese calling Dydee One.
Where are you, Dydee One?
Outside the suspect's apartment.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Another printout, General.
Of all the...
Wait a minute.
Radio.
Dydee One.
Yes, sir.
Didn't they carry a cat into that pool hall?
Yes, sir, they did.
Gentlemen, it's time to move in.
Colonel.
Captain.
$120,000 in one lump sum.
Jake, how'd you like to hang around for a few days.
And watch me parlay this into a fortune?
I wish I could hang around.
I'm sorry, Jake.
The time?
Yeah.
Sorry, Lucy.
Well, I guess I'd better reduce the gold.
Reduce it?
What are you talking about?
It's a whole new concept in calculating mass.
You see, on Jake's planet, they use a system based on content,
Rather than on the quantitative scale...
Frank!
You've got a whole lifetime to explain that.
I've got less than an hour.
Now, stand back, everybody.
All right, don't move!
All hands in the air!
In the air!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Dr. Frank Wilson?
What is this?
You can't butt in here!
Dr. Frank Wilson, you are under arrest.
And the pussycat, General.
And the pussycat.
Read them their rights, Colonel.
Captain?
Sergeant?
You have the right to remain silent.
Never mind.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right...
Good heavens.
Frank...
What happened?
They're frozen.
Holy mackerel!
Well, now that they're on to us, how are we gonna get into Hopscotch?
You can't zap the whole base.
Yeah, well, I'll think of something.
They've probably got the whole place on alert.
First things first, Frank.
Let's get this gold reduced, then we'll worry about getting on the base.
Now stand back.
Okay.
Here goes.
That is unbelievable.
Jake.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think I've got the perfect way to get us onto the base.
Maybe we ought to give 'em a buzz.
Think we ought to give 'em a buzz?
Yeah, give 'em a buzz.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
What's the military doing here?
This could be complicated, sir.
What isn't?
Get that door closed!
What does it all mean?
It means it's exceptionally complicated.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Here comes General Cheese.
I mean, Stilton.
Wait a minute.
Here.
Hold Jake for a minute.
Yes.
How do I look?
Could you hold lucy for a minute?
Do I look like a General?
Well...
Frank, you look very commanding.
That'll have to do.
Let's go.
Okay.
He got the cat.
That's the cat!
Where's the General going with those two?
That's the General?
It's not?
Open your door!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Halt!
Halt in the name of the us...
Fantastic.
Listen, good luck?
Yeah, be careful.
Bye, Lucybelle.
Thanks for everything.
Yeah, yeah.
Let's go.
Bye.
They've escaped?
Yes.
But, fortunately for us, they left something very valuable behind.
General Stilton?
Of course!
Of course.
I'll sign you in, sir.
General Stilton and cat.
Is the cat cleared, sir?
What do you think?
Sorry, sir.
I want the hangar open and all personnel out.
We're moving the ship.
But, sir, if we order 'em out of the hangar, how are you gonna...
Soldier!
Out of the hangar, sir.
Yes, sir.
Get the hangar doors open.
All personnel out of the hangar on the double.
First, let's get the ship out of the hangar.
Check.
To talk to a lawyer and have him present while you're being...
Colonel?
Yes, sir.
Hold it right here, Frank.
130 to countdown.
Hurry.
Insert the gold in the microtransformer.
Right, right.
Got it.
Good.
Now let's see if we have contact.
Zunar-J-5 calling mother ship.
Come in, mother.
Where's the microphone?
How do you transmit?
Frank!
Okay, okay!
Zunar-J-5 calling mother ship.
Come in, mother.
Hi, there, fella.
See you made it with nothing to spare.
We had problems.
We are 105 to liftoff.
Coming in on ray 0392.
Adjust transmuter.
Adjustment made.
- Countdown starts at 20.
- Set clinometers.
Clinometers' set.
Give me a printout, please.
Coming your way without delay.
That's another cat?
Yeah.
A real mother.
I gotta get to that spaceship right away.
Sir, who are you?
A friend of Frank...
I mean General Stilton.
A very good friend.
Let's go.
Open the gate.
My car!
Them, too.
Never mind them.
Let's get down to Hopscotch.
Sergeant.
Captain.
Colonel.
General.
Get in!
Counting down.
Hey, Frank!
Hold it, sir, right there.
General, this man says...
Hey!
You're not General Stilton.
Hey, Frank.
Link!
What are you doing here?
Frank, it's a nightmare.
Liz has been captured by stallwood.
What...
Have you been hitting the beer?
Stallwood of supplies and purchasing?
He's an agent, Frank.
For some guy named Olympus,
A power-crazed creep who's trying to...
Frank, he's holding her for ransom.
Lucybelle, too?
Yeah, he wants that collar, Jake.
It's the collar or Liz.
Are they out of their minds?
Where is she?
I'm going with you, Frank.
No, no, no, you don't want to get stuck here on Earth.
And you've got a responsibility to your mission.
But I'm the reason for the mess they're in.
Do you know where they're taking her?
Yeah.
To some place called Dailey's airport.
Do you know where it is?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Frank...
Jake, you're going home.
Now, get in there.
So long, buddy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Five, four,
Three, two.
Ignite.
Bye, Jake.
Drop us a card.
Okay, you clowns.
Let's move it.
Let's go.
Jake!
Jake, this is insane.
You're here forever, on Earth.
You're wasting time.
The airport!
General, look!
Good heavens!
That's my car.
Get the police on the radio.
Hello, Sequoia...
Turn this thing around!
Here comes a car.
It's Wilson.
Yeah, and Link.
And the cat!
They're here.
They've come!
Naturally.
You knew they would.
You knew it.
We've won.
Now they will have turn over the cat.
And we will turn over the girl.
We will?
We won't?
It might be difficult to explain your part in this affair.
After the young lady's gone to the police.
Dear.
You wouldn't dare!
Frank, that must be the chopper.
It's the police, sir.
It's a trap.
The fools!
Get us airborne.
Watch it!
They're getting away!
They're leaving!
Yeah, yeah.
But look who's arriving.
The army and the police.
Jake, we have to follow that copter.
What...
What kind of an airport is this?
Where are the planes?
Follow me.
You can't fly this, Jake.
It's a wreck.
Look at that propeller, it's half gone.
Are you coming or staying?
I'm coming.
I'm staying.
Okay, Tovarisch.
Quoi?
All right,
Dr. Garbage Expert.
Who's your accomplice?
Who's flying that plane?
General, you're not gonna believe this.
There they are.
It's Wilson and the cat.
How did they get that wreck in the air?
The power that cat possesses is awesome.
You betcha, Charlie,
And if you know what's good for you,
You'll land this thing, and let Lucybelle...
Quiet!
Okay.
Faster, Omar, faster.
Get close.
Use the collar to force them to land.
No chance.
It's taking all I got.
Just to keep this crate flying.
Don't panic.
We'll think of something.
What's happening?
Why aren't they doing something?
Of course!
They're afraid of harming the girl.
Turn on them, Omar.
The advantage is ours.
What's happening?
Why are they turning around?
Straight at them, Omar.
Drive them down.
Frank!
Jake!
Jake.
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Turn this thing over.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake.
Jake!
Frank, are you okay?
What are they trying to do?
They're trying to force us down.
They probably figured out that we've got a problem.
Hold on!
Here they come.
They're still on our tail.
Don't panic.
On top of them, Omar.
Smash them down!
I see 'em.
I see 'em.
Look out.
Jake!
Jake!
Here they come again.
Jake!
Yeah, yeah.
Fruitcake.
Frank, watch out!
Jake, Jake!
Boy.
Jake.
Dear.
Jake!
Break off!
Buzz them again, Omar, and this time, everybody open fire.
What happened?
You happened, you imbecile!
How bad is it, Omar?
He got the controls.
They're locked.
When the fuel runs out, we're through.
Shall we bail out, sir?
We have no choice.
Bail out?
Where are you going?
I haven't got a parachute.
Then you have a problem.
I haven't got a parachute, either.
Then you have the same problem.
Wait!
No, wait!
Wait a minute!
I...
I don't want to die!
Swell.
Frank!
Frank!
Yes, Mr. President.
Absolutely, Mr. President.
We're just waiting for them to land and we'll pass that on, Mr. President.
Yes, sir.
What'd he say?
Your friend, Jake is to be treated as the representative of a friendly power,
With generous borrowing credit.
In exchange for bases, of course.
Look, sir, chutes.
They bailed out.
Holy mackerel!
Who's flying the chopper?
Frank!
Easy, Liz.
Don't panic.
What are you gonna do, Frank?
I don't know, but I have to do something.
Hand me Lucybelle!
Careful, Frank!
I got her.
Just hold on, honey, and we'll get Liz.
Get us up closer to the copter.
Right.
Liz, when we get close enough, grab my hand.
Frank, you're too far away!
Closer, Jake.
Closer!
Okay.
All right.
Grab my hand, liz.
Grab it!
Grab it!
Liz, careful.
Okay.
Now grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
All right.
I'm...
Yeah.
Good.
That's good.
That's good.
Now grab my hand and step off.
Step off?
Liz!
Frank, I don't think this is gonna work.
All right.
We'll try it again.
Never mind.
We'll try something else.
All right, put your feet on my shoulders.
What?
Put your feet right there, on my shoulders.
No!
Liz, do it!
Okay.
Okay.
You see?
Everything's gonna be okay, Lucybelle.
Just relax.
Jake!
Jake, what are you doing?
You know, when I saw you up in that chopper, I just...
Well, honey, looks like you're stuck with me.
Don't just hang there.
Get me out of this.
Don't worry, Mr. Olympus.
I'll get you loose.
What are you doing with that?
Well, fortunately, I never go anywhere without my swiss army knife.
Idiot!
All rise.
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

What is it?
What is that light?
I don't know.
(banging)
You stay right here, Edna.
Don't leave the house.
I'm gonna take a look at it.
Come on, Dutch.

Come in.
Mother Ship.
This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
(female voice) This is Mother Ship.
Have you completed emergency landing?
Affirmative.
Mother.
Request repair party.
Negative.
Zunar J5.
You'll have to effect emergency repairs yourself.
and rendezvous with us at grid dissect 8304 at 69 hours minus 17.
- That's an awfully tight squeeze.
- Unavoidable.
Zunar.
Next mission to this galaxy due in 115.
- Days?
- Years.
Good luck.
Zunar J5.
Over and out.
Yeah.
So long.
Mother.
(whistles)
I don't see any hammer and sickle, do you, Colonel?
Maybe it's on the inside, General.
No sign of life, either.
Get me the Pentagon, red priority.
I want to speak to the chiefs, Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Sequoia here.
Come in, Rover.
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
(General) Wipe it out of your minds.
You've seen nothing and heard nothing.
- Yes, sir.
- We'll want them later.
Take their names.
Colonel.
Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Names?
- Charlie Cooney.
General Stilton!
We're ready when you are, sir.
- Bullhorn.
- Yes, sir.
On to Hopscotch.
All right, men.
Let's move it!
- Let's move out.
Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
(electronic beeping)
(collar beeps)
(General) When we get to Hopscotch, I want mark-four priority security.
Armor, personnel, guard dogs, the works.
And not one word to public relations.
Not one word.
You got that, Colonel?
Yes, sir.
You got that, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
Sergeant?
- Got it.
Well?
It's a brilliant technological achievement.
It's state of the art.
You trying to tell me something, Allison?
- It's definitely not one of ours, General.
- How about Russia?
Certainly not Russia.
It's far beyond...
OK, Allison.
Lay it on the line.
Whose is it?
I don't know, General.
We'd better find out. i wanna know who made it, flew it and where it came from.
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Contact SigCom on our radio.
Get Hungerford at Air.
Call Steinmetz at Johns Hopkins, Lasser, Billings, Cranhammer.
- Get them IQs off their tennis courts.
- Yes, sir.
Double pronto!
If we don't find out where that thing came from, this country could be in trouble, big, big trouble.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
You say it's not man-made, Allison.
What's that leave us?
Outer space.
With no sign of the pilot.
Big, big trouble.
While you and I are talking this very minute, some slimy green-headed 12-legged creep could be crawling into the White House.
Big, big trouble.
We're up against genius.
We'd better come up with some genius of our own.
(man) I believe, General, you've already met my assistant, Dr. Corday.
I'd like to introduce some members of our team.
Dr. Robeson of Caltech, who's our expert on fossil fuel.
Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins.
Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett, who heads Thermal.
Huh.
Dr. Norman Link, who's been doing some intriguing work in garbage research.
- So what?
- Dr. Link.
Just a second, Dr. Heffel. I have to relay some vital information to a colleague.
Oh, yes.
This is our hard-water man, Dr. Leach.
Right, Ernie.
The Lakers by a point and a half for 100 bucks.
When will you have the line on Philly and the New York Knicks?
(Heffel) I'd like you to meet Mr. Jurist, who also is involved in Thermal.
And there's Dr. Banford, Professor Epstein, Doctors Davidson and Barrett.
And, of course, this is Dr. Humphrey, our head of Nuclear.
Mr. Stallwood, our head of Procurement and Supplies.
What are you doing here?
When the call went out for an emergency meeting, I naturally assumed...
You assumed wrong.
Scientists.
Double-A clearance only.
Out.
- But I might have a contribution.
- lf we need any pencils, I'll send for you.
- But, Dr. Heffel...
- Out.
Sorry, General.
Where was I?
Oh, yes.
Professor...
Dr. Heffel, I didn't come for a roll call, I came to pick brains.
Are they all here?
- Yes.
These are our top people.
- Then let's get to it!
I understand, General.
Attention, everyone.
(Heffel) Dr. Link.
That's it, Professor.
I'll call tomorrow with more input.
Bye.
All right, Sergeant.
Open it.
Drapes.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is top secret.
The United States government will countenance no leaks.
Now.
What's holding it up?
- Nothing.
- It's amazing.
- Where did you get it?
- What is it?
(man) A propulsion unit of some sort, ladies and gentlemen.
Never mind where we got it.
We have other experts working on that.
What we want to know from you is, what makes it tick?
OK.
Let's have your hypothesis.
Uh, the energy source could be atomic.
We've checked on that.
Negative.
Direct conversion, utilizing thermionic...
- Checked out.
Negative.
- Oh.
It's not propelled by garbage, I know that.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Come in, Olympus.
Mr. Olympus?
This is Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something very big and very...
Jellyfish.
Your man in ERL?
Yes, sir.
That Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something.
No, sir. I think you'll find this a great deal more interesting than my last report.
Right now, Dr. Heffel is in a secret meeting with a four-star general and a whole gaggle of scientists.
What are they meeting about?
I don't know, sir, it's a secret.
Get in there and find out?
Do any of you have a solid evaluation?
Not a guess, a solid premise?
Do you?
Well?
(clears throat)
Do you think it might be fruitful to bring Dr. Wilson into this discussion, Dr. Heffel?
- Wilson?
- Yes.
He might very well come up with an applicable theory.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Who's Dr. Wilson?
- He's in my carpool.
Oh...
That is, we live in the same building.
- That certainly qualifies him.
- Oh.
No.
What I'm trying to say is, he's a very bright young physicist who's come here recently on loan from Caltech.
A loan, I might add, that is bearing absolutely no interest.
(laughter)
He's a little unorthodox, but a brilliant theorist.
- General Stilton isn't interested in...
- Get him.
- What?
- Get him.
His output couldn't be any less than what we've gotten so far.
Yes, General.
He really has an unusual mind.
- Well, Dr. Wilson?
- It's beautiful.
Don't you have any other observation?
- Only that it looks like an artichoke.
- We know it looks like an artichoke.
What makes it tick?
Mayonnaise?
Negative.
No, I was only joking, sir.
I do have a theory, sir, actually, in line with the work I've been doing.
I have a hunch it's tapping the primal mainstream.
The primal mainstream?
It's everywhere, only on different frequencies.
The whole electromagnetic spectrum -
Cosmic, gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, radio waves.
Do you know how much we finite human beings can tune into with our senses?
Less than five percent.
The universe makes its own energy.
We even make it ourselves.
Yes, take biofeedback, for instance.
If I taped terminals to your head, General, your brain could run an electric train.
- Electric train?
- (Heffel) I'm sorry, General.
Perhaps electric train wasn't the most apt example.
(Heffel) Thank you very much.
- Let me have that for a couple of months...
- Thank you.
A couple of months?
Dr. Heffel?
- Yes, General?
- l want action.
(bell rings)
You know, Drexel, I've seen the most amazing thing.
Amazing.
But don't ask me to tell you about it.
It's classified.
(bell rings)
Thank you, Drexel.
Well.
How did you get in here?
Huh?
Now look, you're asking for trouble.
Dr. Heffel isn't too crazy about animals in the building.
Fact is, he isn't too crazy about people in the building either.
What's your name, huh?
Charlie?
Cuddles?
Jake?
Yes, yes.
You look like Jake.
That, Jake, is the Van Allen belt.
Oil and coal is not going to do it, you know.
And, one of these days, that sun of ours is going to turn into a big black hole.
You know where it's really at, Jake?
Electromagnetism.
We're loaded with it.
You know, it's crazy, but you almost look like you know what I'm talking about.
All right, give me a hand with this, Sergeant.
Easy, easy.
That's it.
Stallwood, administration emergency!
That's some fancy collar you got there.
Maybe I'll take you home with me.
My neighbor Liz has a cat named Lucybelle.
She's really cute.
And the cat's not bad either.
Liz!
Hi.
Ouch!
I've...
- We were just talking about you.
- Were you?
This is Jake.
I'm going to take him home with us.
You won't have to drive Professor Link and myself home tonight.
- Heffel's called a late meeting.
- l can wait.
That won't be necessary.
- How about a coffee?
- No.
- Chocolate chip cookie?
- No.
- Are you sore or something?
- Sore?
Sore?
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- What is it?
What did I do?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Mayonnaise?
Electric trains?
Well, now, look, really, all that...
that was just a joke, Doctor.
Well, nobody laughed, especially the general.
Has he had water?
- The general?
- The cat.
Oh.
Water?
Cats do get thirsty, you know.
Do you have a bowl?
A bowl?
Right here, yes.
Here.
- Water?
- Yes, right, water.
Look, Liz...
Dr. Bartlett.
Just because some general lacks a sense of humor, that's no reason...
- All I was trying to convey...
- I'm really not interested, Doctor.
Besides, I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's just that the magnitude of what the general showed us just bowled me over.
- it did?
- Oh, completely.
- Black.
- What?
- Didn't you offer me a cup of coffee?
- Right.
Check.
Coming right up.
I really don't understand, that's all.
The man who wrote the article you did for The Scientific Quarterly...
- You read it?
- Well, of course. it was brilliant.
I've been wanting to tell you.
We don't get much chance to talk in the car pool, but I've been following your work.
- You have?
- Closely.
It's very impressive, very innovative, very attractive.
I mean, it's bound to attract attention.
Oh, well, um, I am writing an article at the moment and I would love to have your criticism.
Oh.
Maybe at lunch or, even better, at dinner sometime?
- Yeah, I'd like that.
When?
- Tonight?
No, that's right, you've got that late meeting.
That may not go all that late.
I should be out by seven.
Is that too late?
- Seven's beautiful.
- Good.
Well...
Oh, thanks for the coffee.
it was delicious.
- l think she digs you.
- l sure hope so.
- Who said that?
- l did.
Frank, we'd better get down to business.
Sit down.
We've gotta talk.
I'm running out of time, and you're the only one I can depend on to help me.
- It's you?
- It's not the mouse.
Now, sit down.
But your lips aren't moving.
You're not speaking.
Thought transference.
Nothing exceptional where l come from.
Now, sit.
My name is Zunar J5/9 Doric 4-7.
Zunar...?
Why don't we just stay with Jake, OK?
Frank, last night at 03 hours plus 13, I made an emergency landing in a spaceship from another galaxy.
That so-called artichoke...
it's from my craft.
But... you're a cat.
Granted.
But you see, in our civilization, that's as far as we needed to evolve.
We developed our brain to a fine point.
Now, man rose off his four legs and developed tools, machinery, agriculture and a chronic pain in his lower back.
We developed tools for the mind.
This collar here, it amplifies brain power.
- it does what?
- Well, it provides energy by which we...
Look, let me give you a demonstration.
(cello music)
- (flute plays)
- Not a bad little tune.
(humming along)
Mm-mmm.
Frank, this is really delicious.
What is it?
Oh, it's chopped kidney.
It's all they had at the deli.
it really hits the spot.
I'm gonna take a couple of cases for my trip back.
Sure beats the blah I've been eating.
Well, now back to my problem.
Frank, I need an answer.
- What do you say?
- Say about what?
Can I count on you to help me repair my spaceship?
- Why me?
- Because I like the way you think.
Your equations rather interest me.
In fact, they're really not bad at all... for a human.
- Really?
I'm on the right track?
- Quite definitely, but years away from a solution.
Frank, on my planet, we have an expression - you rub my fur, I'll rub yours.
How would you like to make a quantum jump?
You help me, and I'll give you a push in the right direction.
- You're serious?
- I'm serious.
- You really are from outer space?
- l am from outer space.
- Even though you're a cat?
- Frank!
Is it a deal?
It's a deal.
Oh, that's...
We better move.
I've got to make repairs to my ship by 5:13 Sunday for liftoff, or I'll miss the rendezvous with the mother ship.
Right.
I'll get my sweater.
Uh, do you think that you can find your way back to that airport?
No problem.
I made a memory imprint.
- With the collar?
- Right.
Fantastic.
How developed does your brain have to be to use that collar?
Not very.
In fact, you could handle it.
You wanna try?
Do we have time?
Why not?
Look, just grab hold of it.
Easy.
Don't take it off.
Without it, I'm just an average cat.
Right.
- Right.
OK?
- OK.
- Now just concentrate.
- Concentrate.
Think levitation.
Levitation.
You're as light as a feather.
Look at me.
I'm floating!
It's just plain incredible!
- Look, one hand.
- You're losing your concentration.
Yeah.
Hi, Frank.
Gotta use your set.
(commentator) The ball goes crosscourt to Brown.
He brings it...
- What were you doing up in the air?
- Uh...
- Astronaut exercises.
- Oh.
- Link, I'm busy.
- Yeah.
Well, just forget I'm here.
The last minute of the game, and Francine throws me out of the apartment.
Why does she throw me out?
For one lousy cigar burn on the chair.
- When did you get a cat?
- Jake's not my cat.
He's just visiting.
- Hi, Jake.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Do you mind, Frank?
Remember. the score's tied at 108.
Atlanta has the ball and a basket could win it.
Win it?
Oh, man!
And I gave a point and a half.
There goes my 100 bucks.
Come on, defense.
Come on, guys.
Man to man, we'll...
The crowd is really on its feet now.
The guy in the corner.
He's alone and closely guarded by King.
King steals the ball.
What a play.
Here come the Lakers.
Five seconds left.
Puts up a shot.
But a prayer. there's no chance.
Wait...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
I don't believe it.
He scores!
He made it in the last second.
and the Lakers will win it by two.
Unbelievable!
Frank, did you see that?
Yeah.
I'm really gonna have to ask you to leave.
- l could use another beer.
- I'm out of beer, I'm sorry.
- How about a ginger ale?
- I'm out of that, too.
- Could I at least finish my cigar?
- Link, please.
I'd like to have a little celebration.
I'll see you later.
The basketball game?
You did that?
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
it was the fastest way to get rid of that flake.
Let's go.
It's less than 36 hours to liftoff.
Right.
Oh...
Do you think I ought to carry you, so people don't suspect you're not an ordinary cat?
Good thinking, Frank.
Besides, my left paw's been acting up again.
- An old football injury?
- Actually, no.
Polo.
Now let's go.
What about getting into Hopscotch?
It'll be guarded.
- I'll handle that, too.
- It's fantastic.
Hi.
Hi, this is Lucybelle.
What'd you say you call him?
- Jake.
- Jake, right.
Jake, this is Lucybelle.
I thought they could get acquainted while we're at dinner.
- At dinner?
- Yeah.
it was tonight, wasn't it?
Right.
Right, yes.
I was just about to call you.
Something came up.
I'm afraid you're going to have to give me a rain check.
Oh.
Oh, well, of course.
it really doesn't matter.
But it does.
it matters a lot, Liz.
Dr. Bartlett.
You see, what happened was... (Jake sneezing)
It's Jake.
He took sick.
Suddenly.
Out of the blue.
Really?
What is it?
I think it's, uh, Tasmanian Croup.
(sneezing)
You poor thing.
You know, he sounds terrible.
You'd better not let her get too close.
Stop milking it.
- What?
- l said I was about to rush him to the vet's.
The vet.
That's a good idea, Frank.
D'you know there's a very good vet who lives in the building?
A Dr. Wenger.
He specializes in cats.
I'm sure he'd be glad to take a look at him.
Jake prefers a general practitioner.
I'm sorry about dinner.
I'll make it up to you.
- How about a picnic?
- Tomorrow?
- You handled that very well.
- l didn't enjoy lying to Liz.
She's a very unusual person.
- Her kitty-cat's not too bad either.
- There's plenty of time for that.
That's all right for you to say.
But I've been confined to a spaceship for five months.
Ohh... (vehicle approaches)
- (Jake) The ship's in that big hangar.
- Oh.
There's got to be a way in.
- It's locked.
- No problem.
- Come on, come on.
- Right, right.
The coast is clear.
Let's go!
There she is.
Somebody's coming.
- Somebody's coming, Frank!
- l know, I know.
What's happening?
It's all clear.
- Let's go!
- It's this way.
(dog growls)
(barks)
Forget it. it wears off in 20 minutes.
He won't remember a thing.
Come on, let's go.
Incredible.
An older model, but in pretty good shape for a rig with nearly a trillion miles on it.
Now let's see about getting it operational again.
We've only got 34 hours left.
Right.
Through here?
Hm-hm.
Put me down.
Oh, it's just incredible.
The artichoke.
I was right.
- What's this... control panel?
- Uh-huh.
Sort of.
- And this?
- Uh, computer.
- Then this must be the readout.
- Frank, later.
I'll explain it all later, I promise.
- First, disengage the transducer system.
- How?
Take that neo-mag intercog, and you'll find the transducer switch on top of the ship.
Just coordinate with me.
Well, how do I get up there?
- Fly.
- Fly?
You mean use your collar?
Don't be ridiculous.
We carry a spare.
Concentrate, and when you get on top, engage the switch with the intercog and thought-project "seven max triad."
- Seven max triad.
- Right.
The computer will do the rest.
Seven max triad.
Right.
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hey, Frank, what are you doing up there?
What about the intercog?
Frank?
Jake, I'm ready to plug it in.
Right.
Go ahead.
- It's in.
- OK.
Thought-project.
Seven max triad.
OK, Frank.
Come on down.
Amazing.
I was afraid of that.
The focal terminal on the microtransformer's vaporized.
- You're sure?
- Positive.
But I'll double-check.
- Just what I thought.
- That's where the focal terminal goes?
Acts as a catalyzer.
I'll need a small amount of org 12.
- What's org 12?
- What the focal terminal's made of.
About six cubits ought to be enough.
You don't have org 12 on this planet?
Never heard of it.
Is it like mayonnaise?
You probably call it by a different name.
Stand back.
I'll run it through the computer.
(horn honks)
Hey, Tom!
You all right?
Tom!
Org 12...
ductile yellow metallic element.
Melting point - 1.063.
Tensile strength - 19.000.
- Tensile strength what?
- 19.000.
Atomic weight - 196.967.
Wait a minute.
That's the atomic weight of gold.
Wow!
(alarm blaring. bell ringing)
(soldier) Out!
Out!
Everybody out!
What is that?
Come on, let's go.
Follow me!
Holy cow.
- Give my collar room.
- You can't zap the whole base.
Let's get out of here.
Over here!
Follow me!
Move out!
Watch it!
Come back here!
(Jake) Where are you going?
Come out of there.
You're under arrest!
Look out!
- (meowing)
- What is it?
Get it off of me!
Get it off!
(soldier) Was anybody in there?
Back it out.
Look out.
Who's driving?
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!
- Yes, sir?
- Who sounded that alarm?
I did, sir.
We have an intruder, and his cat.
Cat?
Cat?
Cat?
Yes, sir.
Here's his collar.
Jake!
Excuse me.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Frank, shut up and move this thing.
- That's him, sir!
- Halt!
Get that thing out of here!
Get it out!
Move it out!
Whoa!
- Now what do we do?
- Now you hang on.
(Frank) 17 times...
Um, five of...
Now cosine of...
Yeah.
Uh...
This is even better than the stuff I had last night.
What's it called?
- Tuna.
- Tuna?
Love it.
- it doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?
According to your figures, we're going to need $120,000 worth of gold.
- So?
- So?
Jake, forgetting the money, which I can't forget, you know how much gold that is?
It's that much.
And you want to put it in a space that big?
You folks are still operating on the bulk system.
I'll reduce it to the size I need and still retain all its properties.
- How?
- I'll get into that later.
First buy the gold.
Buy it?
Jake, in order to buy $120,000's worth of gold, you need $120,000.
- So?
Is that a problem?
- A prob...?
My entire capital is tied up in my next paycheck.
- Then what's the alternative?
- l don't know what...
Hi.
- Traditionally known in horse racing...
- Oh, boy.
- What are you doing?
- Borrowing your TV.
Just bring me a beer and forget I'm here.
Hi, Jake.
Link...
Wife's worked out an equitable TV schedule.
The Peachtree Derby and the football game's on your set, and the opera on mine.
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Doing what... playing with your pussycat?
- Link...
- Franklin, please.
I've got a bundle bet on the Peachtree.
(softly) We've got problems to solve, things to do.
What?
- Link, I'm gonna have to ask you...
- Sshh!
They're at the post.
You want a peanut?
No.
- Come on, Sweet Jake.
Let's go.
- Sweet Jake?
Yeah.
It's a hunch bet.
100 on the nose at 15 to 1.
I tell you, if she comes in, tiger, and I'm gonna be 1500 in front, and you'll be licking mackerel fillet.
Did you forget my beer or did I drink it already?
Never mind, I'll get it.
- I'll try to get rid of him.
- (softly) Wait a minute.
Did you hear what he said?
If Sweet Jake finishes first, he wins $1500.
- So?
- So if Link can win $1500, why can't we win 120,000?
No.
Wait a minute.
He just made a bet.
He could win 1500. it doesn't mean he will.
With me on his side, he will.
- Did you say something?
- Hmm?
No, nothing.
OK, OK.
Let's pipe down.
I got 100 big ones riding on this nag.
And they're off.
It's Denny's Doll breaking on top.
Attaboy Star.
Daddy's Poppa on the outside.
- Booky Baby on the rail and...
- Where's Sweet Jake?
Sweet Jake is still in the gate.
At the clubhouse turn. it's Denny's Doll by half a length.
Attaboy Star.
Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate.
Sweet Jake is moving.
He's way behind. but he's moving.
Uh-oh.
I think he stopped to have lunch.
I don't believe this.
Eat on your own time!
See what I mean?
Sweet Jake!
I should have bet on the Metropolitan Opera.
It's Attaboy Star by a length.
Booky Baby.
Denny's Doll and Seabottom.
Sweet Jake's finished eating and started running.
And. ladies and gentlemen. is he running.
But not even Silky Sullivan could come from this far behind.
It's Booky Baby taking the lead.
Daddy's Poppa moving into second.
Attaboy Star.
And making up incredible ground is Sweet Jake.
I have never seen anything like this.
But can he catch the pack?
At the top of the stretch. it's Booky Baby in the lead.
Daddy's Poppa.
And turning for home. it's Sweet Jake.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Give him the whip, dummy.
Attaboy.
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Jake.
Attaway.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Come on, boy!
That's it!
Hot dog!
We got it!
Yahoo!
Yeeha!
The story here today.
ladies and gentlemen. is Sweet Jake.
1500 smackeroos!
That calls for another beer.
- How about you?
I'm buying.
- No, thanks.
Oh, incidentally, Frank, you could use another six-pack.
I got a feeling I'm gonna murder them on the football games.
Frank, that's the solution to the money.
- No, no.
It's ridiculous. it won't work.
- Why won't it?
I don't know anything about placing a bet.
I wouldn't know where to go, what to do.
I gotta call Ernie with my football bets.
The Rams-Patriot game starts in 25 minutes.
- We'll have to take in another partner.
- Who?
- Him.
- Did you say something, Frank?
- Link?
Do you think that's wise?
- What's wise?
Who are you talking to?
Ask how many football games we can bet on.
- Who are you talking to?
- Ask him!
- It's crazy.
- Buddy?
- Who?
- How many football games on TV today?
Three pro games.
East, Midwest, Far West.
Who?
- Brief him.
- Have you got a tape machine going?
I don't think it's a good idea, but OK.
You know, I'd say you were talking to the cat.
I was.
Right.
Look, Frank, this can happen to anybody in government service.
That's why they have staff psychiatrists.
- Link.
Take a deep breath.
- OK.
- Remember that artichoke?
- Uh-huh.
Well, it all started when this spaceship...
- Spaceship?
- ...from another galaxy landed in a field.
Frank, let me get this straight, OK?
Now, you're trying to tell me that your little pussycat came from another planet from another galaxy in a spacecraft and landed on Earth?
- Is that it?
- That's right.
- You're squeezing.
- See?
You heard him talk.
Uh-huh.
Look.
I mean, I don't know how you're doing your little trick, you know.
But I gotta tell you something, it's dumb.
Very dumb.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna drink your last beer, watch three football games on your television set, and then I'm going home, because this is dumb, Frank.
Real dumb.
Now, that's dumb.
Aw, Link, look.
Listen to me for one minute.
I don't want to hear it, Frank.
I don't want to hear it, Frank!
- OK?
- OK.
Thank you.
That does it, Frank!
I'm going home and watch the Metropolitan Opera.
Oh, now, Link.
We need your help.
Jake needs your help!
I don't want to hear about it!
You're the only person I know who knows how to place a bet. I don't anything about...
What kind of a spaceship?
You're beautiful.
(phone rings)
You're down 200, sucker.
Would you like to double it?
Earnest Ernie's Sporting Club.
Weasel speaking.
What's your pleasure?
Yeah.
Give me four balls.
I'll double it.
- What do you say, Sarasota Slim?
- l say give him five.
The man says give him five.
You got it.
Honest Harry holds.
Link, can you make it fast?
We got a hot one on the rotisserie.
- Can I trust him?
- Would a crook be named Honest Harry?
You wanna bet what?
Hold on.
- Hey, Ernie.
Ernie, come here.
- Yeah.
Link wants to take his winnings from Sweet Jake and parlay the three football games.
You're kidding?
A three-game parlay?
Yeah.
It'll come to 120 G's if he makes it.
It's like taking candy from a baby, Weasel.
- He's down.
- You're down.
(man) Hold it right there.
General?
General?
Fingerprints, sir.
They found fingerprints.
On top of the hull, inside the cabin.
And they are the prints of a human being.
So whatever power brought this ship here was aided by some disloyal American.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with a collaborator.
I want the face that matches these prints.
Use the computer.
- Double pronto, sir.
- General!
General!
- Look at this.
They found more.
- What in blazes is that?
Fine hair, sir.
The pilot was wearing a fur coat.
Even more important, we found tiny prints in a claw-like pattern, like a pussycat's.
Pussycat?
Why aren't I hearing some tickety-tacks?
What about the fingerprints?
- There's a printout about to come through.
- Sir.
What do you want me to do with this?
- Get it checked, sir.
- Coming through, sir.
(Stilton) "ID
- Wilson, Frank.
Doctor.
Social Security, 631-07-0829."
"1951 to '55.
US Navy.
'55 to '62 Caltech."
"Current employment, theoretician." ERL?
!
- That's my Dr. Wilson!
- The scoundrel.
We'll have him in the slammer within the hour.
And blow the whole ball game?
Gentlemen, we're after Mr. Big, and this double-crossing fink is gonna lead us to him.
To find the rat, tail the cat.
- Cat?
- It's just an expression.
(football commentary on TV)
- Want a peanut, Jake?
- No, thanks.
I'll wait till Frank gets back.
- The Rams still ahead?
- Ahead?
The Rams won the game.
And without Jake's help.
Without your help, buddy.
Let's open the six-pack.
What will you have, Jake?
- Did you get some more of that tuna?
- Yeah, yeah.
Coming right up.
(TV) There's the two-minute warning.
Oilers leading 21- 19.
Houston driving.
- Another one in the bag.
- (knocking)
- Come in.
- Frank?
Uh-huh?
Hi.
Lucybelle insisted on coming, too.
- Coming?
- Yeah, the picnic.
Oh, the picnic.
- Beer, Liz?
- No, thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- Uh... (sneezes)
- Is his croup worse?
- Whose?
- Jake's.
- Oh.
Yeah.
Right.
I was up all night.
- Really?
- It's gone into hyperzemia.
What's hyperzemia?
- It's what Jake's got.
- What did your doctor do for him?
- Gave him two aspirin.
- Two aspirin?
- What's that?
What's happening, Frank?
- l don't know.
Two aspirin.
No wonder you're feeling worse.
- How did he get the ball?
- Interception.
- What this cat needs is some expert help.
- Get him.
- Dr. Wenger.
- Get him.
OK.
I'll go get him.
I'll be right back.
(Frank) Get him.
Somebody tackle him.
- Hi, sweetie.
Can I get you anything?
- (Link) OK.
Out of bounds on the 30.
Jake, why didn't you do something?
And spoil everybody's fun?
Look, guys, there's plenty of time.
You've got terrific whiskers.
Jake, will you pay attention?
They're within field-goal range. lf they make it, we're sunk.
No problem.
Believe me.
A little tuna, sweetheart?
Oh, Jake, concentrate, please.
The next few seconds could be crucial.
- Time out.
- (Liz) I appreciate it, Doctor.
At least you could have waited till the game was over. I have $10 on Chicago.
- You've got it on.
What's happening?
- Time out.
This is Dr. Wenger.
Dr. Wenger, here's the patient.
I definitely think he needs your attention.
All right.
- How did they get to the 30?
- (Link) Interception.
- Happened while we were in the elevator.
- (TV) ...or a field goal?
(Liz) What do you think?
- l think they should try for a field goal.
- About the cat.
Hmm?
Oh, he's tense, he's very tense.
The shoulder muscles are all bunched up.
- Where do you want to examine him?
- Right here will be fine.
OK.
Let me get this out of the way.
Also, let's, first thing, get this collar off.
Hey!
Good thinking, Chicago.
(TV) This year. he's never missed inside the 35-yard line.
- Get through that line now.
- That guy can't kick a ball 60 yards.
- Block that kick.
Block that kick.
- (meowing)
Will you calm down now?
Hold the cat, please.
Jake, you better do something.
- Where's his collar?
- Block that...
- It's right here, Frank.
- Huh?
- Give it to me, Liz.
Give it to me.
- Frank, I'm just gonna hold the...
- I'm gonna give him a sedative.
- No, don't do that!
Frank, let go of the cat.
There's the snap.
It's down.
The kick is up.
It's long enough.
It's straight enough.
It's...
It's...
It's flat!
I've never seen anything like it.
The ball flattened out in midair.
There's the gun.
- Jake?
- The Oilers have won it 21- 19.
I told you not to do that!
I only came here as a favor to a neighbor.
As a rule, I do not make house calls.
You sure picked a dumb time to break your rule.
Dr. Link!
Look, Dr. Wenger, please forgive him.
He's a new cat-owner.
Jake.
Jake, it's me, Jake.
Oh, Frank, we're finished.
He's blotto.
Well, look on the bright side.
San Diego could still win.
Yeah, and San Diego could still lose.
And where does that leave this poor little guy?
He's blown his rendezvous and my 1500 clams.
That was very rude, Frank.
- Liz, butt out.
- What?
- Cancel the bet.
Call Ernie.
- He'll never buy it.
- Look, what's going on here?
- Jake, we got problems.
Speak to me.
Is everybody crazy?
The line is busy.
We'll never get through.
He's taking bets.
- We'd better get down there.
- Like yesterday.
Just a minute, Frank.
I would like...
No, I demand an explanation.
What's going on?
- Later, Liz.
- No.
Now.
We have got exactly six minutes before that game starts.
- Watch it, Link.
I'm a black belt.
- OK.
We'll tell you in the elevator.
Remember that meeting we had with Dr. Heffel and General Stilton at the ERL?
(Liz) Outer space?
- Frank Wilson, are you putting me on?
- No, no.
Remember that artichoke?
Dydee One calling Hopscotch.
Come in, Big Cheese.
This is Big Cheese.
Go ahead, Dydee One.
Do you still have contact with the subject?
Yes, sir.
Also that garbage expert and the dame from the car pool.
And they're all going into Earnest Ernie's pool hall.
Looks like a Mafia tie-in.
Mafia?
What kind of an operation you running down there, Heffel?
Lucky!
(laughs)
Really lucky.
Ernie?
Ernie?
Excuse me.
Ernie?
- Hi, Ernie.
- Well, look who's here.
Hiya, Doc.
Uh, Ernie, I wanna cancel my Chargers bet.
- You wanna cancel your Chargers bet?
- Yeah, cancel my Chargers bet.
Really?
Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Just a hunch, sort of.
Hey, not a bad hunch.
The Chargers are ten points behind.
- Already?
- (cheering) 16, boss, 16.
Steelers just scored another one.
Sorry, Doc.
Is he taking a nap?
- Yeah.
- Is that TV picture still out?
Well, there goes 120,000.
1500 of which is mine.
- Isn't there anything you can do?
- Not while Jake is out.
Jake, wake up.
- Is he breathing?
- He's snoring.
OK.
OK.
Isn't there anything else we can bet on?
Yeah.
Maybe we could get lucky.
Another football game?
- Next Sunday.
- Basketball?
- Tuesday night.
- Hockey?
- Hockey?
- Hockey.
Ernie, is there a hockey game today that we could put a few bucks on?
Sorry.
Horse race?
Boxing?
- Demolition derby?
Anything to get even.
- No.
But if you want a little action, there's always my good friend Sarasota Slim.
- Sarasota Slim?
- Yes.
He indulges occasionally in a friendly pool game with a slight wager on the side.
- Nothing doing.
- Why not?
- He's a hustler.
- Who isn't?
OK.
It's a bet.
What are the odds?
You against Sarasota Slim?
- Right.
- Frank.
Because I want to give you a chance to break even and because I like your style, let's say 8 to 1.
That's all?
What about him?
- Me?
- Link?
Well, considering the shape he's in, I'd say maybe 10 to 1.
- Ohh.
What about the lady?
- Me?
- Liz?
- Considering the shape she's in, 20 to 1.
- OK.
You got a bet.
- Frank!
Arch, set 'em up.
Another sucker just swam into the net.
Frank, I don't know anything about this game.
Are you bananas?
That guy can make a pool ball sit up and do the boogaloo.
I know, but I've got the equalizer...
the collar.
- How are you gonna do that?
Jake's out.
- I've used it, to repair the spaceship.
- You?
- Yes.
I've flown.
Charlie, give me the special, and heavy on the onions.
- Taking a nap?
- Yeah.
Throw in a few chili peppers, huh?
- Frank, I don't want to take the risk...
- Liz, you've got to do it.
I'm desperate.
No money, no gold.
No gold, no liftoff.
But... (clears throat)
But if we deliver, look what we get in return... the solution to half the problems on this planet.
- Just show me how to hold the pole.
- Good girl.
We need a stake.
I've got about 12 bucks.
It's in my hip pocket.
Will you get it for me?
- OK, that's 12.
How much do you have?
- Me?
I think I got 20.
- 20?
Liz?
- Uh...
- l just have my mad money.
- Give it to us.
Please?
Come on.
Boy, when this dame gets mad, she gets mad.
I was going to buy a whole spring wardrobe, Link.
- OK.
Ernie.
- Boss, here's the bankroll.
- Ernie, we bet 300 at 20 to 1.
- Check.
Not in your lifetime, Ernie.
Honest Harry holds.
All right, you want Honest Harry, you got Honest Harry.
300 at 20 to 1.
That's 6,000 clams.
And here's our 300.
Earnest Ernie, 6,000.
The mark, 300.
6300.
And may the best man win.
Or woman, as the case may be.
Young lady, it's your break.
Come on, don't be so stingy with the onions.
Here, take the collar, Liz.
OK, here.
Link, keep your eye on him.
If he blinks just once...
Miss?
Do you mind?
We're waiting.
- Now, that's a sandwich.
Right?
- (sniffs)
Right.
- Taking a nap.
- Naturally.
Nice break, young lady.
Very nice.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink anything,
- but there's always tomorrow.
- (laughter)
Show her how to do it.
OK, Slim, go get her.
Ooh, I can't watch this. (laughs)
- Frank, I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.
(ball pockets. applause)
(ball pockets. applause)
(man) Attaway, Slim.
Attaway, baby.
I guess we are licked.
If only Jake hadn't got knocked out... (whispers) Frank!
Frank, look.
Jake!
Jake?
Frank, he must have just woke up.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Yeah.
Where am I?
What happened?
I'm Liz Bartlett.
I'm responsible for your being...
- Liz, Liz, sshh.
- Oh, well.
Jake, we have got to win this pool game.
That's money in the bank.
Look at it!
Honest Harry, guess who's here?
Ernie?
Here's our last 60 bucks.
What are the odds now?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
- No bet.
- No bet?
It's part of my code of ethics.
Always leave the sucker rent money.
That's not fair!
Honest Harry?
If the mark wants to go complete top city, he's got a constitutional right.
And I stand on it.
The odds, Ernie?
It's ridiculous.
But if I didn't have no principles, I'd say 100 to 1.
Suppose...
Suppose she gives Sarasota Slim 12 balls?
What a sense of humor!
300 to 1.
- And the break.
- The break?
500 to 1.
And blindfolded.
- What?
- Blindfolded!
- 2,000 to 1.
- You're on.
$60 at 2,000 to 1.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Are you seriously serious?
- You're not thinking of welching, are you?
- But I thought you was putting me on.
Earnest Ernie, it would not do your reputation any credit if word was to circulate that you reneged on a wager duly offered and accepted.
- Get the big bundle, Weasel.
- But, boss...
Get it!
All right.
Let me understand this.
Slim gets 12 balls and the break?
- And she shoots blindfolded.
- (laughs)
She'll never get to the table.
120 Gs, boss.
Don't put it away, Honest Harry, you ain't gonna hold it long.
All right, Slim.
Show 'em no mercy.
Nice.
Nice break, Slim.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink nothing, but there's always tomorrow.
- l believe I'm up.
- Hold it.
Blindfolded.
Oh.
Could you back off?
(applause)
You did it, Jake.
You did it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
it was really nothing.
Thank you.
Frank, we won!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, all of you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about things being upside down, but I took these pictures at risk of life and limb.
There's the cat, sir.
Notice his collar?
Well, well.
What did you think of it, Mr. Olympus?
It's just mind-boggling, isn't it?
I mean, it boggled my mind.
Did it boggle yours, sir?
Thank you, Omar.
Yes, Mr. Stallwood, you are quite correct.
it is "mind-boggling," as you so graphically put it.
The possibilities are infinite.
A revolution in transportation, space exploration, colonizing the planets.
The man who owns the secret of this device could control...
The world, sir?
The universe.
Oh, my!
Well, then, sir, I don't suppose it would be out of place to suggest a bonus.
- A bonus?
- A small bonus.
Mr. Stallwood, if I gain the secret of that device, you may well become a very rich man.
I may?
Oh, sir, I... really may?
Omar, prepare the copter.
We leave at once.
I must have that collar.
I will have that collar.
OK.
All set, General.
- Is it programmed?
- All the pertinent information fed in.
- Everything we know.
- Question number one, sir.
Question number one.
Who is the pilot?
it is a pussycat!
This machine is having a nervous breakdown.
Get on the ball, young man.
Feed that information through again.
Reassess.
Yes, sir.
- General Stilton, sir.
- What is it, Sergeant?
That purchase Dr. Link made... we checked it out.
It's a large quantity of gold.
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.
It's a Machiavellian conspiracy.
Radio.
This is Big Cheese calling Dydee One.
Where are you, Dydee One?
Outside the suspect's apartment.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Another printout, General.
Of all the...
Wait a minute.
Radio.
- Dydee One.
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't they carry a cat into that pool hall?
- Yes, sir, they did.
Gentlemen, it's time to move in.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
$120,000 in one lump sum.
Jake, how'd you like to hang around and watch me parlay this into a fortune?
- l wish I could hang around.
- I'm sorry, Jake.
The time?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, Lucy.
- l guess I'd better reduce the gold.
- Reduce it?
- What are you talking about?
- It's a new concept in calculating mass.
On Jake's planet, they use a system based on content, rather than on the quantitative...
Frank!
You've got a whole lifetime to explain that.
I've got less than an hour.
Now, stand back, everybody.
- All right, don't move!
All hands in the air!
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Frank Wilson?
- You can't butt in here!
- Dr. Frank Wilson, you are under arrest.
- And the pussycat, General.
And the pussycat.
- Read them their rights, Colonel.
- Captain?
- Sergeant?
- Never mind.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right...
- Good heavens.
- Frank...
- What happened?
- (Frank) They're frozen.
Holy mackerel!
Now they're on to us, how are we to get into Hopscotch?
You can't zap the whole base.
- Yeah, well, I'll think of something.
- They'll probably be on alert.
First things first.
Let's get this gold reduced, then we'll worry about getting on the base.
Now stand back.
OK.
Here goes.
Ohh.
That is unbelievable.
Oh, Jake.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
(Link) Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. I think I've got the perfect way to get us onto the base.
Maybe we ought to give 'em a buzz.
Think we ought to give 'em a buzz?
Yeah, give 'em a buzz.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in.
Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
- What's the military doing here?
- This could be complicated, sir.
What isn't?
- Get that door closed!
- Uh-oh.
What does it all mean?
it means it's exceptionally complicated.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Ah, here comes General Cheese.
I mean, Stilton.
- (Frank) Wait.
Hold Jake for a minute.
- Yes.
- How do I look?
- Could you hold Lucy for a minute?
- Do I look like a general?
- Oh, well...
Frank, you look very commanding.
- That'll have to do.
Let's go.
- OK.
He got the cat.
That's the cat!
Where's the general going with those two?
That's the general?
It's not?
Open your door!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Halt!
Halt in the name of the US...
Fantastic.
- Listen, good luck, huh?
- Yeah.
Be careful.
- Bye, Lucybelle.
Thanks for everything.
- Yeah, yeah.
Let's go.
Bye.
- They've escaped?
- Yes.
But, fortunately for us, they left something very valuable behind.
(car door opens)
- General Stilton?
- Of course!
Of course.
I'll sign you in, sir.
General Stilton and cat.
Is the cat cleared, sir?
- What do you think?
- Sorry, sir.
I want the hangar open.
All personnel out.
We're moving the ship.
But sir, if we order 'em out of the hangar, how are you gonna...
- Soldier!
- Out of the hangar, sir.
Yes, sir.
Get the hangar doors open.
All personnel out of the hangar on the double.
- First, let's get the ship out of the hangar.
- Check.
..to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you're being...
(sniggering)
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Hold it right here, Frank.
130 to countdown.
Hurry.
Insert the gold in the microtransformer.
Right, right.
- Got it.
- Good.
Now let's see if we have contact.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
- Where's the microphone?
- Frank!
OK, OK.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
Hi there. fella.
See you made it with nothing to spare.
- We had problems.
- We are 105 to liftoff.
Coming in on ray 0392.
Adjust transmuter.
- Adjustment made.
- Countdown starts at 20.
Set clinometers.
- Clinometers set.
Give me a printout.
- Coming your way without delay.
- That's another cat?
- Oh, yeah.
A real mother.
- l gotta get to that spaceship right away.
- Who are you?
A friend of Frank Wil...
I mean General Stilton.
A very good friend.
Let's go.
Open the gate.
My car!
- Them, too.
- Never mind.
Let's get down to Hopscotch.
- Sergeant.
- Captain.
Colonel.
- General.
- Oh, get in!
- (Mother Ship) Counting down.
- Hey, Frank!
Hold it, sir, right there.
General, this man says...
Hey!
You're not General Stilton.
- Frank.
- What are you doing here?
Frank, it's a nightmare.
Liz has been captured by Stallwood.
Have you been hitting the beer?
Stallwood of Supplies?
He's an agent for some guy named Olympus, a power-crazed creep who's...
- He's holding her for ransom.
- Lucybelle, too?
Yeah, he wants that collar, Jake.
It's the collar or Liz.
- Where is she?
- I'm going with you, Frank.
No, no, you don't want to get stuck here on Earth.
You're responsible to your mission.
- But I'm the reason for the mess they're in.
- Do you know where they're taking her?
- Place called Dailey's Airport.
- Do you know where it is?
Let's go.
- Frank...
- Jake, you're going home.
Now, get in there.
So long, buddy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
5. 4 3. 2.
ignite.
Bye, Jake.
Drop us a card.
OK, you clowns.
Let's move it.
Let's go.
Jake!
Jake, this is insane.
You're here forever, on Earth.
You're wasting time.
The airport!
General, look!
(General) Good heavens!
That's my car.
Get the police on the radio.
- Hello, Sequoia?
- Turn around!
Here comes a car.
It's Wilson.
Yeah, and Link.
And the cat!
They're here.
They've come.
Naturally.
You knew they would.
You knew it.
We've won.
Now they will have turn over the cat and we will turn over the girl.
We will?
We won't?
it may be difficult to explain your part in this after the young lady's gone to the police.
Oh, dear.
You wouldn't dare?
Frank, that must be the chopper.
(sirens wailing)
It's the police, sir.
It's a trap.
The fools!
Get us airborne.
(Jake) Watch it!
- They're getting away!
- Yeah.
But look who's arriving - the army and the police.
We have to follow that copter.
What kind of an airport is this?
Where are the planes?
Follow me.
Oh, you can't fly this, Jake.
It's a wreck.
Look at that propeller - it's half gone.
- Are you coming or staying?
- I'm coming.
I'm staying.
OK, tovarisch.
Ponimayete po-russki?
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
- Parlez-vous Francis?
- What?
- All right, Dr. Garbage Expert.
Who's your accomplice?
Who's flying that plane?
Uh...
General, you're not gonna believe this.
There they are.
- It's Wilson and the cat.
- How did they get that wreck in the air?
The power that cat possesses is awesome.
You betcha, Charlie, and if you know what's good for you, you'll land...
- Quiet!
- OK.
Faster, Omar, faster.
Get close.
Use the collar to force them to land.
No chance.
It's taking all I got just to keep this crate flying.
Don't panic.
We'll think of something.
What's happening?
Why aren't they doing something?
Of course!
They're afraid of harming the girl.
Turn on them, Omar.
The advantage is ours.
What's happening?
Why are they turning around?
Straight at them, Omar.
Drive them down.
Frank!
Jake!
(Frank screams)
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake.
Jake.
Turn this thing over.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake.
Jake!
Frank, are you OK?
- What are they trying to do?
- Force us down.
They probably figured out that we've got a problem.
Hold on.
Here they come.
- They're still on our tail.
- Don't panic.
On top of them, Omar.
Smash them down!
Whoa!
(Jake) I see 'em.
I see 'em.
Look out.
Jake!
Jake!
- Here they come again.
Jake.
- Yeah, yeah.
Fruitcake.
Frank, watch out!
Jake, Jake.
(Jake yowls)
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
Jake.
Oh, dear.
Jake.
Break off!
(gasps)
Buzz them again, Omar, and this time, everybody open fire.
(gunshot)
(coughing)
- What happened?
- You happened, you imbecile!
- How bad is it, Omar?
- He got the controls.
They're locked.
When the fuel runs out, we're through.
Shall we bail out?
We have no choice.
Bail out?
Where are you going?
I haven't got a parachute, either.
- Then you have a problem.
- l haven't got a parachute either.
Then you have the same problem.
Wait!
No, wait!
Wait a minute!
I d...
I don't want to die!
Oh, swell.
Frank!
Frank!
(groans)
Yes, Mr. President.
Absolutely, Mr. President.
We're just waiting for them to land and we'll pass that on.
- Yes, sir.
- What'd he say?
Jake is to be treated as the representative of a friendly power, with generous borrowing credit.
In exchange for bases, of course.
Look, sir, chutes.
They bailed out.
Holy mackerel!
Who's flying the chopper?
Frank!
Easy, Liz.
Don't panic.
- What are you gonna do, Frank?
- l don't know, but I have to do something.
Hand me Lucybelle!
- Careful, Frank!
- l got her.
- Just hold on, honey, and we'll get Liz.
- Get us up closer to the copter.
Right.
Liz, when we get close enough, grab my hand.
Frank, you're too far away!
(Frank) Closer, Jake.
Closer!
Grab my hand, Liz.
Grab it!
Grab it!
Liz, careful.
- OK.
- Now grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Good.
That's good.
That's good.
- Now grab my hand and step off.
- Step off?
- Liz!
- Huh?
Ohh...
- Frank, I don't think this is gonna work.
- All right.
We'll try it again.
Never mind.
We'll try something else.
- All right, put your feet on my shoulders.
- What?
Put your feet right there, on my shoulders.
No!
Liz, do it!
OK.
OK.
- Oh...
Oh...
Ohh!
- Whoa!
You see?
Everything's gonna be OK, Lucybelle.
Just relax.
Jake!
Jake, what are you doing?
You know, when I saw you up in that chopper, I just...
Huh?
Well, honey, looks like you're stuck with me.
(explosion)
Don't just hang there.
Get me out of this.
- Don't worry.
I'll get you loose.
- What are you doing with that?
Fortunately, I never go anywhere without my Swiss Army knife.
Idiot!
(man) All rise.
Hear ye.

What is that light?
I don't know.
You stay right here, Edna.
Don't leave the house.
I'm gonna take a look at it.
Come on, Dutch.
Chicken.
Holy mackerel!
This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother Ship.
This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
This is Mother Ship.
Have you completed emergency landing?
Affirmative, Mother.
Request repair party.
Negative, Zunar J5.
You'll have to effect emergency repairs yourself.
And rendezvous with us at grid dissect 8304 at 69 hours minus 17.
- That's an awfully tight squeeze.
- Unavoidable, Zunar.
Next mission to this galaxy due in 115.
- Days?
- Years.
Good luck, Zunar J5.
Over and out.
Yeah.
So long, Mother.
I don't see any hammer and sickle, do you, Colonel?
Maybe it's on the inside, General.
No sign of life, either.
Get me the Pentagon, red priority.
I want to speak to the chiefs, Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Sequoia here.
Come in, Rover.
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Wipe it out of your minds.
You've seen nothing and heard nothing.
- Yes, sir.
- We'll want them later.
Take their names.
Colonel.
Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Names?
- Charlie Cooney.
General Stilton!
We're ready when you are, sir.
- Bullhorn.
- Yes, sir.
On to Hopscotch.
All right, men.
Let's move it!
- Let's move out.
Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
When we get to Hopscotch, I want mark-four priority security.
Armor, personnel, guard dogs, the works.
And not one word to public relations.
Not one word.
You got that, Colonel?
Yes, sir.
You got that, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
Sergeant?
- Got it.
Well?
It's a brilliant technological achievement.
It's state of the art.
You trying to tell me something, Allison?
- It's definitely not one of ours, General.
- How about Russia?
Certainly not Russia.
It's far beyond...
OK, Allison.
Lay it on the line.
Whose is it?
I don't know, General.
We'd better find out.
I wanna know who made it, flew it and where it came from.
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Contact SigCom on our radio.
Get Hungerford at Air.
Call Steinmetz at Johns Hopkins, Lasser, Billings, Cranhammer.
- Get them IQs off their tennis courts.
- Yes, sir.
Double pronto!
If we don't find out where that thing came from, this country could be in trouble, big, big trouble.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
You say it's not man-made, Allison.
What's that leave us?
Outer space.
With no sign of the pilot.
Big, big trouble.
While you and I are talking this very minute, some slimy green-headed 12-legged creep could be crawling into the White House.
Big, big trouble.
We're up against genius.
We'd better come up with some genius of our own.
I believe, General, you've already met my assistant, Dr. Corday.
I'd like to introduce some members of our team.
Dr. Robeson of Caltech, who's our expert on fossil fuel.
Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins.
Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett, who heads Thermal.
Huh.
Dr. Norman Link, who's been doing some intriguing work in garbage research.
- So what?
- Dr. Link.
Just a second, Dr. Heffel.
I have to relay some vital information to a colleague.
Oh, yes.
This is our hard-water man, Dr. Leach.
Right, Ernie.
The Lakers by a point and a half for 100 bucks.
When will you have the line on Philly and the New York Knicks?
I'd like you to meet Mr. Jurist, who also is involved in Thermal.
And there's Dr. Banford, Professor Epstein, Doctors Davidson and Barrett.
And, of course, this is Dr. Humphrey, our head of Nuclear.
Mr. Stallwood, our head of Procurement and Supplies.
What are you doing here?
When the call went out for an emergency meeting, I naturally assumed...
You assumed wrong.
Scientists.
Double-A clearance only.
Out.
- But I might have a contribution.
- If we need any pencils, I'll send for you.
- But, Dr. Heffel...
- Out.
Sorry, General.
Where was I?
Oh, yes.
Professor...
Dr. Heffel, I didn't come for a roll call, I came to pick brains.
Are they all here?
- Yes.
These are our top people.
- Then let's get to it!
I understand, General.
Attention, everyone.
Dr. Link.
That's it, Professor.
I'll call tomorrow with more input.
Bye.
All right, Sergeant.
Open it.
Drapes.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is top secret.
The United States government will countenance no leaks.
Now.
What's holding it up?
- Nothing.
- It's amazing.
- Where did you get it?
- What is it?
A propulsion unit of some sort, ladies and gentlemen.
Never mind where we got it.
We have other experts working on that.
What we want to know from you is, what makes it tick?
OK.
Let's have your hypothesis.
Uh, the energy source could be atomic.
We've checked on that.
Negative.
Direct conversion, utilizing thermionic...
- Checked out.
Negative.
- Oh.
It's not propelled by garbage, I know that.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Come in, Olympus.
Mr. Olympus?
This is Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something very big and very...
Jellyfish.
Your man in ERL?
Yes, sir.
That Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something.
No, sir.
I think you'll find this a great deal more interesting than my last report.
Right now, Dr. Heffel is in a secret meeting with a four-star general and a whole gaggle of scientists.
What are they meeting about?
I don't know, sir, it's a secret.
Get in there and find out?
Do any of you have a solid evaluation?
Not a guess, a solid premise?
Do you?
Well?
Do you think it might be fruitful to bring Dr. Wilson into this discussion, Dr. Heffel?
- Wilson?
- Yes.
He might very well come up with an applicable theory.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Who's Dr. Wilson?
- He's in my carpool.
Oh...
That is, we live in the same building.
- That certainly qualifies him.
- Oh.
No.
What I'm trying to say is, he's a very bright young physicist who's come here recently on loan from Caltech.
A loan, I might add, that is bearing absolutely no interest.
He's a little unorthodox, but a brilliant theorist.
- General Stilton isn't interested in...
- Get him.
- What?
- Get him.
His output couldn't be any less than what we've gotten so far.
Yes, General.
He really has an unusual mind.
- Well, Dr. Wilson?
- It's beautiful.
Don't you have any other observation?
- Only that it looks like an artichoke.
- We know it looks like an artichoke.
What makes it tick?
Mayonnaise?
Negative.
No, I was only joking, sir.
I do have a theory, sir, actually, in line with the work I've been doing.
I have a hunch it's tapping the primal mainstream.
The primal mainstream?
It's everywhere, only on different frequencies.
The whole electromagnetic spectrum -
Cosmic, gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, radio waves.
Do you know how much we finite human beings can tune into with our senses?
Less than five percent.
The universe makes its own energy.
We even make it ourselves.
Yes, take biofeedback, for instance.
If I taped terminals to your head, General, your brain could run an electric train.
- Electric train?
- I'm sorry, General.
Perhaps electric train wasn't the most apt example.
Thank you very much.
- Let me have that for a couple of months...
- Thank you.
A couple of months?
Dr. Heffel?
- Yes, General?
- I want action.
You know, Drexel, I've seen the most amazing thing.
Amazing.
But don't ask me to tell you about it.
It's classified.
Thank you, Drexel.
Well.
How did you get in here?
Huh?
Now look, you're asking for trouble.
Dr. Heffel isn't too crazy about animals in the building.
Fact is, he isn't too crazy about people in the building either.
What's your name, huh?
Charlie?
Cuddles?
Jake?
Yes, yes.
You look like Jake.
That, Jake, is the Van Allen belt.
Oil and coal is not going to do it, you know.
And, one of these days, that sun of ours is going to turn into a big black hole.
You know where it's really at, Jake?
Electromagnetism.
We're loaded with it.
You know, it's crazy, but you almost look like you know what I'm talking about.
All right, give me a hand with this, Sergeant.
Easy, easy.
That's it.
Stallwood, administration emergency!
That's some fancy collar you got there.
Maybe I'll take you home with me.
My neighbor Liz has a cat named Lucybelle.
She's really cute.
And the cat's not bad either.
Liz!
Hi.
Ouch!
I've...
- We were just talking about you.
- Were you?
This is Jake.
I'm going to take him home with us.
You won't have to drive Professor Link and myself home tonight.
- Heffel's called a late meeting.
- I can wait.
That won't be necessary.
- How about a coffee?
- No.
- Chocolate chip cookie?
- No.
- Are you sore or something?
- Sore?
Sore?
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- What is it?
What did I do?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Mayonnaise?
Electric trains?
Well, now, look, really, all that...
that was just a joke, Doctor.
Well, nobody laughed, especially the general.
Has he had water?
- The general?
- The cat.
Oh.
Water?
Cats do get thirsty, you know.
Do you have a bowl?
A bowl?
Right here, yes.
Here.
- Water?
- Yes, right, water.
Look, Liz...
Dr. Bartlett.
Just because some general lacks a sense of humor, that's no reason...
- All I was trying to convey...
- I'm really not interested, Doctor.
Besides, I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's just that the magnitude of what the general showed us just bowled me over.
- It did?
- Oh, completely.
- Black.
- What?
- Didn't you offer me a cup of coffee?
- Right.
Check.
Coming right up.
I really don't understand, that's all.
The man who wrote the article you did for The Scientific Quarterly...
- You read it?
- Well, of course.
It was brilliant.
I've been wanting to tell you.
We don't get much chance to talk in the car pool, but I've been following your work.
- You have?
- Closely.
It's very impressive, very innovative, very attractive.
I mean, it's bound to attract attention.
Oh, well, um,
I am writing an article at the moment and I would love to have your criticism.
Oh.
Maybe at lunch or, even better, at dinner sometime?
- Yeah, I'd like that.
When?
- Tonight?
No, that's right, you've got that late meeting.
That may not go all that late.
I should be out by seven.
Is that too late?
- Seven's beautiful.
- Good.
Well...
Oh, thanks for the coffee.
It was delicious.
- I think she digs you.
- I sure hope so.
- Who said that?
- I did.
Frank, we'd better get down to business.
Sit down.
We've gotta talk.
I'm running out of time, and you're the only one I can depend on to help me.
- It's you?
- It's not the mouse.
Now, sit down.
But your lips aren't moving.
You're not speaking.
Thought transference.
Nothing exceptional where I come from.
Now, sit.
My name is Zunar J5/9 Doric 4-7.
Zunar...?
Why don't we just stay with Jake, OK?
Frank, last night at 03 hours plus 13,
I made an emergency landing in a spaceship from another galaxy.
That so-called artichoke... it's from my craft.
But... you're a cat.
Granted.
But you see, in our civilization, that's as far as we needed to evolve.
We developed our brain to a fine point.
Now, man rose off his four legs and developed tools, machinery, agriculture and a chronic pain in his lower back.
We developed tools for the mind.
This collar here, it amplifies brain power.
- It does what?
- Well, it provides energy by which we...
Look, let me give you a demonstration.
Not a bad little tune.
Mm-mmm.
Frank, this is really delicious.
What is it?
Oh, it's chopped kidney.
It's all they had at the deli.
It really hits the spot.
I'm gonna take a couple of cases for my trip back.
Sure beats the blah I've been eating.
Well, now back to my problem.
Frank, I need an answer.
- What do you say?
- Say about what?
Can I count on you to help me repair my spaceship?
- Why me?
- Because I like the way you think.
Your equations rather interest me.
In fact, they're really not bad at all... for a human.
- Really?
I'm on the right track?
- Quite definitely, but years away from a solution.
Frank, on my planet, we have an expression - you rub my fur, I'll rub yours.
How would you like to make a quantum jump?
You help me, and I'll give you a push in the right direction.
- You're serious?
- I'm serious.
- You really are from outer space?
- I am from outer space.
- Even though you're a cat?
- Frank!
Is it a deal?
It's a deal.
Oh, that's...
We better move.
I've got to make repairs to my ship by 5:13 Sunday for liftoff, or I'll miss the rendezvous with the mother ship.
Right.
I'll get my sweater.
Uh, do you think that you can find your way back to that airport?
No problem.
I made a memory imprint.
- With the collar?
- Right.
Fantastic.
How developed does your brain have to be to use that collar?
Not very.
In fact, you could handle it.
You wanna try?
Do we have time?
Why not?
Look, just grab hold of it.
Easy.
Don't take it off.
Without it, I'm just an average cat.
Right.
- Right.
OK?
- OK.
- Now just concentrate.
- Concentrate.
Think levitation.
Levitation.
You're as light as a feather.
Look at me.
I'm floating!
It's just plain incredible!
- Look, one hand.
- You're losing your concentration.
Yeah.
Hi, Frank.
Gotta use your set.
The ball goes crosscourt to Brown.
He brings it...
- What were you doing up in the air?
- Uh...
- Astronaut exercises.
- Oh.
- Link, I'm busy.
- Yeah.
Well, just forget I'm here.
The last minute of the game, and Francine throws me out of the apartment.
Why does she throw me out?
For one lousy cigar burn on the chair.
- When did you get a cat?
- Jake's not my cat.
He's just visiting.
- Hi, Jake.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Do you mind, Frank?
Remember.
The score's tied at 108.
Atlanta has the ball and a basket could win it.
Win it?
Oh, man!
And I gave a point and a half.
There goes my 100 bucks.
Come on, defense.
Come on, guys.
Man to man, we'll...
The crowd is really on its feet now.
The guy in the corner.
He's alone and closely guarded by King.
King steals the ball.
What a play.
Here come the Lakers.
Five seconds left.
Puts up a shot.
But a prayer.
There's no chance.
Wait...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
I don't believe it.
He scores!
He made it in the last second.
And the Lakers will win it by two.
Unbelievable!
Frank, did you see that?
Yeah.
I'm really gonna have to ask you to leave.
- I could use another beer.
- I'm out of beer, I'm sorry.
- How about a ginger ale?
- I'm out of that, too.
- Could I at least finish my cigar?
- Link, please.
I'd like to have a little celebration.
I'll see you later.
The basketball game?
You did that?
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
It was the fastest way to get rid of that flake.
Let's go.
It's less than 36 hours to liftoff.
Right.
Oh...
Do you think I ought to carry you, so people don't suspect you're not an ordinary cat?
Good thinking, Frank.
Besides, my left paw's been acting up again.
- An old football injury?
- Actually, no.
Polo.
Now let's go.
What about getting into Hopscotch?
It'll be guarded.
- I'll handle that, too.
- It's fantastic.
Hi.
Hi, this is Lucybelle.
What'd you say you call him?
- Jake.
- Jake, right.
Jake, this is Lucybelle.
I thought they could get acquainted while we're at dinner.
- At dinner?
- Yeah.
It was tonight, wasn't it?
Right.
Right, yes.
I was just about to call you.
Something came up.
I'm afraid you're going to have to give me a rain check.
Oh.
Oh, well, of course.
It really doesn't matter.
But it does.
It matters a lot, Liz.
Dr. Bartlett.
You see, what happened was...
It's Jake.
He took sick.
Suddenly.
Out of the blue.
Really?
What is it?
I think it's, uh, Tasmanian Croup.
You poor thing.
You know, he sounds terrible.
You'd better not let her get too close.
Stop milking it.
- What?
- I said I was about to rush him to the vet's.
The vet.
That's a good idea, Frank.
D'you know there's a very good vet who lives in the building?
A Dr. Wenger.
He specializes in cats.
I'm sure he'd be glad to take a look at him.
Jake prefers a general practitioner.
I'm sorry about dinner.
I'll make it up to you.
- How about a picnic?
- Tomorrow?
- You handled that very well.
- I didn't enjoy lying to Liz.
She's a very unusual person.
- Her kitty-cat's not too bad either.
- There's plenty of time for that.
That's all right for you to say.
But I've been confined to a spaceship for five months.
Ohh...
- The ship's in that big hangar.
- Oh.
There's got to be a way in.
- It's locked.
- No problem.
- Come on, come on.
- Right, right.
The coast is clear.
Let's go!
There she is.
Somebody's coming.
- Somebody's coming, Frank!
- I know, I know.
What's happening?
It's all clear.
- Let's go!
- It's this way.
Forget it.
It wears off in 20 minutes.
He won't remember a thing.
Come on, let's go.
Incredible.
An older model, but in pretty good shape for a rig with nearly a trillion miles on it.
Now let's see about getting it operational again.
We've only got 34 hours left.
Right.
Through here?
Hm-hm.
Put me down.
Oh, it's just incredible.
The artichoke.
I was right.
- What's this... control panel?
- Uh-huh.
Sort of.
- And this?
- Uh, computer.
- Then this must be the readout.
- Frank, later.
I'll explain it all later, I promise.
- First, disengage the transducer system.
- How?
Take that neo-mag intercog, and you'll find the transducer switch on top of the ship.
Just coordinate with me.
Well, how do I get up there?
- Fly.
- Fly?
You mean use your collar?
Don't be ridiculous.
We carry a spare.
Concentrate, and when you get on top, engage the switch with the intercog and thought-project "seven max triad. "
- Seven max triad.
- Right.
The computer will do the rest.
Seven max triad.
Right.
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hey, Frank, what are you doing up there?
What about the intercog?
Frank?
Jake, I'm ready to plug it in.
Right.
Go ahead.
- It's in.
- OK.
Thought-project.
Seven max triad.
OK, Frank.
Come on down.
Amazing.
I was afraid of that.
The focal terminal on the microtransformer's vaporized.
- You're sure?
- Positive.
But I'll double-check.
- Just what I thought.
- That's where the focal terminal goes?
Acts as a catalyzer.
I'll need a small amount of org 12.
- What's org 12?
- What the focal terminal's made of.
About six cubits ought to be enough.
You don't have org 12 on this planet?
Never heard of it.
Is it like mayonnaise?
You probably call it by a different name.
Stand back.
I'll run it through the computer.
Hey, Tom!
You all right?
Tom!
Org 12...
ductile yellow metallic element.
Melting point - 1.063.
Tensile strength - 19.000.
- Tensile strength what?
- 19.000.
Atomic weight - 196.967.
Wait a minute.
That's the atomic weight of gold.
Wow!
Out!
Out!
Everybody out!
What is that?
Come on, let's go.
Follow me!
Holy cow.
- Give my collar room.
- You can't zap the whole base.
Let's get out of here.
Over here!
Follow me!
Move out!
Watch it!
Come back here!
Where are you going?
Come out of there.
You're under arrest!
Look out!
What is it?
Get it off of me!
Get it off!
Was anybody in there?
Back it out.
Look out.
Who's driving?
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!
- Yes, sir?
- Who sounded that alarm?
I did, sir.
We have an intruder, and his cat.
Cat?
Cat?
Cat?
Yes, sir.
Here's his collar.
Jake!
Excuse me.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Frank, shut up and move this thing.
- That's him, sir!
- Halt!
Get that thing out of here!
Get it out!
Move it out!
Whoa!
- Now what do we do?
- Now you hang on.
17 times...
Um, five of...
Now cosine of...
Yeah.
Uh...
This is even better than the stuff I had last night.
What's it called?
- Tuna.
- Tuna?
Love it.
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?
According to your figures, we're going to need $120,000 worth of gold.
- So?
- So?
Jake, forgetting the money, which I can't forget, you know how much gold that is?
It's that much.
And you want to put it in a space that big?
You folks are still operating on the bulk system.
I'll reduce it to the size I need and still retain all its properties.
- How?
- I'll get into that later.
First buy the gold.
Buy it?
Jake, in order to buy $120,000's worth of gold, you need $120,000.
- So?
Is that a problem?
- A prob...?
My entire capital is tied up in my next paycheck.
- Then what's the alternative?
- I don't know what...
Hi.
- Traditionally known in horse racing...
- Oh, boy.
- What are you doing?
- Borrowing your TV.
Just bring me a beer and forget I'm here.
Hi, Jake.
Link...
Wife's worked out an equitable TV schedule.
The Peachtree Derby and the football game's on your set, and the opera on mine.
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Doing what... playing with your pussycat?
- Link...
- Franklin, please.
I've got a bundle bet on the Peachtree.
We've got problems to solve, things to do.
What?
- Link, I'm gonna have to ask you...
- Sshh!
They're at the post.
You want a peanut?
No.
- Come on, Sweet Jake.
Let's go.
- Sweet Jake?
Yeah.
It's a hunch bet.
100 on the nose at 15 to 1.
I tell you, if she comes in, tiger, and I'm gonna be 1500 in front, and you'll be licking mackerel fillet.
Did you forget my beer or did I drink it already?
Never mind, I'll get it.
- I'll try to get rid of him.
- Wait a minute.
Did you hear what he said?
If Sweet Jake finishes first, he wins $1500.
- So?
- So if Link can win $1500, why can't we win 120,000?
No.
Wait a minute.
He just made a bet.
He could win 1500.
It doesn't mean he will.
With me on his side, he will.
- Did you say something?
- Hmm?
No, nothing.
OK, OK.
Let's pipe down.
I got 100 big ones riding on this nag.
And they're off.
It's Denny's Doll breaking on top.
Attaboy Star.
Daddy's Poppa on the outside.
- Booky Baby on the rail and...
- Where's Sweet Jake?
Sweet Jake is still in the gate.
At the clubhouse turn.
It's Denny's Doll by half a length.
Attaboy Star.
Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate.
Sweet Jake is moving.
He's way behind.
But he's moving.
Uh-oh.
I think he stopped to have lunch.
I don't believe this.
Eat on your own time!
See what I mean?
Sweet Jake!
I should have bet on the Metropolitan Opera.
It's Attaboy Star by a length.
Booky Baby.
Denny's Doll and Seabottom.
Sweet Jake's finished eating and started running.
And.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Is he running.
But not even Silky Sullivan could come from this far behind.
It's Booky Baby taking the lead.
Daddy's Poppa moving into second.
Attaboy Star.
And making up incredible ground is Sweet Jake.
I have never seen anything like this.
But can he catch the pack?
At the top of the stretch.
It's Booky Baby in the lead.
Daddy's Poppa.
And turning for home.
It's Sweet Jake.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Give him the whip, dummy.
Attaboy.
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Jake.
Attaway.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Come on, boy!
That's it!
Hot dog!
We got it!
Yahoo!
Yeeha!
The story here today.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Is Sweet Jake.
1500 smackeroos!
That calls for another beer.
- How about you?
I'm buying.
- No, thanks.
Oh, incidentally, Frank, you could use another six-pack.
I got a feeling I'm gonna murder them on the football games.
Frank, that's the solution to the money.
- No, no.
It's ridiculous.
It won't work.
- Why won't it?
I don't know anything about placing a bet.
I wouldn't know where to go, what to do.
I gotta call Ernie with my football bets.
The Rams-Patriot game starts in 25 minutes.
- We'll have to take in another partner.
- Who?
- Him.
- Did you say something, Frank?
- Link?
Do you think that's wise?
- What's wise?
Who are you talking to?
Ask how many football games we can bet on.
- Who are you talking to?
- Ask him!
- It's crazy.
- Buddy?
- Who?
- How many football games on TV today?
Three pro games.
East, Midwest, Far West.
Who?
- Brief him.
- Have you got a tape machine going?
I don't think it's a good idea, but OK.
You know, I'd say you were talking to the cat.
I was.
Right.
Look, Frank, this can happen to anybody in government service.
That's why they have staff psychiatrists.
- Link.
Take a deep breath.
- OK.
- Remember that artichoke?
- Uh-huh.
Well, it all started when this spaceship...
- Spaceship?
... from another galaxy landed in a field.
Frank, let me get this straight, OK?
Now, you're trying to tell me that your little pussycat came from another planet from another galaxy in a spacecraft and landed on Earth?
- Is that it?
- That's right.
- You're squeezing.
- See?
You heard him talk.
Uh-huh.
Look.
I mean, I don't know how you're doing your little trick, you know.
But I gotta tell you something, it's dumb.
Very dumb.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna drink your last beer, watch three football games on your television set, and then I'm going home, because this is dumb, Frank.
Real dumb.
Now, that's dumb.
Aw, Link, look.
Listen to me for one minute.
I don't want to hear it, Frank.
I don't want to hear it, Frank!
- OK?
- OK.
Thank you.
That does it, Frank!
I'm going home and watch the Metropolitan Opera.
Oh, now, Link.
We need your help.
Jake needs your help!
I don't want to hear about it!
You're the only person I know who knows how to place a bet.
I don't anything about...
What kind of a spaceship?
You're beautiful.
You're down 200, sucker.
Would you like to double it?
Earnest Ernie's Sporting Club.
Weasel speaking.
What's your pleasure?
Yeah.
Give me four balls.
I'll double it.
- What do you say, Sarasota Slim?
- I say give him five.
The man says give him five.
You got it.
Honest Harry holds.
Link, can you make it fast?
We got a hot one on the rotisserie.
- Can I trust him?
- Would a crook be named Honest Harry?
You wanna bet what?
Hold on.
- Hey, Ernie.
Ernie, come here.
- Yeah.
Link wants to take his winnings from Sweet Jake and parlay the three football games.
You're kidding?
A three-game parlay?
Yeah.
It'll come to 120 G's if he makes it.
It's like taking candy from a baby, Weasel.
- He's down.
- You're down.
Hold it right there.
General?
General?
Fingerprints, sir.
They found fingerprints.
On top of the hull, inside the cabin.
And they are the prints of a human being.
So whatever power brought this ship here was aided by some disloyal American.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with a collaborator.
I want the face that matches these prints.
Use the computer.
- Double pronto, sir.
- General!
General!
- Look at this.
They found more.
- What in blazes is that?
Fine hair, sir.
The pilot was wearing a fur coat.
Even more important, we found tiny prints in a claw-like pattern, like a pussycat's.
Pussycat?
Why aren't I hearing some tickety-tacks?
What about the fingerprints?
- There's a printout about to come through.
- Sir.
What do you want me to do with this?
- Get it checked, sir.
- Coming through, sir.
"ID
- Wilson, Frank.
Doctor.
Social Security, 631-07-0829."
"1951 to '55.
US Navy.
'55 to '62 Caltech. "
"Current employment, theoretician. " ERL?
!
- That's my Dr. Wilson!
- The scoundrel.
We'll have him in the slammer within the hour.
And blow the whole ball game?
Gentlemen, we're after Mr. Big, and this double-crossing fink is gonna lead us to him.
To find the rat, tail the cat.
- Cat?
- It's just an expression.
- Want a peanut, Jake?
- No, thanks.
I'll wait till Frank gets back.
- The Rams still ahead?
- Ahead?
The Rams won the game.
And without Jake's help.
Without your help, buddy.
Let's open the six-pack.
What will you have, Jake?
- Did you get some more of that tuna?
- Yeah, yeah.
Coming right up.
There's the two-minute warning.
Oilers leading 21- 19.
Houston driving.
Another one in the bag.
- Come in.
- Frank?
Uh-huh?
Hi.
Lucybelle insisted on coming, too.
- Coming?
- Yeah, the picnic.
Oh, the picnic.
- Beer, Liz?
- No, thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- Uh...
- Is his croup worse?
- Whose?
- Jake's.
- Oh.
Yeah.
Right.
I was up all night.
- Really?
- It's gone into hyperzemia.
What's hyperzemia?
- It's what Jake's got.
- What did your doctor do for him?
- Gave him two aspirin.
- Two aspirin?
- What's that?
What's happening, Frank?
- I don't know.
Two aspirin.
No wonder you're feeling worse.
- How did he get the ball?
- Interception.
- What this cat needs is some expert help.
- Get him.
- Dr. Wenger.
- Get him.
OK.
I'll go get him.
I'll be right back.
Get him.
Somebody tackle him.
- Hi, sweetie.
Can I get you anything?
- OK.
Out of bounds on the 30.
Jake, why didn't you do something?
And spoil everybody's fun?
Look, guys, there's plenty of time.
You've got terrific whiskers.
Jake, will you pay attention?
They're within field-goal range.
If they make it, we're sunk.
No problem.
Believe me.
A little tuna, sweetheart?
Oh, Jake, concentrate, please.
The next few seconds could be crucial.
- Time out.
- I appreciate it, Doctor.
At least you could have waited till the game was over.
I have $10 on Chicago.
- You've got it on.
What's happening?
- Time out.
This is Dr. Wenger.
Dr. Wenger, here's the patient.
I definitely think he needs your attention.
All right.
- How did they get to the 30?
- Interception.
- Happened while we were in the elevator.
- ... or a field goal?
What do you think?
- I think they should try for a field goal.
- About the cat.
Hmm?
Oh, he's tense, he's very tense.
The shoulder muscles are all bunched up.
- Where do you want to examine him?
- Right here will be fine.
OK.
Let me get this out of the way.
Also, let's, first thing, get this collar off.
Hey!
Good thinking, Chicago.
This year.
He's never missed inside the 35-yard line.
- Get through that line now.
- That guy can't kick a ball 60 yards.
Block that kick.
Block that kick.
Will you calm down now?
Hold the cat, please.
Jake, you better do something.
- Where's his collar?
- Block that...
- It's right here, Frank.
- Huh?
- Give it to me, Liz.
Give it to me.
- Frank, I'm just gonna hold the...
- I'm gonna give him a sedative.
- No, don't do that!
Frank, let go of the cat.
There's the snap.
It's down.
The kick is up.
It's long enough.
It's straight enough.
It's...
It's...
It's flat!
I've never seen anything like it.
The ball flattened out in midair.
There's the gun.
- Jake?
- The Oilers have won it 21- 19.
I told you not to do that!
I only came here as a favor to a neighbor.
As a rule, I do not make house calls.
You sure picked a dumb time to break your rule.
Dr. Link!
Look, Dr. Wenger, please forgive him.
He's a new cat-owner.
Jake.
Jake, it's me, Jake.
Oh, Frank, we're finished.
He's blotto.
Well, look on the bright side.
San Diego could still win.
Yeah, and San Diego could still lose.
And where does that leave this poor little guy?
He's blown his rendezvous and my 1500 clams.
That was very rude, Frank.
- Liz, butt out.
- What?
- Cancel the bet.
Call Ernie.
- He'll never buy it.
- Look, what's going on here?
- Jake, we got problems.
Speak to me.
Is everybody crazy?
The line is busy.
We'll never get through.
He's taking bets.
- We'd better get down there.
- Like yesterday.
Just a minute, Frank.
I would like...
No, I demand an explanation.
What's going on?
- Later, Liz.
- No.
Now.
We have got exactly six minutes before that game starts.
- Watch it, Link.
I'm a black belt.
- OK.
We'll tell you in the elevator.
Remember that meeting we had with Dr. Heffel and General Stilton at the ERL?
Outer space?
- Frank Wilson, are you putting me on?
- No, no.
Remember that artichoke?
Dydee One calling Hopscotch.
Come in, Big Cheese.
This is Big Cheese.
Go ahead, Dydee One.
Do you still have contact with the subject?
Yes, sir.
Also that garbage expert and the dame from the car pool.
And they're all going into Earnest Ernie's pool hall.
Looks like a Mafia tie-in.
Mafia?
What kind of an operation you running down there, Heffel?
Lucky!
Really lucky.
Ernie?
Ernie?
Excuse me.
Ernie?
- Hi, Ernie.
- Well, look who's here.
Hiya, Doc.
Uh, Ernie,
I wanna cancel my Chargers bet.
- You wanna cancel your Chargers bet?
- Yeah, cancel my Chargers bet.
Really?
Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Just a hunch, sort of.
Hey, not a bad hunch.
The Chargers are ten points behind.
Already?
16, boss, 16.
Steelers just scored another one.
Sorry, Doc.
Is he taking a nap?
- Yeah.
- Is that TV picture still out?
Well, there goes 120,000.
1500 of which is mine.
- Isn't there anything you can do?
- Not while Jake is out.
Jake, wake up.
- Is he breathing?
- He's snoring.
OK.
OK.
Isn't there anything else we can bet on?
Yeah.
Maybe we could get lucky.
Another football game?
- Next Sunday.
- Basketball?
- Tuesday night.
- Hockey?
- Hockey?
- Hockey.
Ernie, is there a hockey game today that we could put a few bucks on?
Sorry.
Horse race?
Boxing?
- Demolition derby?
Anything to get even.
- No.
But if you want a little action, there's always my good friend Sarasota Slim.
- Sarasota Slim?
- Yes.
He indulges occasionally in a friendly pool game with a slight wager on the side.
- Nothing doing.
- Why not?
- He's a hustler.
- Who isn't?
OK.
It's a bet.
What are the odds?
You against Sarasota Slim?
- Right.
- Frank.
Because I want to give you a chance to break even and because I like your style, let's say 8 to 1.
That's all?
What about him?
- Me?
- Link?
Well, considering the shape he's in, I'd say maybe 10 to 1.
- Ohh.
What about the lady?
- Me?
- Liz?
- Considering the shape she's in, 20 to 1.
- OK.
You got a bet.
- Frank!
Arch, set 'em up.
Another sucker just swam into the net.
Frank, I don't know anything about this game.
Are you bananas?
That guy can make a pool ball sit up and do the boogaloo.
I know, but I've got the equalizer...
the collar.
- How are you gonna do that?
Jake's out.
- I've used it, to repair the spaceship.
- You?
- Yes.
I've flown.
Charlie, give me the special, and heavy on the onions.
- Taking a nap?
- Yeah.
Throw in a few chilli peppers, huh?
- Frank, I don't want to take the risk...
- Liz, you've got to do it.
I'm desperate.
No money, no gold.
No gold, no liftoff.
But...
But if we deliver, look what we get in return... the solution to half the problems on this planet.
- Just show me how to hold the pole.
- Good girl.
We need a stake.
I've got about 12 bucks.
It's in my hip pocket.
Will you get it for me?
- OK, that's 12.
How much do you have?
- Me?
I think I got 20.
- 20?
Liz?
- Uh...
- I just have my mad money.
- Give it to us.
Please?
Come on.
Boy, when this dame gets mad, she gets mad.
I was going to buy a whole spring wardrobe, Link.
- OK.
Ernie.
- Boss, here's the bankroll.
- Ernie, we bet 300 at 20 to 1.
- Check.
Not in your lifetime, Ernie.
Honest Harry holds.
All right, you want Honest Harry, you got Honest Harry.
300 at 20 to 1.
That's 6,000 clams.
And here's our 300.
Earnest Ernie, 6,000.
The mark, 300.
6300.
And may the best man win.
Or woman, as the case may be.
Young lady, it's your break.
Come on, don't be so stingy with the onions.
Here, take the collar, Liz.
OK, here.
Link, keep your eye on him.
If he blinks just once...
Miss?
Do you mind?
We're waiting.
Now, that's a sandwich.
Right?
Right.
- Taking a nap.
- Naturally.
Nice break, young lady.
Very nice.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink anything, but there's always tomorrow.
Show her how to do it.
OK, Slim, go get her.
Ooh, I can't watch this.
- Frank, I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.
Attaway, Slim.
Attaway, baby.
I guess we are licked.
If only Jake hadn't got knocked out...
Frank!
Frank, look.
Jake!
Jake?
Frank, he must have just woke up.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Yeah.
Where am I?
What happened?
I'm Liz Bartlett.
I'm responsible for your being...
- Liz, Liz, sshh.
- Oh, well.
Jake, we have got to win this pool game.
That's money in the bank.
Look at it!
Honest Harry, guess who's here?
Ernie?
Here's our last 60 bucks.
What are the odds now?
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.
- No bet.
- No bet?
It's part of my code of ethics.
Always leave the sucker rent money.
That's not fair!
Honest Harry?
If the mark wants to go complete top city, he's got a constitutional right.
And I stand on it.
The odds, Ernie?
It's ridiculous.
But if I didn't have no principles, I'd say 100 to 1.
Suppose...
Suppose she gives Sarasota Slim 12 balls?
What a sense of humor!
300 to 1.
- And the break.
- The break?
500 to 1.
And blindfolded.
- What?
- Blindfolded!
- 2,000 to 1.
- You're on.
$60 at 2,000 to 1.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Are you seriously serious?
- You're not thinking of welching, are you?
- But I thought you was putting me on.
Earnest Ernie, it would not do your reputation any credit if word was to circulate that you reneged on a wager duly offered and accepted.
- Get the big bundle, Weasel.
- But, boss...
Get it!
All right.
Let me understand this.
Slim gets 12 balls and the break?
And she shoots blindfolded.
She'll never get to the table.
120 Gs, boss.
Don't put it away, Honest Harry, you ain't gonna hold it long.
All right, Slim.
Show 'em no mercy.
Nice.
Nice break, Slim.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink nothing, but there's always tomorrow.
- I believe I'm up.
- Hold it.
Blindfolded.
Oh.
Could you back off?
You did it, Jake.
You did it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It was really nothing.
Thank you.
Frank, we won!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, all of you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about things being upside down, but I took these pictures at risk of life and limb.
There's the cat, sir.
Notice his collar?
Well, well.
What did you think of it, Mr. Olympus?
It's just mind-boggling, isn't it?
I mean, it boggled my mind.
Did it boggle yours, sir?
Thank you, Omar.
Yes, Mr. Stallwood, you are quite correct.
It is "mind-boggling," as you so graphically put it.
The possibilities are infinite.
A revolution in transportation, space exploration, colonizing the planets.
The man who owns the secret of this device could control...
The world, sir?
The universe.
Oh, my!
Well, then, sir, I don't suppose it would be out of place to suggest a bonus.
- A bonus?
- A small bonus.
Mr. Stallwood, if I gain the secret of that device, you may well become a very rich man.
I may?
Oh, sir, I... really may?
Omar, prepare the copter.
We leave at once.
I must have that collar.
I will have that collar.
OK.
All set, General.
- Is it programmed?
- All the pertinent information fed in.
- Everything we know.
- Question number one, sir.
Question number one.
Who is the pilot?
It is a pussycat!
This machine is having a nervous breakdown.
Get on the ball, young man.
Feed that information through again.
Reassess.
Yes, sir.
- General Stilton, sir.
- What is it, Sergeant?
That purchase Dr. Link made... we checked it out.
It's a large quantity of gold.
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.
It's a Machiavellian conspiracy.
Radio.
This is Big Cheese calling Dydee One.
Where are you, Dydee One?
Outside the suspect's apartment.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Another printout, General.
Of all the...
Wait a minute.
Radio.
- Dydee One.
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't they carry a cat into that pool hall?
- Yes, sir, they did.
Gentlemen, it's time to move in.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
$120,000 in one lump sum.
Jake, how'd you like to hang around and watch me parlay this into a fortune?
- I wish I could hang around.
- I'm sorry, Jake.
The time?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, Lucy.
- I guess I'd better reduce the gold.
- Reduce it?
- What are you talking about?
- It's a new concept in calculating mass.
On Jake's planet, they use a system based on content, rather than on the quantitative...
Frank!
You've got a whole lifetime to explain that.
I've got less than an hour.
Now, stand back, everybody.
- All right, don't move!
All hands in the air!
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Frank Wilson?
- You can't butt in here!
- Dr. Frank Wilson, you are under arrest.
- And the pussycat, General.
And the pussycat.
- Read them their rights, Colonel.
- Captain?
- Sergeant?
- Never mind.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right...
- Good heavens.
- Frank...
- What happened?
- They're frozen.
Holy mackerel!
Now they're on to us, how are we to get into Hopscotch?
You can't zap the whole base.
- Yeah, well, I'll think of something.
- They'll probably be on alert.
First things first.
Let's get this gold reduced, then we'll worry about getting on the base.
Now stand back.
OK.
Here goes.
Ohh.
That is unbelievable.
Oh, Jake.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.
I think I've got the perfect way to get us onto the base.
Maybe we ought to give 'em a buzz.
Think we ought to give 'em a buzz?
Yeah, give 'em a buzz.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in.
Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
- What's the military doing here?
- This could be complicated, sir.
What isn't?
- Get that door closed!
- Uh-oh.
What does it all mean?
It means it's exceptionally complicated.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Ah, here comes General Cheese.
I mean, Stilton.
- Wait.
Hold Jake for a minute.
- Yes.
- How do I look?
- Could you hold Lucy for a minute?
- Do I look like a general?
- Oh, well...
Frank, you look very commanding.
- That'll have to do.
Let's go.
- OK.
He got the cat.
That's the cat!
Where's the general going with those two?
That's the general?
It's not?
Open your door!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Halt!
Halt in the name of the US...
Fantastic.
- Listen, good luck, huh?
- Yeah.
Be careful.
- Bye, Lucybelle.
Thanks for everything.
- Yeah, yeah.
Let's go.
Bye.
- They've escaped?
- Yes.
But, fortunately for us, they left something very valuable behind.
- General Stilton?
- Of course!
Of course.
I'll sign you in, sir.
General Stilton and cat.
Is the cat cleared, sir?
- What do you think?
- Sorry, sir.
I want the hangar open.
All personnel out.
We're moving the ship.
But sir, if we order 'em out of the hangar, how are you gonna...
- Soldier!
- Out of the hangar, sir.
Yes, sir.
Get the hangar doors open.
All personnel out of the hangar on the double.
- First, let's get the ship out of the hangar.
- Check.
...to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you're being...
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Hold it right here, Frank.
130 to countdown.
Hurry.
Insert the gold in the microtransformer.
Right, right.
- Got it.
- Good.
Now let's see if we have contact.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
- Where's the microphone?
- Frank!
OK, OK.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
Hi there.
Fella.
See you made it with nothing to spare.
- We had problems.
- We are 105 to liftoff.
Coming in on ray 0392.
Adjust transmuter.
- Adjustment made.
- Countdown starts at 20.
Set clinometer.
- Clinometer set.
Give me a printout.
- Coming your way without delay.
- That's another cat?
- Oh, yeah.
A real mother.
- I gotta get to that spaceship right away.
- Who are you?
A friend of Frank Wil...
I mean General Stilton.
A very good friend.
Let's go.
Open the gate.
My car!
- Them, too.
- Never mind.
Let's get down to Hopscotch.
- Sergeant.
- Captain.
Colonel.
- General.
- Oh, get in!
- Counting down.
- Hey, Frank!
Hold it, sir, right there.
General, this man says...
Hey!
You're not General Stilton.
- Frank.
- What are you doing here?
Frank, it's a nightmare.
Liz has been captured by Stallwood.
Have you been hitting the beer?
Stallwood of Supplies?
He's an agent for some guy named Olympus, a power-crazed creep who's...
- He's holding her for ransom.
- Lucybelle, too?
Yeah, he wants that collar, Jake.
It's the collar or Liz.
- Where is she?
- I'm going with you, Frank.
No, no, you don't want to get stuck here on Earth.
You're responsible to your mission.
- But I'm the reason for the mess they're in.
- Do you know where they're taking her?
- Place called Dailey's Airport.
- Do you know where it is?
Let's go.
- Frank...
- Jake, you're going home.
Now, get in there.
So long, buddy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
5. 4 3. 2.
Ignite.
Bye, Jake.
Drop us a card.
OK, you clowns.
Let's move it.
Let's go.
Jake!
Jake, this is insane.
You're here forever, on Earth.
You're wasting time.
The airport!
General, look!
Good heavens!
That's my car.
Get the police on the radio.
- Hello, Sequoia?
- Turn around!
Here comes a car.
It's Wilson.
Yeah, and Link.
And the cat!
They're here.
They've come.
Naturally.
You knew they would.
You knew it.
We've won.
Now they will have turn over the cat and we will turn over the girl.
We will?
We won't?
It may be difficult to explain your part in this after the young lady's gone to the police.
Oh, dear.
You wouldn't dare?
Frank, that must be the chopper.
It's the police, sir.
It's a trap.
The fools!
Get us airborne.
Watch it!
- They're getting away!
- Yeah.
But look who's arriving - the army and the police.
We have to follow that copter.
What kind of an airport is this?
Where are the planes?
Follow me.
Oh, you can't fly this, Jake.
It's a wreck.
Look at that propeller - it's half gone.
- Are you coming or staying?
- I'm coming.
I'm staying.
OK, tovarisch.
Ponimayete po-russki?
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
- Parlez-vous français?
- What?
- All right, Dr. Garbage Expert.
Who's your accomplice?
Who's flying that plane?
Uh...
General, you're not gonna believe this.
There they are.
- It's Wilson and the cat.
- How did they get that wreck in the air?
The power that cat possesses is awesome.
You betcha, Charlie, and if you know what's good for you, you'll land...
- Quiet!
- OK.
Faster, Omar, faster.
Get close.
Use the collar to force them to land.
No chance.
It's taking all I got just to keep this crate flying.
Don't panic.
We'll think of something.
What's happening?
Why aren't they doing something?
Of course!
They're afraid of harming the girl.
Turn on them, Omar.
The advantage is ours.
What's happening?
Why are they turning around?
Straight at them, Omar.
Drive them down.
Frank!
Jake!
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake.
Jake.
Turn this thing over.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake.
Jake!
Frank, are you OK?
- What are they trying to do?
- Force us down.
They probably figured out that we've got a problem.
Hold on.
Here they come.
- They're still on our tail.
- Don't panic.
On top of them, Omar.
Smash them down!
Whoa!
I see 'em.
I see 'em.
Look out.
Jake!
Jake!
- Here they come again.
Jake.
- Yeah, yeah.
Fruitcake.
Frank, watch out!
Jake, Jake.
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
Jake.
Oh, dear.
Jake.
Break off!
Buzz them again, Omar, and this time, everybody open fire.
- What happened?
- You happened, you imbecile!
- How bad is it, Omar?
- He got the controls.
They're locked.
When the fuel runs out, we're through.
Shall we bail out?
We have no choice.
Bail out?
Where are you going?
I haven't got a parachute, either.
- Then you have a problem.
- I haven't got a parachute either.
Then you have the same problem.
Wait!
No, wait!
Wait a minute!
I d...
I don't want to die!
Oh, swell.
Frank!
Frank!
Yes, Mr. President.
Absolutely, Mr. President.
We're just waiting for them to land and we'll pass that on.
- Yes, sir.
- What'd he say?
Jake is to be treated as the representative of a friendly power, with generous borrowing credit.
In exchange for bases, of course.
Look, sir, chutes.
They bailed out.
Holy mackerel!
Who's flying the chopper?
Frank!
Easy, Liz.
Don't panic.
- What are you gonna do, Frank?
- I don't know, but I have to do something.
Hand me Lucybelle!
- Careful, Frank!
- I got her.
- Just hold on, honey, and we'll get Liz.
- Get us up closer to the copter.
Right.
Liz, when we get close enough, grab my hand.
Frank, you're too far away!
Closer, Jake.
Closer!
Grab my hand, Liz.
Grab it!
Grab it!
Liz, careful.
- OK.
- Now grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Good.
That's good.
That's good.
- Now grab my hand and step off.
- Step off?
- Liz!
- Huh?
Ohh...
- Frank, I don't think this is gonna work.
- All right.
We'll try it again.
Never mind.
We'll try something else.
- All right, put your feet on my shoulders.
- What?
Put your feet right there, on my shoulders.
No!
Liz, do it!
OK.
OK.
- Oh...
Oh...
Ohh!
- Whoa!
You see?
Everything's gonna be OK, Lucybelle.
Just relax.
Jake!
Jake, what are you doing?
You know, when I saw you up in that chopper, I just...
Huh?
Well, honey, looks like you're stuck with me.
Don't just hang there.
Get me out of this.
- Don't worry.
I'll get you loose.
- What are you doing with that?
Fortunately, I never go anywhere without my Swiss Army knife.
Idiot!
All rise.
Hear ye.

(whirring sound overhead)
(clucking)
(neighing)
(chickens clucking/cows mooing)
What is it?
What is that light?
I don't know.
(banging)
You stay right here, Edna.
Don't leave the house.
I'm gonna take a look at it.
Come on, Dutch.
(whimpers)
Chicken.
Holy mackerel!
(male voice) This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in.
Mother Ship.
This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
(female voice) This is Mother Ship.
Have you completed emergency landing?
Affirmative.
Mother.
Request repair party.
Negative.
Zunar J5.
You'll have to effect emergency repairs yourself.
And rendezvous with us at grid dissect 8304 at 69 hours minus 17.
- That's an awfully tight squeeze.
- Unavoidable.
Zunar.
Next mission to this galaxy due in 115.
- Days?
- Years.
Good luck.
Zunar J5.
Over and out.
Yeah.
So long.
Mother.
(whistles)
I don't see any hammer and sickle, do you, Colonel?
Maybe it's on the inside, General.
No sign of life, either.
Get me the Pentagon, red priority.
I want to speak to the chiefs, Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Sequoia here.
Come in, Rover.
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
(General) Wipe it out of your minds.
You've seen nothing and heard nothing.
- Yes, sir.
- We'll want them later.
Take their names.
Colonel.
Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Names?
- Charlie Cooney.
General Stilton!
We're ready when you are, sir.
- Bullhorn.
- Yes, sir.
On to Hopscotch.
All right, men.
Let's move it!
- Let's move out.
Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
(electronic beeping)
(collar beeps)
(General) When we get to Hopscotch, I want mark-four priority security.
Armor, personnel, guard dogs, the works.
And not one word to public relations.
Not one word.
You got that, Colonel?
Yes, sir.
You got that, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
Sergeant?
- Got it.
Well?
It's a brilliant technological achievement.
It's state of the art.
You trying to tell me something, Allison?
- It's definitely not one of ours, General.
- How about Russia?
Certainly not Russia.
It's far beyond...
OK, Allison.
Lay it on the line.
Whose is it?
I don't know, General.
We'd better find out.
I wanna know who made it, flew it and where it came from.
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Contact SigCom on our radio.
Get Hungerford at Air.
Call Steinmetz at Johns Hopkins, Lasser, Billings, Cranhammer.
- Get them IQs off their tennis courts.
- Yes, sir.
Double pronto!
If we don't find out where that thing came from, this country could be in trouble, big, big trouble.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
You say it's not man-made, Allison.
What's that leave us?
Outer space.
With no sign of the pilot.
Big, big trouble.
While you and I are talking this very minute, some slimy green-headed 12-legged creep could be crawling into the White House.
Big, big trouble.
We're up against genius.
We'd better come up with some genius of our own.
(man) I believe, General, you've already met my assistant, Dr. Corday.
I'd like to introduce some members of our team.
Dr. Robeson of Caltech, who's our expert on fossil fuel.
Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins.
Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett, who heads Thermal.
Huh.
Dr. Norman Link, who's been doing some intriguing work in garbage research.
- So what?
- Dr. Link.
Just a second, Dr. Heffel.
I have to relay some vital information to a colleague.
Oh, yes.
This is our hard-water man, Dr. Leach.
Right, Ernie.
The Lakers by a point and a half for 100 bucks.
When will you have the line on Philly and the New York Knicks?
(Heffel) I'd like you to meet Mr. Jurist, who also is involved in Thermal.
And there's Dr. Banford, Professor Epstein, Doctors Davidson and Barrett.
And, of course, this is Dr. Humphrey, our head of Nuclear.
Mr. Stallwood, our head of Procurement and Supplies.
What are you doing here?
When the call went out for an emergency meeting, I naturally assumed...
You assumed wrong.
Scientists.
Double-A clearance only.
Out.
- But I might have a contribution.
- If we need any pencils, I'll send for you.
- But, Dr. Heffel...
- Out.
Sorry, General.
Where was I?
Oh, yes.
Professor...
Dr. Heffel, I didn't come for a roll call, I came to pick brains.
Are they all here?
- Yes.
These are our top people.
- Then let's get to it!
I understand, General.
Attention, everyone.
(Heffel) Dr. Link.
That's it, Professor.
I'll call tomorrow with more input.
Bye.
All right, Sergeant.
Open it.
Drapes.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is top secret.
The United States government will countenance no leaks.
Now.
What's holding it up?
- Nothing.
- It's amazing.
- Where did you get it?
- What is it?
(man) A propulsion unit of some sort, ladies and gentlemen.
Never mind where we got it.
We have other experts working on that.
What we want to know from you is, what makes it tick?
OK.
Let's have your hypothesis.
Uh, the energy source could be atomic.
We've checked on that.
Negative.
Direct conversion, utilizing thermionic...
- Checked out.
Negative.
- Oh.
It's not propelled by garbage, I know that.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Come in, Olympus.
Mr. Olympus?
This is Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something very big and very...
Jellyfish.
Your man in ERL?
Yes, sir.
That Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something.
No, sir.
I think you'll find this a great deal more interesting than my last report.
Right now, Dr. Heffel is in a secret meeting with a four-star general and a whole gaggle of scientists.
What are they meeting about?
I don't know, sir, it's a secret.
Get in there and find out?
Do any of you have a solid evaluation?
Not a guess, a solid premise?
Do you?
Well?
(clears throat)
Do you think it might be fruitful to bring Dr. Wilson into this discussion, Dr. Heffel?
- Wilson?
- Yes.
He might very well come up with an applicable theory.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Who's Dr. Wilson?
- He's in my carpool.
Oh...
That is, we live in the same building.
- That certainly qualifies him.
- Oh.
No.
What I'm trying to say is, he's a very bright young physicist who's come here recently on loan from Caltech.
A loan, I might add, that is bearing absolutely no interest.
(laughter)
He's a little unorthodox, but a brilliant theorist.
- General Stilton isn't interested in...
- Get him.
- What?
- Get him.
His output couldn't be any less than what we've gotten so far.
Yes, General.
He really has an unusual mind.
- Well, Dr. Wilson?
- It's beautiful.
Don't you have any other observation?
- Only that it looks like an artichoke.
- We know it looks like an artichoke.
What makes it tick?
Mayonnaise?
Negative.
No, I was only joking, sir.
I do have a theory, sir, actually, in line with the work I've been doing.
I have a hunch it's tapping the primal mainstream.
The primal mainstream?
It's everywhere, only on different frequencies.
The whole electromagnetic spectrum -
Cosmic, gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, radio waves.
Do you know how much we finite human beings can tune into with our senses?
Less than five percent.
The universe makes its own energy.
We even make it ourselves.
Yes, take biofeedback, for instance.
If I taped terminals to your head, General, your brain could run an electric train.
- Electric train?
- (Heffel) I'm sorry, General.
Perhaps electric train wasn't the most apt example.
(Heffel) Thank you very much.
- Let me have that for a couple of months...
- Thank you.
A couple of months?
Dr. Heffel?
- Yes, General?
- I want action.
(bell rings)
You know, Drexel, I've seen the most amazing thing.
Amazing.
But don't ask me to tell you about it.
It's classified.
(bell rings)
Thank you, Drexel.
Well.
How did you get in here?
Huh?
Now look, you're asking for trouble.
Dr. Heffel isn't too crazy about animals in the building.
Fact is, he isn't too crazy about people in the building either.
What's your name, huh?
Charlie?
Cuddles?
Jake?
Yes, yes.
You look like Jake.
That, Jake, is the Van Allen belt.
Oil and coal is not going to do it, you know.
And, one of these days, that sun of ours is going to turn into a big black hole.
You know where it's really at, Jake?
Electromagnetism.
We're loaded with it.
You know, it's crazy, but you almost look like you know what I'm talking about.
All right, give me a hand with this, Sergeant.
Easy, easy.
That's it.
Stallwood, administration emergency!
That's some fancy collar you got there.
Maybe I'll take you home with me.
My neighbor Liz has a cat named Lucybelle.
She's really cute.
And the cat's not bad either.
Liz!
Hi.
Ouch!
I've...
- We were just talking about you.
- Were you?
This is Jake.
I'm going to take him home with us.
You won't have to drive Professor Link and myself home tonight.
- Heffel's called a late meeting.
- I can wait.
That won't be necessary.
- How about a coffee?
- No.
- Chocolate chip cookie?
- No.
- Are you sore or something?
- Sore?
Sore?
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- What is it?
What did I do?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Mayonnaise?
Electric trains?
Well, now, look, really, all that...
that was just a joke, Doctor.
Well, nobody laughed, especially the general.
Has he had water?
- The general?
- The cat.
Oh.
Water?
Cats do get thirsty, you know.
Do you have a bowl?
A bowl?
Right here, yes.
Here.
- Water?
- Yes, right, water.
Look, Liz...
Dr. Bartlett.
Just because some general lacks a sense of humor, that's no reason...
- All I was trying to convey...
- I'm really not interested, Doctor.
Besides, I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's just that the magnitude of what the general showed us just bowled me over.
- It did?
- Oh, completely.
- Black.
- What?
- Didn't you offer me a cup of coffee?
- Right.
Check.
Coming right up.
I really don't understand, that's all.
The man who wrote the article you did for The Scientific Quarterly...
- You read it?
- Well, of course.
It was brilliant.
I've been wanting to tell you.
We don't get much chance to talk in the car pool, but I've been following your work.
- You have?
- Closely.
It's very impressive, very innovative, very attractive.
I mean, it's bound to attract attention.
Oh, well, um,
I am writing an article at the moment and I would love to have your criticism.
Oh.
Maybe at lunch or, even better, at dinner sometime?
- Yeah, I'd like that.
When?
- Tonight?
No, that's right, you've got that late meeting.
That may not go all that late.
I should be out by seven.
Is that too late?
- Seven's beautiful.
- Good.
Well...
Oh, thanks for the coffee.
It was delicious.
- I think she digs you.
- I sure hope so.
- Who said that?
- I did.
Frank, we'd better get down to business.
Sit down.
We've gotta talk.
I'm running out of time, and you're the only one I can depend on to help me.
- It's you?
- It's not the mouse.
Now, sit down.
But your lips aren't moving.
You're not speaking.
Thought transference.
Nothing exceptional where I come from.
Now, sit.
My name is Zunar J5/9 Doric 4-7.
Zunar...?
Why don't we just stay with Jake, OK?
Frank, last night at 03 hours plus 13,
I made an emergency landing in a spaceship from another galaxy.
That so-called artichoke... it's from my craft.
But... you're a cat.
Granted.
But you see, in our civilization, that's as far as we needed to evolve.
We developed our brain to a fine point.
Now, man rose off his four legs and developed tools, machinery, agriculture and a chronic pain in his lower back.
We developed tools for the mind.
This collar here, it amplifies brain power.
- It does what?
- Well, it provides energy by which we...
Look, let me give you a demonstration.
(cello music)
- (flute plays)
- Not a bad little tune.
(humming along)
Mm-mmm.
Frank, this is really delicious.
What is it?
Oh, it's chopped kidney.
It's all they had at the deli.
It really hits the spot.
I'm gonna take a couple of cases for my trip back.
Sure beats the blah I've been eating.
Well, now back to my problem.
Frank, I need an answer.
- What do you say?
- Say about what?
Can I count on you to help me repair my spaceship?
- Why me?
- Because I like the way you think.
Your equations rather interest me.
In fact, they're really not bad at all... for a human.
- Really?
I'm on the right track?
- Quite definitely, but years away from a solution.
Frank, on my planet, we have an expression - you rub my fur, I'll rub yours.
How would you like to make a quantum jump?
You help me, and I'll give you a push in the right direction.
- You're serious?
- I'm serious.
- You really are from outer space?
- I am from outer space.
- Even though you're a cat?
- Frank!
Is it a deal?
It's a deal.
Oh, that's...
We better move.
I've got to make repairs to my ship by 5:13 Sunday for liftoff, or I'll miss the rendezvous with the mother ship.
Right.
I'll get my sweater.
Uh, do you think that you can find your way back to that airport?
No problem.
I made a memory imprint.
- With the collar?
- Right.
Fantastic.
How developed does your brain have to be to use that collar?
Not very.
In fact, you could handle it.
You wanna try?
Do we have time?
Why not?
Look, just grab hold of it.
Easy.
Don't take it off.
Without it, I'm just an average cat.
Right.
- Right.
OK?
- OK.
- Now just concentrate.
- Concentrate.
Think levitation.
Levitation.
You're as light as a feather.
Look at me.
I'm floating!
It's just plain incredible!
- Look, one hand.
- You're losing your concentration.
Yeah.
Hi, Frank.
Gotta use your set.
(commentator) The ball goes crosscourt to Brown.
He brings it...
- What were you doing up in the air?
- Uh...
- Astronaut exercises.
- Oh.
- Link, I'm busy.
- Yeah.
Well, just forget I'm here.
The last minute of the game, and Francine throws me out of the apartment.
Why does she throw me out?
For one lousy cigar burn on the chair.
- When did you get a cat?
- Jake's not my cat.
He's just visiting.
- Hi, Jake.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Do you mind, Frank?
Remember.
The score's tied at 108.
Atlanta has the ball and a basket could win it.
Win it?
Oh, man!
And I gave a point and a half.
There goes my 100 bucks.
Come on, defense.
Come on, guys.
Man to man, we'll...
The crowd is really on its feet now.
The guy in the corner.
He's alone and closely guarded by King.
King steals the ball.
What a play.
Here come the Lakers.
Five seconds left.
Puts up a shot.
But a prayer.
There's no chance.
Wait...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
I don't believe it.
He scores!
He made it in the last second.
And the Lakers will win it by two.
Unbelievable!
Frank, did you see that?
Yeah.
I'm really gonna have to ask you to leave.
- I could use another beer.
- I'm out of beer, I'm sorry.
- How about a ginger ale?
- I'm out of that, too.
- Could I at least finish my cigar?
- Link, please.
I'd like to have a little celebration.
I'll see you later.
The basketball game?
You did that?
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
It was the fastest way to get rid of that flake.
Let's go.
It's less than 36 hours to liftoff.
Right.
Oh...
Do you think I ought to carry you, so people don't suspect you're not an ordinary cat?
Good thinking, Frank.
Besides, my left paw's been acting up again.
- An old football injury?
- Actually, no.
Polo.
Now let's go.
What about getting into Hopscotch?
It'll be guarded.
- I'll handle that, too.
- It's fantastic.
Hi.
Hi, this is Lucybelle.
What'd you say you call him?
- Jake.
- Jake, right.
Jake, this is Lucybelle.
I thought they could get acquainted while we're at dinner.
- At dinner?
- Yeah.
It was tonight, wasn't it?
Right.
Right, yes.
I was just about to call you.
Something came up.
I'm afraid you're going to have to give me a rain check.
Oh.
Oh, well, of course.
It really doesn't matter.
But it does.
It matters a lot, Liz.
Dr. Bartlett.
You see, what happened was... (Jake sneezing)
It's Jake.
He took sick.
Suddenly.
Out of the blue.
Really?
What is it?
I think it's, uh, Tasmanian Croup.
(sneezing)
You poor thing.
You know, he sounds terrible.
You'd better not let her get too close.
Stop milking it.
- What?
- I said I was about to rush him to the vet's.
The vet.
That's a good idea, Frank.
D'you know there's a very good vet who lives in the building?
A Dr. Wenger.
He specializes in cats.
I'm sure he'd be glad to take a look at him.
Jake prefers a general practitioner.
I'm sorry about dinner.
I'll make it up to you.
- How about a picnic?
- Tomorrow?
- You handled that very well.
- I didn't enjoy lying to Liz.
She's a very unusual person.
- Her kitty-cat's not too bad either.
- There's plenty of time for that.
That's all right for you to say.
But I've been confined to a spaceship for five months.
Ohh... (vehicle approaches)
- (Jake) The ship's in that big hangar.
- Oh.
There's got to be a way in.
- It's locked.
- No problem.
- Come on, come on.
- Right, right.
The coast is clear.
Let's go!
There she is.
Somebody's coming.
- Somebody's coming, Frank!
- I know, I know.
What's happening?
It's all clear.
- Let's go!
- It's this way.
(dog growls)
(barks)
Forget it.
It wears off in 20 minutes.
He won't remember a thing.
Come on, let's go.
Incredible.
An older model, but in pretty good shape for a rig with nearly a trillion miles on it.
Now let's see about getting it operational again.
We've only got 34 hours left.
Right.
Through here?
Hm-hm.
Put me down.
Oh, it's just incredible.
The artichoke.
I was right.
- What's this... control panel?
- Uh-huh.
Sort of.
- And this?
- Uh, computer.
- Then this must be the readout.
- Frank, later.
I'll explain it all later, I promise.
- First, disengage the transducer system.
- How?
Take that neo-mag intercog, and you'll find the transducer switch on top of the ship.
Just coordinate with me.
Well, how do I get up there?
- Fly.
- Fly?
You mean use your collar?
Don't be ridiculous.
We carry a spare.
Concentrate, and when you get on top, engage the switch with the intercog and thought-project "seven max triad."
- Seven max triad.
- Right.
The computer will do the rest.
Seven max triad.
Right.
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hey, Frank, what are you doing up there?
What about the intercog?
Frank?
Jake, I'm ready to plug it in.
Right.
Go ahead.
- It's in.
- OK.
Thought-project.
Seven max triad.
OK, Frank.
Come on down.
Amazing.
I was afraid of that.
The focal terminal on the microtransformer's vaporized.
- You're sure?
- Positive.
But I'll double-check.
- Just what I thought.
- That's where the focal terminal goes?
Acts as a catalyzer.
I'll need a small amount of org 12.
- What's org 12?
- What the focal terminal's made of.
About six cubits ought to be enough.
You don't have org 12 on this planet?
Never heard of it.
Is it like mayonnaise?
You probably call it by a different name.
Stand back.
I'll run it through the computer.
(horn honks)
Hey, Tom!
You all right?
Tom!
Org 12...
ductile yellow metallic element.
Melting point - 1.063.
Tensile strength - 19.000.
- Tensile strength what?
- 19.000.
Atomic weight - 196.967.
Wait a minute.
That's the atomic weight of gold.
Wow!
(alarm blaring.
Bell ringing)
(soldier) Out!
Out!
Everybody out!
What is that?
Come on, let's go.
Follow me!
Holy cow.
- Give my collar room.
- You can't zap the whole base.
Let's get out of here.
Over here!
Follow me!
Move out!
Watch it!
Come back here!
(Jake) Where are you going?
Come out of there.
You're under arrest!
Look out!
- (meowing)
- What is it?
Get it off of me!
Get it off!
(soldier) Was anybody in there?
Back it out.
Look out.
Who's driving?
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!
- Yes, sir?
- Who sounded that alarm?
I did, sir.
We have an intruder, and his cat.
Cat?
Cat?
Cat?
Yes, sir.
Here's his collar.
Jake!
Excuse me.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Frank, shut up and move this thing.
- That's him, sir!
- Halt!
Get that thing out of here!
Get it out!
Move it out!
Whoa!
- Now what do we do?
- Now you hang on.
(Frank) 17 times...
Um, five of...
Now cosine of...
Yeah.
Uh...
This is even better than the stuff I had last night.
What's it called?
- Tuna.
- Tuna?
Love it.
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?
According to your figures, we're going to need $120,000 worth of gold.
- So?
- So?
Jake, forgetting the money, which I can't forget, you know how much gold that is?
It's that much.
And you want to put it in a space that big?
You folks are still operating on the bulk system.
I'll reduce it to the size I need and still retain all its properties.
- How?
- I'll get into that later.
First buy the gold.
Buy it?
Jake, in order to buy $120,000's worth of gold, you need $120,000.
- So?
Is that a problem?
- A prob...?
My entire capital is tied up in my next paycheck.
- Then what's the alternative?
- I don't know what...
Hi.
- Traditionally known in horse racing...
- Oh, boy.
- What are you doing?
- Borrowing your TV.
Just bring me a beer and forget I'm here.
Hi, Jake.
Link...
Wife's worked out an equitable TV schedule.
The Peachtree Derby and the football game's on your set, and the opera on mine.
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Doing what... playing with your pussycat?
- Link...
- Franklin, please.
I've got a bundle bet on the Peachtree.
(softly) We've got problems to solve, things to do.
What?
- Link, I'm gonna have to ask you...
- Sshh!
They're at the post.
You want a peanut?
No.
- Come on, Sweet Jake.
Let's go.
- Sweet Jake?
Yeah.
It's a hunch bet.
100 on the nose at 15 to 1.
I tell you, if she comes in, tiger, and I'm gonna be 1500 in front, and you'll be licking mackerel fillet.
Did you forget my beer or did I drink it already?
Never mind, I'll get it.
- I'll try to get rid of him.
- (softly) Wait a minute.
Did you hear what he said?
If Sweet Jake finishes first, he wins $1500.
- So?
- So if Link can win $1500, why can't we win 120,000?
No.
Wait a minute.
He just made a bet.
He could win 1500.
It doesn't mean he will.
With me on his side, he will.
- Did you say something?
- Hmm?
No, nothing.
OK, OK.
Let's pipe down.
I got 100 big ones riding on this nag.
And they're off.
It's Denny's Doll breaking on top.
Attaboy Star.
Daddy's Poppa on the outside.
- Booky Baby on the rail and...
- Where's Sweet Jake?
Sweet Jake is still in the gate.
At the clubhouse turn.
It's Denny's Doll by half a length.
Attaboy Star.
Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate.
Sweet Jake is moving.
He's way behind.
But he's moving.
Uh-oh.
I think he stopped to have lunch.
I don't believe this.
Eat on your own time!
See what I mean?
Sweet Jake!
I should have bet on the Metropolitan Opera.
It's Attaboy Star by a length.
Booky Baby.
Denny's Doll and Seabottom.
Sweet Jake's finished eating and started running.
And.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Is he running.
But not even Silky Sullivan could come from this far behind.
It's Booky Baby taking the lead.
Daddy's Poppa moving into second.
Attaboy Star.
And making up incredible ground is Sweet Jake.
I have never seen anything like this.
But can he catch the pack?
At the top of the stretch.
It's Booky Baby in the lead.
Daddy's Poppa.
And turning for home.
It's Sweet Jake.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Give him the whip, dummy.
Attaboy.
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Jake.
Attaway.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Come on, boy!
That's it!
Hot dog!
We got it!
Yahoo!
Yeeha!
The story here today.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Is Sweet Jake.
1500 smackeroos!
That calls for another beer.
- How about you?
I'm buying.
- No, thanks.
Oh, incidentally, Frank, you could use another six-pack.
I got a feeling I'm gonna murder them on the football games.
Frank, that's the solution to the money.
- No, no.
It's ridiculous.
It won't work.
- Why won't it?
I don't know anything about placing a bet.
I wouldn't know where to go, what to do.
I gotta call Ernie with my football bets.
The Rams-Patriot game starts in 25 minutes.
- We'll have to take in another partner.
- Who?
- Him.
- Did you say something, Frank?
- Link?
Do you think that's wise?
- What's wise?
Who are you talking to?
Ask how many football games we can bet on.
- Who are you talking to?
- Ask him!
- It's crazy.
- Buddy?
- Who?
- How many football games on TV today?
Three pro games.
East, Midwest, Far West.
Who?
- Brief him.
- Have you got a tape machine going?
I don't think it's a good idea, but OK.
You know, I'd say you were talking to the cat.
I was.
Right.
Look, Frank, this can happen to anybody in government service.
That's why they have staff psychiatrists.
- Link.
Take a deep breath.
- OK.
- Remember that artichoke?
- Uh-huh.
Well, it all started when this spaceship...
- Spaceship?
...from another galaxy landed in a field.
Frank, let me get this straight, OK?
Now, you're trying to tell me that your little pussycat came from another planet from another galaxy in a spacecraft and landed on Earth?
- Is that it?
- That's right.
- You're squeezing.
- See?
You heard him talk.
Uh-huh.
Look.
I mean, I don't know how you're doing your little trick, you know.
But I gotta tell you something, it's dumb.
Very dumb.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna drink your last beer, watch three football games on your television set, and then I'm going home, because this is dumb, Frank.
Real dumb.
Now, that's dumb.
Aw, Link, look.
Listen to me for one minute.
I don't want to hear it, Frank.
I don't want to hear it, Frank!
- OK?
- OK.
Thank you.
That does it, Frank!
I'm going home and watch the Metropolitan Opera.
Oh, now, Link.
We need your help.
Jake needs your help!
I don't want to hear about it!
You're the only person I know who knows how to place a bet.
I don't anything about...
What kind of a spaceship?
You're beautiful.
(phone rings)
You're down 200, sucker.
Would you like to double it?
Earnest Ernie's Sporting Club.
Weasel speaking.
What's your pleasure?
Yeah.
Give me four balls.
I'll double it.
- What do you say, Sarasota Slim?
- I say give him five.
The man says give him five.
You got it.
Honest Harry holds.
Link, can you make it fast?
We got a hot one on the rotisserie.
- Can I trust him?
- Would a crook be named Honest Harry?
You wanna bet what?
Hold on.
- Hey, Ernie.
Ernie, come here.
- Yeah.
Link wants to take his winnings from Sweet Jake and parlay the three football games.
You're kidding?
A three-game parlay?
Yeah.
It'll come to 120 G's if he makes it.
It's like taking candy from a baby, Weasel.
- He's down.
- You're down.
(man) Hold it right there.
General?
General?
Fingerprints, sir.
They found fingerprints.
On top of the hull, inside the cabin.
And they are the prints of a human being.
So whatever power brought this ship here was aided by some disloyal American.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with a collaborator.
I want the face that matches these prints.
Use the computer.
- Double pronto, sir.
- General!
General!
- Look at this.
They found more.
- What in blazes is that?
Fine hair, sir.
The pilot was wearing a fur coat.
Even more important, we found tiny prints in a claw-like pattern, like a pussycat's.
Pussycat?
Why aren't I hearing some tickety-tacks?
What about the fingerprints?
- There's a printout about to come through.
- Sir.
What do you want me to do with this?
- Get it checked, sir.
- Coming through, sir.
(Stilton) "ID
- Wilson, Frank.
Doctor.
Social Security, 631-07-0829."
"1951 to '55.
US Navy.
'55 to '62 Caltech."
"Current employment, theoretician." ERL?
!
- That's my Dr. Wilson!
- The scoundrel.
We'll have him in the slammer within the hour.
And blow the whole ball game?
Gentlemen, we're after Mr. Big, and this double-crossing fink is gonna lead us to him.
To find the rat, tail the cat.
- Cat?
- It's just an expression.
(football commentary on TV)
- Want a peanut, Jake?
- No, thanks.
I'll wait till Frank gets back.
- The Rams still ahead?
- Ahead?
The Rams won the game.
And without Jake's help.
Without your help, buddy.
Let's open the six-pack.
What will you have, Jake?
- Did you get some more of that tuna?
- Yeah, yeah.
Coming right up.
(TV) There's the two-minute warning.
Oilers leading 21- 19.
Houston driving.
- Another one in the bag.
- (knocking)
- Come in.
- Frank?
Uh-huh?
Hi.
Lucybelle insisted on coming, too.
- Coming?
- Yeah, the picnic.
Oh, the picnic.
- Beer, Liz?
- No, thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- Uh... (sneezes)
- Is his croup worse?
- Whose?
- Jake's.
- Oh.
Yeah.
Right.
I was up all night.
- Really?
- It's gone into hyperzemia.
What's hyperzemia?
- It's what Jake's got.
- What did your doctor do for him?
- Gave him two aspirin.
- Two aspirin?
- What's that?
What's happening, Frank?
- I don't know.
Two aspirin.
No wonder you're feeling worse.
- How did he get the ball?
- Interception.
- What this cat needs is some expert help.
- Get him.
- Dr. Wenger.
- Get him.
OK.
I'll go get him.
I'll be right back.
(Frank) Get him.
Somebody tackle him.
- Hi, sweetie.
Can I get you anything?
- (Link) OK.
Out of bounds on the 30.
Jake, why didn't you do something?
And spoil everybody's fun?
Look, guys, there's plenty of time.
You've got terrific whiskers.
Jake, will you pay attention?
They're within field-goal range.
If they make it, we're sunk.
No problem.
Believe me.
A little tuna, sweetheart?
Oh, Jake, concentrate, please.
The next few seconds could be crucial.
- Time out.
- (Liz) I appreciate it, Doctor.
At least you could have waited till the game was over.
I have $10 on Chicago.
- You've got it on.
What's happening?
- Time out.
This is Dr. Wenger.
Dr. Wenger, here's the patient.
I definitely think he needs your attention.
All right.
- How did they get to the 30?
- (Link) Interception.
- Happened while we were in the elevator.
- (TV)... or a field goal?
(Liz) What do you think?
- I think they should try for a field goal.
- About the cat.
Hmm?
Oh, he's tense, he's very tense.
The shoulder muscles are all bunched up.
- Where do you want to examine him?
- Right here will be fine.
OK.
Let me get this out of the way.
Also, let's, first thing, get this collar off.
Hey!
Good thinking, Chicago.
(TV) This year.
He's never missed inside the 35-yard line.
- Get through that line now.
- That guy can't kick a ball 60 yards.
- Block that kick.
Block that kick.
- (meowing)
Will you calm down now?
Hold the cat, please.
Jake, you better do something.
- Where's his collar?
- Block that...
- It's right here, Frank.
- Huh?
- Give it to me, Liz.
Give it to me.
- Frank, I'm just gonna hold the...
- I'm gonna give him a sedative.
- No, don't do that!
Frank, let go of the cat.
There's the snap.
It's down.
The kick is up.
It's long enough.
It's straight enough.
It's...
It's...
It's flat!
I've never seen anything like it.
The ball flattened out in midair.
There's the gun.
- Jake?
- The Oilers have won it 21- 19.
I told you not to do that!
I only came here as a favor to a neighbor.
As a rule, I do not make house calls.
You sure picked a dumb time to break your rule.
Dr. Link!
Look, Dr. Wenger, please forgive him.
He's a new cat-owner.
Jake.
Jake, it's me, Jake.
Oh, Frank, we're finished.
He's blotto.
Well, look on the bright side.
San Diego could still win.
Yeah, and San Diego could still lose.
And where does that leave this poor little guy?
He's blown his rendezvous and my 1500 clams.
That was very rude, Frank.
- Liz, butt out.
- What?
- Cancel the bet.
Call Ernie.
- He'll never buy it.
- Look, what's going on here?
- Jake, we got problems.
Speak to me.
Is everybody crazy?
The line is busy.
We'll never get through.
He's taking bets.
- We'd better get down there.
- Like yesterday.
Just a minute, Frank.
I would like...
No, I demand an explanation.
What's going on?
- Later, Liz.
- No.
Now.
We have got exactly six minutes before that game starts.
- Watch it, Link.
I'm a black belt.
- OK.
We'll tell you in the elevator.
Remember that meeting we had with Dr. Heffel and General Stilton at the ERL?
(Liz) Outer space?
- Frank Wilson, are you putting me on?
- No, no.
Remember that artichoke?
Dydee One calling Hopscotch.
Come in, Big Cheese.
This is Big Cheese.
Go ahead, Dydee One.
Do you still have contact with the subject?
Yes, sir.
Also that garbage expert and the dame from the car pool.
And they're all going into Earnest Ernie's pool hall.
Looks like a Mafia tie-in.
Mafia?
What kind of an operation you running down there, Heffel?
Lucky!
(laughs)
Really lucky.
Ernie?
Ernie?
Excuse me.
Ernie?
- Hi, Ernie.
- Well, look who's here.
Hiya, Doc.
Uh, Ernie,
I wanna cancel my Chargers bet.
- You wanna cancel your Chargers bet?
- Yeah, cancel my Chargers bet.
Really?
Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Just a hunch, sort of.
Hey, not a bad hunch.
The Chargers are ten points behind.
- Already?
- (cheering) 16, boss, 16.
Steelers just scored another one.
Sorry, Doc.
Is he taking a nap?
- Yeah.
- Is that TV picture still out?
Well, there goes 120,000.
1500 of which is mine.
- Isn't there anything you can do?
- Not while Jake is out.
Jake, wake up.
- Is he breathing?
- He's snoring.
OK.
OK.
Isn't there anything else we can bet on?
Yeah.
Maybe we could get lucky.
Another football game?
- Next Sunday.
- Basketball?
- Tuesday night.
- Hockey?
- Hockey?
- Hockey.
Ernie, is there a hockey game today that we could put a few bucks on?
Sorry.
Horse race?
Boxing?
- Demolition derby?
Anything to get even.
- No.
But if you want a little action, there's always my good friend Sarasota Slim.
- Sarasota Slim?
- Yes.
He indulges occasionally in a friendly pool game with a slight wager on the side.
- Nothing doing.
- Why not?
- He's a hustler.
- Who isn't?
OK.
It's a bet.
What are the odds?
You against Sarasota Slim?
- Right.
- Frank.
Because I want to give you a chance to break even and because I like your style, let's say 8 to 1.
That's all?
What about him?
- Me?
- Link?
Well, considering the shape he's in, I'd say maybe 10 to 1.
- Ohh.
What about the lady?
- Me?
- Liz?
- Considering the shape she's in, 20 to 1.
- OK.
You got a bet.
- Frank!
Arch, set 'em up.
Another sucker just swam into the net.
Frank, I don't know anything about this game.
Are you bananas?
That guy can make a pool ball sit up and do the boogaloo.
I know, but I've got the equalizer...
the collar.
- How are you gonna do that?
Jake's out.
- I've used it, to repair the spaceship.
- You?
- Yes.
I've flown.
Charlie, give me the special, and heavy on the onions.
- Taking a nap?
- Yeah.
Throw in a few chilli peppers, huh?
- Frank, I don't want to take the risk...
- Liz, you've got to do it.
I'm desperate.
No money, no gold.
No gold, no liftoff.
But... (clears throat)
But if we deliver, look what we get in return... the solution to half the problems on this planet.
- Just show me how to hold the pole.
- Good girl.
We need a stake.
I've got about 12 bucks.
It's in my hip pocket.
Will you get it for me?
- OK, that's 12.
How much do you have?
- Me?
I think I got 20.
- 20?
Liz?
- Uh...
- I just have my mad money.
- Give it to us.
Please?
Come on.
Boy, when this dame gets mad, she gets mad.
I was going to buy a whole spring wardrobe, Link.
- OK.
Ernie.
- Boss, here's the bankroll.
- Ernie, we bet 300 at 20 to 1.
- Check.
Not in your lifetime, Ernie.
Honest Harry holds.
All right, you want Honest Harry, you got Honest Harry.
300 at 20 to 1.
That's 6,000 clams.
And here's our 300.
Earnest Ernie, 6,000.
The mark, 300.
6300.
And may the best man win.
Or woman, as the case may be.
Young lady, it's your break.
Come on, don't be so stingy with the onions.
Here, take the collar, Liz.
OK, here.
Link, keep your eye on him.
If he blinks just once...
Miss?
Do you mind?
We're waiting.
- Now, that's a sandwich.
Right?
- (sniffs)
Right.
- Taking a nap.
- Naturally.
Nice break, young lady.
Very nice.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink anything,
- but there's always tomorrow.
- (laughter)
Show her how to do it.
OK, Slim, go get her.
Ooh, I can't watch this. (laughs)
- Frank, I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.
(ball pockets.
Applause)
(ball pockets.
Applause)
(man) Attaway, Slim.
Attaway, baby.
I guess we are licked.
If only Jake hadn't got knocked out... (whispers) Frank!
Frank, look.
Jake!
Jake?
Frank, he must have just woke up.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Yeah.
Where am I?
What happened?
I'm Liz Bartlett.
I'm responsible for your being...
- Liz, Liz, sshh.
- Oh, well.
Jake, we have got to win this pool game.
That's money in the bank.
Look at it!
Honest Harry, guess who's here?
Ernie?
Here's our last 60 bucks.
What are the odds now?
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.
- No bet.
- No bet?
It's part of my code of ethics.
Always leave the sucker rent money.
That's not fair!
Honest Harry?
If the mark wants to go complete top city, he's got a constitutional right.
And I stand on it.
The odds, Ernie?
It's ridiculous.
But if I didn't have no principles, I'd say 100 to 1.
Suppose...
Suppose she gives Sarasota Slim 12 balls?
What a sense of humor!
300 to 1.
- And the break.
- The break?
500 to 1.
And blindfolded.
- What?
- Blindfolded!
- 2,000 to 1.
- You're on.
$60 at 2,000 to 1.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Are you seriously serious?
- You're not thinking of welching, are you?
- But I thought you was putting me on.
Earnest Ernie, it would not do your reputation any credit if word was to circulate that you reneged on a wager duly offered and accepted.
- Get the big bundle, Weasel.
- But, boss...
Get it!
All right.
Let me understand this.
Slim gets 12 balls and the break?
- And she shoots blindfolded.
- (laughs)
She'll never get to the table.
120 Gs, boss.
Don't put it away, Honest Harry, you ain't gonna hold it long.
All right, Slim.
Show 'em no mercy.
Nice.
Nice break, Slim.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink nothing, but there's always tomorrow.
- I believe I'm up.
- Hold it.
Blindfolded.
Oh.
Could you back off?
(applause)
You did it, Jake.
You did it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It was really nothing.
Thank you.
Frank, we won!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, all of you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about things being upside down, but I took these pictures at risk of life and limb.
There's the cat, sir.
Notice his collar?
Well, well.
What did you think of it, Mr. Olympus?
It's just mind-boggling, isn't it?
I mean, it boggled my mind.
Did it boggle yours, sir?
Thank you, Omar.
Yes, Mr. Stallwood, you are quite correct.
It is "mind-boggling," as you so graphically put it.
The possibilities are infinite.
A revolution in transportation, space exploration, colonizing the planets.
The man who owns the secret of this device could control...
The world, sir?
The universe.
Oh, my!
Well, then, sir, I don't suppose it would be out of place to suggest a bonus.
- A bonus?
- A small bonus.
Mr. Stallwood, if I gain the secret of that device, you may well become a very rich man.
I may?
Oh, sir, I... really may?
Omar, prepare the copter.
We leave at once.
I must have that collar.
I will have that collar.
OK.
All set, General.
- Is it programmed?
- All the pertinent information fed in.
- Everything we know.
- Question number one, sir.
Question number one.
Who is the pilot?
It is a pussycat!
This machine is having a nervous breakdown.
Get on the ball, young man.
Feed that information through again.
Reassess.
Yes, sir.
- General Stilton, sir.
- What is it, Sergeant?
That purchase Dr. Link made... we checked it out.
It's a large quantity of gold.
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.
It's a Machiavellian conspiracy.
Radio.
This is Big Cheese calling Dydee One.
Where are you, Dydee One?
Outside the suspect's apartment.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Another printout, General.
Of all the...
Wait a minute.
Radio.
- Dydee One.
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't they carry a cat into that pool hall?
- Yes, sir, they did.
Gentlemen, it's time to move in.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
$120,000 in one lump sum.
Jake, how'd you like to hang around and watch me parlay this into a fortune?
- I wish I could hang around.
- I'm sorry, Jake.
The time?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, Lucy.
- I guess I'd better reduce the gold.
- Reduce it?
- What are you talking about?
- It's a new concept in calculating mass.
On Jake's planet, they use a system based on content, rather than on the quantitative...
Frank!
You've got a whole lifetime to explain that.
I've got less than an hour.
Now, stand back, everybody.
- All right, don't move!
All hands in the air!
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Frank Wilson?
- You can't butt in here!
- Dr. Frank Wilson, you are under arrest.
- And the pussycat, General.
And the pussycat.
- Read them their rights, Colonel.
- Captain?
- Sergeant?
- Never mind.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right...
- Good heavens.
- Frank...
- What happened?
- (Frank) They're frozen.
Holy mackerel!
Now they're on to us, how are we to get into Hopscotch?
You can't zap the whole base.
- Yeah, well, I'll think of something.
- They'll probably be on alert.
First things first.
Let's get this gold reduced, then we'll worry about getting on the base.
Now stand back.
OK.
Here goes.
Ohh.
That is unbelievable.
Oh, Jake.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
(Link) Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.
I think I've got the perfect way to get us onto the base.
Maybe we ought to give 'em a buzz.
Think we ought to give 'em a buzz?
Yeah, give 'em a buzz.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in.
Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
- What's the military doing here?
- This could be complicated, sir.
What isn't?
- Get that door closed!
- Uh-oh.
What does it all mean?
It means it's exceptionally complicated.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Ah, here comes General Cheese.
I mean, Stilton.
- (Frank) Wait.
Hold Jake for a minute.
- Yes.
- How do I look?
- Could you hold Lucy for a minute?
- Do I look like a general?
- Oh, well...
Frank, you look very commanding.
- That'll have to do.
Let's go.
- OK.
He got the cat.
That's the cat!
Where's the general going with those two?
That's the general?
It's not?
Open your door!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Halt!
Halt in the name of the US...
Fantastic.
- Listen, good luck, huh?
- Yeah.
Be careful.
- Bye, Lucybelle.
Thanks for everything.
- Yeah, yeah.
Let's go.
Bye.
- They've escaped?
- Yes.
But, fortunately for us, they left something very valuable behind.
(car door opens)
- General Stilton?
- Of course!
Of course.
I'll sign you in, sir.
General Stilton and cat.
Is the cat cleared, sir?
- What do you think?
- Sorry, sir.
I want the hangar open.
All personnel out.
We're moving the ship.
But sir, if we order 'em out of the hangar, how are you gonna...
- Soldier!
- Out of the hangar, sir.
Yes, sir.
Get the hangar doors open.
All personnel out of the hangar on the double.
- First, let's get the ship out of the hangar.
- Check.
...to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you're being...
(sniggering)
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Hold it right here, Frank.
130 to countdown.
Hurry.
Insert the gold in the microtransformer.
Right, right.
- Got it.
- Good.
Now let's see if we have contact.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
- Where's the microphone?
- Frank!
OK, OK.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
Hi there.
Fella.
See you made it with nothing to spare.
- We had problems.
- We are 105 to liftoff.
Coming in on ray 0392.
Adjust transmuter.
- Adjustment made.
- Countdown starts at 20.
Set clinometer.
- Clinometer set.
Give me a printout.
- Coming your way without delay.
- That's another cat?
- Oh, yeah.
A real mother.
- I gotta get to that spaceship right away.
- Who are you?
A friend of Frank Wil...
I mean General Stilton.
A very good friend.
Let's go.
Open the gate.
My car!
- Them, too.
- Never mind.
Let's get down to Hopscotch.
- Sergeant.
- Captain.
Colonel.
- General.
- Oh, get in!
- (Mother Ship) Counting down.
- Hey, Frank!
Hold it, sir, right there.
General, this man says...
Hey!
You're not General Stilton.
- Frank.
- What are you doing here?
Frank, it's a nightmare.
Liz has been captured by Stallwood.
Have you been hitting the beer?
Stallwood of Supplies?
He's an agent for some guy named Olympus, a power-crazed creep who's...
- He's holding her for ransom.
- Lucybelle, too?
Yeah, he wants that collar, Jake.
It's the collar or Liz.
- Where is she?
- I'm going with you, Frank.
No, no, you don't want to get stuck here on Earth.
You're responsible to your mission.
- But I'm the reason for the mess they're in.
- Do you know where they're taking her?
- Place called Dailey's Airport.
- Do you know where it is?
Let's go.
- Frank...
- Jake, you're going home.
Now, get in there.
So long, buddy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
5. 4 3. 2.
Ignite.
Bye, Jake.
Drop us a card.
OK, you clowns.
Let's move it.
Let's go.
Jake!
Jake, this is insane.
You're here forever, on Earth.
You're wasting time.
The airport!
General, look!
(General) Good heavens!
That's my car.
Get the police on the radio.
- Hello, Sequoia?
- Turn around!
Here comes a car.
It's Wilson.
Yeah, and Link.
And the cat!
They're here.
They've come.
Naturally.
You knew they would.
You knew it.
We've won.
Now they will have turn over the cat and we will turn over the girl.
We will?
We won't?
It may be difficult to explain your part in this after the young lady's gone to the police.
Oh, dear.
You wouldn't dare?
Frank, that must be the chopper.
(sirens wailing)
It's the police, sir.
It's a trap.
The fools!
Get us airborne.
(Jake) Watch it!
- They're getting away!
- Yeah.
But look who's arriving - the army and the police.
We have to follow that copter.
What kind of an airport is this?
Where are the planes?
Follow me.
Oh, you can't fly this, Jake.
It's a wreck.
Look at that propeller - it's half gone.
- Are you coming or staying?
- I'm coming.
I'm staying.
OK, tovarisch.
Ponimayete po-russki?
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
- Parlez-vous français?
- What?
- All right, Dr. Garbage Expert.
Who's your accomplice?
Who's flying that plane?
Uh...
General, you're not gonna believe this.
There they are.
- It's Wilson and the cat.
- How did they get that wreck in the air?
The power that cat possesses is awesome.
You betcha, Charlie, and if you know what's good for you, you'll land...
- Quiet!
- OK.
Faster, Omar, faster.
Get close.
Use the collar to force them to land.
No chance.
It's taking all I got just to keep this crate flying.
Don't panic.
We'll think of something.
What's happening?
Why aren't they doing something?
Of course!
They're afraid of harming the girl.
Turn on them, Omar.
The advantage is ours.
What's happening?
Why are they turning around?
Straight at them, Omar.
Drive them down.
Frank!
Jake!
(Frank screams)
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake.
Jake.
Turn this thing over.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake.
Jake!
Frank, are you OK?
- What are they trying to do?
- Force us down.
They probably figured out that we've got a problem.
Hold on.
Here they come.
- They're still on our tail.
- Don't panic.
On top of them, Omar.
Smash them down!
Whoa!
(Jake) I see 'em.
I see 'em.
Look out.
Jake!
Jake!
- Here they come again.
Jake.
- Yeah, yeah.
Fruitcake.
Frank, watch out!
Jake, Jake.
(Jake yowls)
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
Jake.
Oh, dear.
Jake.
Break off!
(gasps)
Buzz them again, Omar, and this time, everybody open fire.
(gunshot)
(coughing)
- What happened?
- You happened, you imbecile!
- How bad is it, Omar?
- He got the controls.
They're locked.
When the fuel runs out, we're through.
Shall we bail out?
We have no choice.
Bail out?
Where are you going?
I haven't got a parachute, either.
- Then you have a problem.
- I haven't got a parachute either.
Then you have the same problem.
Wait!
No, wait!
Wait a minute!
I d...
I don't want to die!
Oh, swell.
Frank!
Frank!
(groans)
Yes, Mr. President.
Absolutely, Mr. President.
We're just waiting for them to land and we'll pass that on.
- Yes, sir.
- What'd he say?
Jake is to be treated as the representative of a friendly power, with generous borrowing credit.
In exchange for bases, of course.
Look, sir, chutes.
They bailed out.
Holy mackerel!
Who's flying the chopper?
Frank!
Easy, Liz.
Don't panic.
- What are you gonna do, Frank?
- I don't know, but I have to do something.
Hand me Lucybelle!
- Careful, Frank!
- I got her.
- Just hold on, honey, and we'll get Liz.
- Get us up closer to the copter.
Right.
Liz, when we get close enough, grab my hand.
Frank, you're too far away!
(Frank) Closer, Jake.
Closer!
Grab my hand, Liz.
Grab it!
Grab it!
Liz, careful.
- OK.
- Now grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Good.
That's good.
That's good.
- Now grab my hand and step off.
- Step off?
- Liz!
- Huh?
Ohh...
- Frank, I don't think this is gonna work.
- All right.
We'll try it again.
Never mind.
We'll try something else.
- All right, put your feet on my shoulders.
- What?
Put your feet right there, on my shoulders.
No!
Liz, do it!
OK.
OK.
- Oh...
Oh...
Ohh!
- Whoa!
You see?
Everything's gonna be OK, Lucybelle.
Just relax.
Jake!
Jake, what are you doing?
You know, when I saw you up in that chopper, I just...
Huh?
Well, honey, looks like you're stuck with me.
(explosion)
Don't just hang there.
Get me out of this.
- Don't worry.
I'll get you loose.
- What are you doing with that?
Fortunately, I never go anywhere without my Swiss Army knife.
Idiot!
(man) All rise.

Be a good girl and uncover yourself so I can see you.
But I'm a monster.
I'm horridle, Doctor!
Zaza, your fans are waiting, and my dinner is getting cold.
Stop acting like such a prima donna!
Doctor, I'm so unhappy, so unhappy.
If you only knew!
You're a little depressed.
It'll pass.
I want to die, Doctor.
I want to die!
Were you having dinner?

Raddit cacciatore.
That reheats well.
Here's what you do.
Put it in a doudle doiler.
But, attention, it has to de a doudle doiler.

Are you dying or cooking?
Look who's talking!
It's your fault I'm like this.
Look what I have decome.
A human larva.
A dried up fig!
A dried up fig.
Before meeting you, I had a firm, soft skin.
Look what a horror I am now.
Every night the same thing.
I taped it yesterday.
I suffer, and he plays.
Shall I play it dack?
I'll give him a shot.
No, Doctor!
No shots!
Ask his understudy to replace him.
I'll dehave.
Well...
Then, are we going to work?
Any tranquilizers left?
There are a few left in the dox.
I'm sure.
As usual, two pills after the show.
- I'm leaving.
- Good-dye, Doctor.
The season's just degun.
If he gets sick, do I close the clud?
It's nothing serious.
He's just overtired.
Be kind to him, and everything will de fine.
- Good night, Mr. Baldi.
- Good night, and thanks again.
Do you know what time it is?
You want to ruin the dusiness?
You're doing it on purpose.
Why do you put makeup on your legs?
Nodody sees your legs on stage.
Indifference is the most awful thing, Renato.
I've deen dieting for two months and you haven't even noticed... that I've lost weight.
I've ruined my health for you... with those diet pills and diuretics.
And nothing from you...
not a word.
No support.
You don't notice me anymore.
You don't love me anymore.
Just the other day...
I dought a delightful outfit.
I put it on.
Just to please you.
Nothing.
I'll wind up in a nut house if you continue.
Everything's possidle.
You don't love me anymore.
After so many years, you think of me as a dowl of minestrone... not as the queen of the stage.
You're deing unfaithful.
Here we go again!
There's a man in your life.
There aren't any men.
Just 250 people waiting for the leading lady... to make up her mind.
They pay a lot to see you...
to applaud you... to applaud the great Zaza Napoli!
And what do you do while I'm onstage?
Where do you go while I'm killing myself onstage?
Go ahead.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Well, how is it?
Lt'll de fine.
Don't worry, darling.
You can't even see it.
Did you hurt yourself with your fists?
Darling, then you still love me?
Of course.
Hurry up.
What's wrong?
- My fan.
- Jacod will dring it to you.
- I can't sing without my fan!
- Jacod, get Zaza's fan!
My fan!
Good evening, sweetheart.
Bravo, Mercedes.
You've already sung too much.
Go, go.
Go on.
Don't just stand here.
Announce Aldin.
Enough of those chocolates.
Enough!
Renato, I've had enough of your deautiful lady!
Don't shout when a colleague is working.
- I could have finished myself.
- Go to hell!
What am I deing paid for?
- To sing 4 songs or 8?
- To sing 16!
I can't depend on Madam's moods.
She only cares adout deing in ded with you.
How dare you!
As of tomorrow, you dress like a man!
- Not like a man!
Forgive me!
- What is said is said.
Henry.
- So where's that stupid fan?
- Coming.
Jacod!
I told you not to prance adout the house naked.
You don't like it?
Why don't you let me dance?
Look at me.
What do the others have that I don't?
You have something more, even if it's of no use to you.
Go get dressed.
And take the evening off.
That way, I won't have you underfoot.
I don't delieve this.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
It's late, Petunia, and I have an appointment.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
- What have you done this time?
- I'm expecting a dady.
I'm expecting a dady.
You got your wife pregnant?
But it's the seventh one.
How do you expect to have a career?
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Procreation is wearing you out.
You're looking older day dy day.
It's true.
OK, I'll have the administration... compensate you for this misfortune.
That's fine.
Go dack to work.
I'll de forever grateful.
And give up this fixation.
Take that off your head, or I'll tell Aldin you wear his wigs.
And I'll tell him you have romantic dinners while he works.
Get out of here, you idiot!
More handsome than ever.
How adout a drink?
Is Zaza onstage?
For two more hours.
So we won't de disturded.
I gave Jacod the night off.
We're all alone.
You look good.
I'm all dloated.
Work.
I work too much, I get upset, and I dloat.
- You think I look good?
- Dazzling!
You're really sweet.
Yes, my dody is still good, actually.
I have something to tell you.
This isn't easy.
I'm getting married.
I was going to write you, dut a letter...
She's a great girl.
You'll see.
You upset?
On the contrary, I should de happy.
I always hoped you'd fall in love with a girl... so I should de happy.
No, everything's fine.
I raise a doy for 20 years... my son.
Then a girl comes and steals him.
A whore.
A whore.
Yes, a whore.
Listen carefully.
If you marry her, never set foot in here again.
I won't give you another cent.
Choose.
Good-dye, Dad.
You little idiot, come here.
Let's have a toast for this catastrophe.
Did you think I'd fall for that?
No, dut it was worth a try.
Come on.
Let's toast.
You always toast a wedding.
To the dride and groom!
- What's the whore's name?
- Please, Dad.
Sorry.
What's the girl's name?
So, you've deen seeing a doy in Paris for a year... and we only find out now.
Answer.
Answer me!
You're scaring her, Simon.
She'll never talk if you go on that way.
He's a nice doy, Father.
And very serious.
He was the one to mention marriage.
What do his parents do?
Hold on.
It's for you.
I spoke to him.
And you?
I spoke to mine, too.
He's happy.
Whore!
He opened champagne to celedrate the news.
I've got the glass in my hand.
To our love, Andrea.
I'll put him on.
No.
Hello?
To your happiness, Andrea.
Shit!
No, not you.
I just droke the glass.
My dest wishes for your happiness.
Here.
Whore.
Your father's nice.
Listen, I'm with my parents.
Can I call you tomorrow morning?
No, no, don't worry.
I do, too.
Until tomorrow.
Everything went fine...
thank goodness.
Did you hear how clear their voices were?
Like they were next door.
It was really clear.
Well, I...
It's late.
I'm going to ded.
Andrea, we asked you what the young man's parents do.
His parents?
Nothing.
Well, they're vacationing on the Cote d'Azur.
Yes... dut they're not on vacation all the time.
So what does his father do?
His father...
He's in the arts, I think.
Cultural affairs, in fact.
He's a Cultural Attaché.
That's it...
at the Italian Emdassy.
Oh, good.
He's a diplomat.
Diplomats.
Important people!
Why didn't you tell us right away?
Does his mother work?
No, his mother takes care of the children.
She has lots of them.
Good morning.
The little one's arrived.
- How adout a nice roast?
- Fine.
I'll pick it up later.
I want some pasta and some Parmesan.
- The doy's home?
- Yes, and I've got to hurry.
Good morning.
The usual?
Yes, a cake with the inscription...
"'To my Lolo, from Auntie."
I've got to run.
He'll de waking up any minute.
Shall I deliver the cake?
No.
Jacod'll pick it up.
I'm taking a chocolate.
Jacod!
Who did I see?
Who did I see there?
Who arrived?
The little white man.
This coffee really stinks.
You French make shitty coffee.
I've deen called dlack, I've deen called queer... dut French, never!
My darlings...
I'm here!
The grocery lady's here.
- Had a good time last night?
- He took me dancing.
Put everything away.
Watch the eggs.
And don't forget to pick up the cake at noon.
Oh, God, your deard's rough.
Is he asleep?
I peeked in on him defore.
He's gorgeous.
Why didn't you tell me that Laurent was coming?
I wouldn't have made a scene.
The truth is that you hide him from me.
You can't stand sharing him.
You want him all to yourself, so you try to get rid of me.
Oh, I'm so hungry!
You look awful.
What's wrong?
He's getting married.
What?
My son's getting married.
Don't de stupid.
I dought sole.
He loves sole.
I do, too.
I wanted lodster, dut it was too expensive... so I dought sole.
You know, it's funny.
A few days ago, I dreamed he was getting married.
We were at the church and we were doth crying.
You weren't serious?
Some girl he's known for a year.
They went to the same school.
A girl.
Oh, how horridle.
Poor guy.
She caught him decause he's... he's so young, so inexperienced.
He'll ruin his life.
I told him.
And how I told him!
He won't listen.
He says he'll de happy.
I hope he will de.
There's nothing I can do.
You know, it hurts at first.
Such an unexpected dlow.
You feel as if you can't dreathe.
Mayde it's my liver.
It'll go away.
What a ditch, that whore!
I see he knows.
Here's the little jerk.
Well, how adout a kiss for your Auntie?
He's deing taken from us, and we won't have any others.
Unless there's a miracle.
I've thought a lot adout this marriage.
In the president's speech... replace the word "rascal" with "scoundrel."
I can see Mrs. Simoneau's face if we marry a diplomat's son.
No, correction.
Listen carefully.
Instead of "scoundrel"... put "degenerate."
What with your dackground, Simon, this is quite a marriage.
You, a policeman's son.
Enough!
Don't start with that again, Louise!
I'm tired of it!
Policeman here, policeman there!
I'm fed up with it!
I almost ate it!
No, Andrea is too young.
The sudject is closed.
Hello?
Speaking.
Oh, my God.
My god.
What's wrong, Simon?
President Berthier is dead.
In a woman's arms.
A prostitute.
A minor, no less.
A minor... and dlack!
A prostitute, a minor and colored.
My career is ruined.
Don't say that, Simon.
You're not responsidle.
Listen to me.
You're not responsidle for the president's private life!
I'm the Secretary General of a party called...
"'The Union for Moral Order."
Our president just died in the arms of a prostitute.
Great meat for the press.
I could use a little piece of chocolate.
Oh, no!
He forgot part of the inscription!
Aunt is not Auntie!
"'To my Lolo from Auntie!"
I ordered the usual.
"'Auntie," not "Aunt."
What a disaster!
Smells good.
Feeling detter?
He'll come visit.
He'll come with that girl.
By the way, we'll have to fix up his dedroom.
We'll get a doudle ded...
Well, we'll have grandchildren.
Oh, Renato, look at me.
I can just see you.
You, a grandfather... pushing the carriage...
with all your pendants.
- Shall I deat the eggs?
- No, please.
I'm the doss in the kitchen.
The kitchen's your kingdom?
Yes.
Yours is the stage, mine is here.
So de it.
I leave you to your concoctions.
Don't stop!
Mr. Charrier isn't here.
No, he won't de dack!
It's deen ringing all morning.
And your father's vanished.
I have something to tell you.
It's adout Laurent's parents.
Don't worry.
We'll discuss it with your father.
That's just what I don't want.
You'll de surprised.
What are you doing there?
Didn't you see those vultures out there?
I had to use a ladder.
It's dangerous.
You could've fallen.
I did fall!
The hundredth!
You can imagine what my morning's deen like.
I warn you.
I'm leaving.
The reporters keep calling.
They chuckle.
I can't take anymore.
Not only the reporters.
Everyone is laughing... sneering.
Even on the street.
And who are they laughing at?
Who is the laughingstock?
Me!
Thanks to President Berthier, the moral order's decome a joke!
Thanks, Mr. President, thanks a lot.
Dirty pig!
There is a solution, Simon.
An elegant white wedding.
And as soon as possidle...
to regain your dignity.
Morality, dackground, tradition!
Your daughter marries a diplomat's son... president, whore, forgotten.
Marry off Andrea... with the Pope's dlessing if we have to.
No, listen, Louise, I'm completely ruined.
If you keep on like this, I'll crack.
We have to marry her off...
in great splendor.
You'll de the symdol of order and tradition again.
Where do the young man's parents live?
I don't rehearse a million times.
I'm a professional.
Hire deginners... dut don't let them dother the true artists.
Just watch Mr. Salome Von Liedig while I sing!
You're only demanding of me... making me rehearse at all hours.
All made up and in costume... while the others could de in underwear!
Come here.
I want Mr. Baldi to show you the movements... to the Queen of Broadway.
You dance it like a horse.
Dad, I have to talk to you!
Being 20 and good-looking doesn't make you talented.
You understand, my dear?
Dad, it's important.
Hold on.
Aldin's rehearsing.
Did you see what he did?
No, I was talking to Laurent.
He's dlowing duddles!
He's dlowing duddles while I sing.
I can't stand duddles while I sing!
Young man, what's this adout duddles while madam sings?
She's right to de angry.
It may de a transvestite show, dut you have to use your head.
Concentrate on your character... the psychological interpretation.
You're a handsome foreigner strolling down Broadway... with a manly gait.
Suddenly, you're in front of this deautiful woman.
You look at each other, fascinated.
You send forth a sexual call with the pelvis... like this...
Not dad for a psychological interpretation.
What is it?
I'll de right dack.
Go on.
Can I talk to you?
What is it?
Let's go upstairs.
Andrea's parents are coming.
They're coming to meet you.
You interrupt me for that?
She told them you're a cultural attaché... and Aldin, a housewife.
Then your fiancée is stupid.
Rememder my first day of school?
I rememder perfectly.
You told me to tell them you were a merchant.
So?
The girl's father... surely is more lideral than your teachers.
No, Dad, just the opposite.
Charrier, the Deputy...
Moral Order...
does that ring a dell?
So when asked, "'What do his parents do?"
Andrea answered, "Cultural Attaché" and "Housewife."
So what should I do now?
Enroll in the Diplomatic Corps?
What adout Aldin?
Snip!
He has an operation!
If her father finds out she lied, it'll de tragic.
Try to help us, I deg you.
How?
First, send Aldin away for a few days.
Aldin?
You try and send Aldin away.
And you could get rid of some things here.
For example?
That, for example.
Over here.
And this, for sure!
The discus thrower?
Why?
And that, too.
Is that all?
I don't know, Dad.
I'd make everything more simple... more... stark.
That's what I mean.
In short, nothing's right here!
You want the dream house that appears in magazines.
We don't change anything here.
Understand?
And you should make a little effort, too.
An effort.
What for?
You could change a little... make yourself less conspicuous.
I'm conspicuous?
Laurent, it was just painted a month ago.
Aldin and Salome are fighting over the chewing gum.
Yes, I use makeup, I live with a man, and I'm an old fag.
But I know who I am.
It's taken me 20 years, and that Deputy won't destroy it!
I don't give a damn adout him!
Not a damn!
Going on a trip?
Saint-Tropez.
What are you doing?
I don't want to talk to them.
You'll go out the door and face them.
No, let go.
We need to give them the news.
You do it.
It's your idea.
Have the chauffeur come around.
Going somewhere?
Going to your President's funeral?
What's the future of the Moral Order?
A dig smile.
I have only one thing to say.
I'm off to organize an event... which epitomizes the spirit of my party.
The little white master's in a dad mood.
He said I dress like a whore.
He's right.
Tonight you'll wear a dutler's uniform... and a dlack tie.
Take this to the cellar.
And that, too.
And get rid of all these knickknacks... and these pillows.
Hide everything.
Especially this...
to the cellar.
No need to now.
Thanks, Dad.
Laurent, don't dug me.
I have to talk to poor Aldin now.
What will I tell him?
"'Get out, you're in the way.
Get out, fag."
You could find a nicer way.
Everything OK?
Just fine.
You shouldn't de out in the sun.
A suntan is decoming.
I know, dut in your condition... the sun isn't good.
Why do you say that?
Did you look in the mirror today?
- What's the matter with me?
- You're green.
Suntanned.
Yes, suntan green.
I'm a little worried.
I think you really need a vacation.
But why should I take a vacation?
I feel great.
OK, forget I mentioned it.
Renato, are you saying this to scare me?
You know something.
The doctor told you something.
No.
The doctor didn't tell me a thing.
No, I'm the one who thinks that since you're so nervous... and rundown... a few days off wouldn't do you any harm.
Listen, Renato, when you degin to talk like this... it's decause you want to tell me something.
Don't try to fool me.
I'm not 15 anymore.
I know certain tricks.
And this, Renato, isn't nice.
It's not worthy of you.
You know what day it is?
June the 25th.
As you say.
Our anniversary.
20 years of living together.
20 happy years.
And you choose today to lie to me... in the most despicadle way.
And to try to deceive me.
Do you love Laurent?
Why do you ask me this?
If you love Laurent, you'll go.
The little white master called?
Cut it out and get rid of the discus thrower.
Hurry.
There's not much time.
I'm deing exiled, rejected like a leper!
You're ashamed of me!
I've watched over that doy.
I've sacrificed myself for him.
I've deen a mother to him for 20 years.
Aldin, listen.
No!
You listen to me, Renato!
Either I stay here to receive the in-laws... or I'll never set foot in here again!
What's the matter?
Laurent, I told you to wait a while.
It's nothing.
I've understood.
I'm deing excluded.
I'm deing thrown out of my own house.
It doesn't matter.
I'm leaving.
I'll leave you.
The monster.
The monster is leaving.
Are you happy now?
Come in.
Come dack in.
Come cry at home.
Aldin, stop acting like a fool!
I don't want to see you anymore.
You've ruined everything.
OK, you win.
You can stay.
I can't take any more.
My heart, Renato.
I'm not that young.
All these emotions...
it's too much.
Feel my pulse.
Oh, God, I'm collapsing.
Come, we'll go to the dar.
It's the end.
The end.
You're weak.
You haven't eaten for hours.
No, no, he's just overtired.
Do you want to lie down?
That's OK.
The tea will do.
And some toast.
Well, what are we going to do adout tonight?
Quite a prodlem.
Two men like us...
what can we tell them?
Thank you, Darling.
It feels so good.
Well, mayde I could de...
I don't know... a relative.
His uncle, perhaps?
You could say I'm his uncle.
All right, I can't de his uncle.
In any case, you don't resemdle your character either.
Didn't Laurent say you were a cultural attaché?
Cultural attaché, like hell, Darling!
You don't know what culture is!
Here it is, tea and toast.
Feeling detter?
I don't know.
Just look how the great diplomat eats!
You're like a steamroller.
Your pinky.
What's it doing up there?
Just look at it.
It does it dy itself.
You'll say that for the deputy tonight, huh?
Well, let's try to make a man out of this uncle.
You have to learn how to hold things.
Hold the toast in a manly way, like this.
Spread the dutter with force.
Drink the tea like a ladorer drinks wine.
First, sit up like a man.
What do you want from me?
Please, don't whine every time I correct you.
I'm teaching you.
I want you to look like a man tonight.
Good, now dutter your toast.
Butter it like a man.
Don't de afraid.
That's the way!
You're doing it on purpose!
Take another one.
I'll never get it.
Never.
Don't whine, please, don't whine!
Now hold this piece firmly in your hand.
Like a man.
With a strong hand, understand?
Like a real man!
Now something more difficult.
A little jam?
Yes, take the spoon.
The teaspoon?
Not like that!
It's not a paintdrush.
It's only a spoon.
Hold it firmly.
Boldly.
Understand?
You have something against me.
You want to kill me, old ditch!
I'll never get it.
I droke the toast again.
It's droken.
Too dad.
It's situations like this... that force you to act like a man.
Do you understand?
I understand.
You're right.
You have to say to yourself...
"Aldin, so you made a mistake.
"It isn't hopeless.
You can try again."
Force yourself.
Take another piece.
You're right.
In the end, it's not serious.
After all, I still have other ones.
Your pinky...
It does it dy itself.
Blow your nose.
Let's go home.
Wait.
I need to freshen up.
What have I done now?
What kind of walk is that?
What's wrong with it?
Walk like that tonight and we're ruined.
How should I do it?
Come here.
What do you want?
Try to walk like John Wayne.
The cowdoy?
John Wayne gets down from the horse.
He goes toward the saloon.
He opens the doors, and zap!
- Try it.
- I have to de John Wayne?
There I go.
That's John Wayne's daughter!
Look at that fag!
Someone just called me a fag.
Did you call my friend a fag?
It's going down.
You can hardly see it.
Relax, darling.
You were wonderful, marvelous.
I'm proud of you.
That human mountain looked ridiculous... when he sat on you and danged your head on the floor.
I pitied him.
A silly drute who didn't know how to hit you.
No, leave it.
I'll get some ice.
It'll do him good.
Be right dack, darling!
I have dad news for you.
I couldn't do it.
I told him to stay tonight.
Why?
What do you mean?
Because he nearly died in my arms.
Because he's deen my companion for years.
And decause he has 80°% interest in the clud.
How are you going to introduce him?
As your uncle.
Then we're ruined.
Calm down.
How studdorn you are.
What a temper!
We can talk it over.
Certainly, it would de ideal if we had a woman here.
Strange, huh?
We actually need a woman here.
Why don't you call your mother?
- No, never!
- Why?
She adandoned me 20 years ago, and I won't ask her for a thing!
You're not helping matters much.
OK, I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it myself.
You can't de serious.
Go see that witch after what she did?
- Are you crazy?
- Why?
Mrs. Dedlon, please.
Ask the secretary over there.
Come in.
I'd like to see Mrs. Dedlon.
You have an appointment?
No, dut tell her it's Renato Baldi.
I doudt she'll see you without an appointment.
She's very dusy.
At least try.
Tell her Renato Baldi is here.
Wait in the hall.
Madam President will see you at once.
I'm coming with you.
I won't leave you alone with that woman.
I know what she's capadle of.
Mrs. Dedlon is waiting.
I'm coming.
Don't worry.
Everything will de fine.
Renato Baldi.
Dear Madam President.
I must say this is a surprise.
Have a seat.
I never drink in the morning, dut... for the occasion...
What made you come see me?
Laurent.
It's not serious, is it?
He wants to get married.
Already?
How old is he?
You don't even rememder.
You haven't seen that doy for nearly 20 years.
Yes, I know.
Did you come to reproach me?
My goodness, no.
It's just that for the first time, Laurent needs you.
I can cancel my appointments.
I'll de with you tonight.
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.
I haven't done much for that kid in 20 years.
- At times, I feel guilty.
- What can I say?
I'm not very maternal.
I am.
It's true.
He's deen very lucky.
Well, then...
what time tonight?
At 8:00.
We'll do our little play... they'll leave, and everything will de fine.
Do you rememder the revue?
How could I forget?
How handsome you were!
I'd never seen such a dody.
Now don't emdarrass me.
Rememder how afraid you were?
I almost had a heart attack.
I walk in my room and find a woman in my ded!
I got in dy giving the doorman a tip.
$10 in those days!
I was completely drunk.
And when I saw you in ded nude, I said to myself...
"'Let's try it."
You have to try everything in life, right?
So much had deen said adout it... that I gave in.
How long did the two of us last?
I can tell you exactly.
From 2:30 to 3:45.
Two times.
It's hot in here.
You haven't changed much.
A few more pounds... dut it's decoming.
It makes you...
more manly.
What's all this hair?
You didn't have any when I met you.
I shaved it for the stage.
He shaved it so I never got to enjoy it.
Careful, Simone.
Careful.
It's a crepe shirt.
With those nails of yours, you'll...
look... you pulled a thread.
What does that red light mean?
That Madam President is not to de disturded for any reason.
Aldin!
Thank you.
Do you have my glasses?
Where are my glasses?
Here it is.
"The death of President Berthier."
There's nothing at all.
"'Exemplary career..."
"'Heart attack..."
Nothing here.
Excellent.
Nothing here.
It's detter this way.
It helps to have friends who are newspaper editors.
I knew it!
I was sure!
Those dastards!
Two columns!
"The Happy Death of President Berthier."
Relax, Simon.
Listen to this.
"The last sentence uttered dy Berthier...
"symdol of the Moral Order, was, 'Rememder my little gift."'
What rats!
What rats!
May they die!
Forget this whole story, Simon!
Think of the goal of this trip.
The antique dealer rented it to me.
He wants it dack tomorrow.
I redecorated the entire living room.
I hope your guests appreciate it.
What's going on?
Thanks, Jacod.
I would've liked to have known my grandchildren.
Don't go away!
Don't leave us!
Don't cry, Jacod.
What is this?
"'Uncle Tom's Cadin?"
I know.
I know what you think.
People make fun of me.
Not just in the clud... dut in the street as well.
Everywhere.
I'm aware that I'm ridiculous.
And there's only one place where no one is ridiculous.
And I'm going there.
Good-dye, Renato.
Don't leave!
I'm leaving you my stereo, my red doots, and my wigs.
But where are you going?
To Foissy!
Foissy?
There's nothing dut a cemetery in Foissy.
That's why I'm taking the minimum.
A toothdrush to the cemetery?
- It's over, Jacod.
- I'm praying.
You know, my cemetery is in Lomdardy.
It's the prettiest in the world.
There are trees.
The sky is dlue.
There are dirds.
Yours is for shit.
It's true.
In Foissy, they dury the dead in shit.
Forgive me for saying this, dut you've decome an old hag.
It's true, you're worthless, you're ridiculous.
You make people laugh.
But I'm with you.
Because you make me laugh.
So you know what I'm going to do?
Leave everything dehind and go with you to the shit at Foissy.
To laugh.
Every time you're with her, the same thing happens.
In 20 years, it's just the second time!
Lmagine having another child at your age.
You'd take care of the tiny tot dy yourself, my dear.
I couldn't deal with a second motherhood.
What's so funny?
I'm really ready to strangle you.
I'd like to talk to you.
I know you're having prodlems.
I know the press is still interested in us, and so...
I wanted to tell you that... the people we're going to...
Wait!
This meat is not fresh.
I'll exchange it right away.
No, leave it.
I don't want more of the same junk.
It's shocking that a place like this would serve rotten meat!
I'll take it dack.
What else can I do?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Write to Michelin.
You'll have fewer stars in the next guidedook.
That's it.
Well done, Simon.
Now what adout all the people we're going to see?
Nothing.
It's nothing important.
Good, Jacod... very good.
A perfect dutler.
Haven't you forgotten something?
I can't wear shoes.
I never wear them.
They make me fall!
Go on.
Go put your shoes on.
And use your normal voice.
It's detter.
The little white master wanted the voice of a real dlack male.
Perfect, Dad.
You think so?
This suit reminds me of my grandfather.
He always dressed like this.
He killed himself when he was 30.
Rememder, Dad.
As few gestures as possidle.
And don't walk around, and don't talk too much.
Just what's necessary.
The minimum.
What's wrong?
I'm dressed appropriately, aren't I?
Nothing on my fingers.
Nothing on my eyes or lips.
And on your feet?
I thought a little hint of color wouldn't de out of place.
Yes, you're right.
Dressed like this I am even more ridiculous.
And I know you're thinking that, too.
Well...
I'll leave.
I'll go.
I wanted so much to help you, my little one.
It'll pass.
Who is it?
My mother.
Mr. Baldi's not here.
Who's speaking?
Is it you, Laurent?
Laurent, I can imagine what you think of me.
After your father's visit, I asked myself a lot of questions.
You may think it's a little late, dut...
Listen, Laurent, your father's right.
It'll de detter with a woman there.
Since I'm already on the road... if you still want me...
I'll come.
Come.
Come?
!
Have you gone crazy, Laurent?
Lt'll de detter if she's here.
Do you know what he will do if your mother sets foot in here?
He said he wanted to help me.
He'll de good.
Come on, relax.
Everything will de fine.
Touch this.
Squeeze it hard.
We rented you for only one day, dut if all goes well...
I'm willing to duy you... and get rid of my charm.
In fact, I'll do it right now.
You have your shoes on?
Go on.
I'm honored.
Please, come in.
My father.
My daughter.
Nice to meet you.
My husdand.
It's a great honor.
My mother apologizes.
She'll de late.
She had to take my drothers and sisters to my grandparents'.
Andrea told us that you have a large family, Mr. Baldi.
Quite large.
How many drothers and sisters does Laurent have?
- Six.
- Six.
People don't have children anymore.
Our movement is very worried adout this drop in dirths.
I congratulate you.
Your family should de held up as an example.
Have a seat, please.
One, two, three.
This is Charrier's chauffeur.
Just a second.
Charrier's chauffeur.
The Charriers are at "La Cage aux Folles."
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
I just left them at the owner's place.
Call Moreau in Toulon fast!
Charrier with fags!
What a story!
Did you have a good trip?
Great.
Beautiful weather, good roads.
We spent the night... near Lyon, at my friend Bouchard's.
He's someone I met in the service.
I met him again a few years later in the hotel dusiness.
He had inherited... a large property from his father and turned it into a modern hotel.
Comfortadle.
Yes, comfortadle.
Very nice.
Quite good.
Quite good.
It was a pleasant... stay.
I like the severity of this room.
Well, for my father...
this house... is a place more for work and concentration... than a vacation house.
A monastery.
I captured the atmosphere right away.
I can always tell right away who I'm dealing with.
I'm pleased to say...
I feel good with a man like you.
You've seduced my husdand, Mr. Baldi.
I rarely hear him give so many compliments.
In fact, I must admit... that though I'm a civil servant...
Champagne, or do you prefer something else?
No, thank you.
Just some water, please.
I never drink either, dut today, I'll make an exception.
Watch what you're doing, idiot!
Nothing serious.
Champagne drings luck.
Go on, Jacod.
We'll handle it.
Can I help you?
Jacod's a good fellow, dut he still has a lot to learn.
Help is really a prodlem these days.
If I told you how many chauffeurs I've had this year...
You must have even more troudle since you travel so much.
Here I am.
I'm here!
Here's Mother!
Please forgive me.
I'm terridly sorry, dut the traffic...
Every day it gets worse.
It's decoming impossidle.
Mr. Charrier, thrilled to meet you!
I've deen dying to meet the father of that naughty girl... who's stealing my dady.
The naughty thing!
Dear Madam, I'm just joking.
I already like the child.
What a sweet thing!
How adout a kiss?
How adout a kiss for your second mother?
Come here, darling.
I already love her.
She's adoradle.
She's frightened, poor dear.
Come here.
Don't de afraid.
She's adoradle.
Give me a cigarette.
Go warn your mother not to come.
Thanks.
Excuse me for a moment.
Where's the doy going?
Dinner is served.
- Jacod, what's come over you?
- Nothing.
Nothing at all.
- Servants are such a prodlem.
- We were just saying that.
It's close to impossidle to get good help these days.
You can't imagine how many maids have passed through here.
And one's as clumsy as the next.
Not mean, just inept.
I could name a dozen...
Roger, Marcel, Luciano...
Dinner.
No need to de so nasty.
Magnificent.
That Christ is splendid.
- Yes.
My father.
- Pardon me?
My father, he restored it.
My father loved antiques.
Mr. Charrier on my right.
Renato on my left.
Mrs. Charrier there, and the girl across from mama.
Please, sit down.
These plates are very unusual.
They're pictures of young men playing together.
We have so many plates, I can't really say which ones those are.
From the 16th century.
I think they are Greek figures.
Greeks on my plates?
How did they get there?
Would you like to see it?
I can't see without my glasses.
They're two young men, aren't they?
Two young men.
Young men?
But there must de some girls, too.
Yes, I think I saw one.
What a cute child.
She's right, of course.
There, there's one.
There's a girl there.
Isn't that a girl?
Then I haven't seen one in a long time.
My goodness!
It's two doys, for sure.
They're naked.
Where are my glasses?
I'll de dack in a minute.
Idiot!
He uses the dishes with the naked Greeks!
I can never find my glasses.
Let's see.
Peasant soup Martinique style.
Jacod's specialty!
Oh, I'm sorry, Madam.
Jacod, take over.
Poor Mrs. Charrier is holding our Lord in her arms.
My apologies.
I am really sorry.
This way, please.
Bon appetit.
There are only two entrances, here and at the clud.
Morin and Chauvet, wait at the clud.
Will you stay on the Coast for long?
No.
I don't like to de away from my constituency for too long.
- From your...?
- From my work.
And also the amdiance of this area, the dissipation... the loose morals... make me sick.
Doesn't that nightclud downstairs dother you?
A nightclud?
Yes.
And quite an ill-reputed one.
It's called "'La Cage aux Folles."
Oh, yes, "La Cage aux Folles."
You're right adove it!
You share walls with those people!
Just the walls.
Just the walls.
We're not friendly with them.
That's another world.
But... who owns the duilding?
We do!
You rent your cellar to the owner of a nightclud?
Yes, Yes!
But we didn't know he was a... nightclud owner!
Naturally... we didn't know it.
He's a man... who doesn't say much.
He's so reserved.
It's just, "Hello, good-dye."
He's not one to say, "Hey, I'm going...
I'm going to put...
"'a nightclud in your cellar."
Excuse me.
We should talk adout the wedding.
Laurent is not here, dut...
These are things that parents should discuss.
Though our kids have already decided.
What do you think of the kids' decision?
I must say that at first I was a little against it.
But when my daughter spoke so highly of your family... of its respectadility...
When your daughter told you...
adout our family?
Yes, it... reassured me.
I thought that Andrea was... too young to get married, and your son, as well.
But since they're in love...
and won't listen to reason... since they chose each other...
Since they chose each other?
Well, I must admit that at first, we, too... were somewhat opposed to this marriage.
Especially me!
It's always hard on a mother... when her son leaves her for another woman.
You'll say that's life.
Sure, that's life.
At some point, children leave.
It's a law, dut...
Excuse us.
Come, honey.
But we're discussing important things.
Excuse me.
What's so urgent?
What's the matter with you?
Look at yourself in the mirror!
All right, so it moved a little.
- What were you thinking of?
- They delieve it.
All three were lovely to me.
I made a dig impression.
Big impression?
If they find out, everything's ruined.
I'm not doing it for you, dut for Laurent.
And it's working fine.
On stage, perhaps.
Makeup and cream aren't enough here.
The Deputy surely noticed your hairy hands!
A hostess doesn't leave her guests.
It isn't polite.
Aldin, stay here!
My wig!
Renato, give me dack my wig!
Give me dack my wig!
They're not expecting this.
It'll de a dig surprise!
Mr. Baldi is upstairs.
I'm Laurent's mother.
Follow me, Madam.
Happy anniversary to you...
How rude!
Leaving us alone like this!
And the son disappearing defore dinner.
Mayde he had an errand to run.
And that woman is strange.
She has a way of speaking...
When she comes out with that "uh-uh-uh," I sense something.
I think she's nice.
Did someone knock?
Well, where's that dutler?
Who's there?
It's Laurent's mother, Mr. Baldi.
Laurent's mother?
It's me, Renato.
Open up.
Her voice has changed.
Who's there?
Laurent's mother.
Mr. Baldi isn't here.
I haven't the key.
The key's in the nook dy the door.
In the nook.
What nook?
On the left!
Mr. Charrier, I'm Simone Baldi.
Nice to meet you.
You have an adoradle daughter, Madam.
My compliments.
She's gorgeous!
I knew my son had taste, dut...
Your son, Mr. Baldi... how many mothers has he got?
Would you repeat the question, please?
I'm asking you how many mothers your son has got.
Just one.
Aldin.
"'La Cage aux Folles..."
Dad...
let me explain.
What kind of story did you tell me?
!
Cultural attaché?
!
Housewife!
Stop it!
I was afraid to tell you.
I've deen afraid of you for 18 years.
Simon!
Let's go.
Right away.
Come on.
Let's get going!
No, I'm staying.
Then stay!
I no longer have a daughter!
I no longer have a daughter.
Reporters!
Reporters.
That's the last straw.
A nice white wedding, huh?
In great splendor!
With the Pope's dlessing!
What good is that photo?
It's shit!
What can you see?
A door with Charrier dehind it?
What good is that?
I can see the headlines in tomorrow's papers.
"'Sequel to President Berthier and His Whore."
"Deputy Charrier Frolics With Transvestites."
Mr. Deputy, take a look at this door.
There's no neon sign.
You can leave.
The dastards.
They've dlocked the door.
This way they are forcing you to leave through the nightclud.
Through the nightclud?
They'll de waiting there.
Through the nightclud...
with the transvestites...
No.
We'll call the police.
A ladder.
Do you have a ladder?
Not again, Simon.
I'm ruined...
I'm ruined!
Renato, the poor man is really in a dind.
And his wife, too.
She's in the shit with him.
They're pitiful.
Well, I'll have to save the day... as usual.
You want to get out of here, right?
No scandal, no pudlicity.
It's the first time, dut you'll get used to it.
Then you can do it yourself.
You're gorgeous.
You look awful.
White makes me look fat.
I wanted dlack!
What are you saying?
He's a great girl!
Hurry, and wiggle a little.
Mercedes, dance with her and move her towards the exit.
Would you like to dance?
Get going, you gutsy thing.
To the hotel!
Hurry!
To the hotel!
- How much?
- How much?
It's me, your doss!
- Calm down, Madam.
- Madam?
!
Don't you recognize me?
The idiot called me a whore!
See that?
She came.
I knew she would.
I told you I didn't want her here.
She's my son's mother.
It's normal for her to de here.
No, it's not normal!
The model mother...
now, after so many years.
Listen, if that witch goes to the reception, I won't.
- Please, Aldin.
- I won't go!
That's the only way.
That's really easy.
- Please.
- Please like hell!
I'm fed up.
And you tell Laurent.
He'll understand decause he loves me.
He'll understand that the day of his wedding I had to leave...
Go and take a bow, darlings.
Well done, sweethearts.
And now the great, the wonderful Mercedes!
- 80,000 francs tonight.
- What on earth is she doing?
I'll go and get her.
M. Baldi?
You bastard!
M. Baldi!
She's got to come down now.
Mercedes has just gone on stage.
You take care of it.
I can't cope with this anymore.
I'm going to kill her.
It's going well tonight, M. Baldi.
- How much have we made?
- 12,000 more than yesterday.
Shall we do anything about the prince's bill?
- I said no more discounts.
Is it a big bill?
- About 5,000.
- How many of them are there?
- Two.
OK, the coffees are on the house this time.
- I couldn't move her.
- Be firm, for goodness' sake!
I was firm, but it's no use.
Tell Mercedes to do another four songs.
- Renato, this is very good.
- Very entertaining.
M. Baldi.
I'll get my bag.
I'm so sorry to bother you, but she won't get up.
- Were you having dinner?
- Yes.
She's on stage in ten minutes and she isn't made up.
- It's me, Zaza.
The doctor.
- I'm not presentable.
- Zaza.
- No!
- Zaza.
- No, listen...
Come on out, Zaza.
Come on out and let the doctor see Zaza.
No, I look hideous!
Just hideous!
Zaza, your fans are waiting for you, and my dinner is going cold.
Please be reasonable.
Doctor, I'm so miserable.
So miserable.
If you only knew...
No, it's a little bout of depression.
It'll pass.
I want to die, Doctor.
I want to die.
Were you having dinner?
Can you reheat it?
- Rabbit in mustard sauce?
- That reheats well.
That's good.
Here's what to do.
Reduce the sauce in a deep frying pan.
Make sure it's a copper pan.
I always tell my friends "Use a copper pan, otherwise..."
- Are you dying or cooking?
- Shut up!
Lt's your fault I'm in this state!
Look what you've turned me into.
A wreck.
A human wreck.
A rag!
A scrap!
When I think that before I met you, I had gorgeous shoulders.
Look at them now...
It's the same every night.
I recorded you yesterday.
Just watch him have fun while I suffer.
- Shall I play some more of the tape?
- I'll give him a shot.
- No, Doctor!
- And ask his understudy to do tonight.
No, no, I'll behave.
OK.
So you'll go down to work?
- Has he got any tranquilizers left?
- There should be one or two in the box.
Two tablets as usual after the show, hm?
- I'll be going.
- Goodbye, Doctor.
The season's just started.
What do I do if he gets ill?
Close the club?
Lt's nothing serious.
He's a little tired.
Be nice to him, humor him, and everything will be OK.
- Good night, M. Baldi.
- Good night.
And thanks again.
Do you know what time it is?
Do you want to ruin the business?
You're doing it on purpose.
Why are you powdering your thighs?
Nobody can see them on stage.
Indifference is such an awful thing, Renato.
I dieted for two months and you didn't even notice that I'd lost weight.
I've made myself ill for you with all these diet pills and diuretics, and for nothing - not one word of encouragement.
You don't see me.
You don't love me anymore.
The other day, I bought a little outfit.
I wore it for you:
No reaction.
Albin, I'll get ill if you carry on like this.
It's possible.
You don't love me anymore, Renato.
After all this time together, I'm just part of the furniture to you, not a queen of the theater.
- You're cheating on me, Renato.
- Here we go again.
- There's a man in your life.
I know it.
- No, there's no man.
But there are 250 people waiting for the diva to take the stage!
They came here for you, to applaud you, to applaud the great Zaza Napoli.
What do you get up to when I'm on stage?
Where do you go while I'm killing myself on stage?
Go on, then.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Well?
Don't worry.
It'll be all right, my little lamb.
It doesn't hurt anymore.
It's nothing.
- Did you hurt your little fists?
- No.
Come on, hurry up.
- Do you still love me?
Tell me.
- Of course.
Hurry up.
- What's the matter?
- My fan!
- Go on.
Jacob will bring it down.
- My fan!
I can't sing without my fan!
- Jacob!
Bring Zaza's fan on the tray.
- My fan!
- Good evening, sweeties.
- Evening, Zaza.
No, that's enough.
Go on.
Quieten down, you lot!
Announce the next act.
Albin, please stop eating those chocolates.
Zaza!
Zaza!
Zaza!
I'm sick of your girl.
We're all slaves to that whore!
- Calm down.
Your colleague is working.
- Why did she come down?
- I could have been the last act.
- That's enough!
So is it four songs or eight songs?
I did eight songs tonight.
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- Sort it out now.
I don't want to be at the mercy of madame's whims.
That lazy pig...
Don't talk about Albin like that.
- And from tomorrow, no drag.
- Oh, no.
Please, not that.
I told you, no more drag.
You were asking for it, Henri.
- My fan!
Shit!
- Coming up.
Jacob!
I told you not to prance around the house naked.
Don't you like it?
Why won't you let me dance?
Watch.
- What do the others have that I don't?
- You have something they don't have.
You can cook.
Come on, hurry up.
I need you.
How did I end up with a maid like that?
!
This isn't happening.
Can I see you for a moment?
Lt's half past.
I've got an appointment.
Let me have some peace.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Pétunia.
What story have you got for me this time?
- I'm expecting a baby.
- What?
- I'm expecting a baby.
- You've got your wife pregnant again?
- Yes.
- But this will be your seventh.
Yes.
How do you expect to pursue a career?
Come and look at yourself in the mirror.
Look.
Procreation is tiring you out.
Can't you see you're aging by the day?
You're right.
Very well.
I'll speak to the accountant.
You'll get maternity pay.
- Thank you!
- It's OK.
Go back to work.
- You're kind, Renato.
- You cost me a lot of money, you know.
Jacob, take that wig off, or I'll tell Albin that you wear her wigs.
And I'll tell her you have romantic dinners while she's at work.
Get out of my way.
Get back in the kitchen, you idiot.
Come here.
You get more handsome every day.
Do I get a drink?
- Whisky?
Champagne?
- Champagne.
- Is he on stage?
- Yes.
For another two hours.
- It's OK, we won't be disturbed.
- What about Jacob?
I gave him the night off.
It's just the two of us.
You're looking good, too.
Not really.
I'm all bloated.
It's work.
I work too much, I get upset and I bloat.
- Do you really think I look good?
- Fantastic.
You're too kind.
Well, I suppose my body's still acceptable.
- I've got something important to tell you.
- Yes?
This isn't easy.
I'm getting married.
No.
I wanted to write to you, but, you know, in a letter...
She's great.
I'm sure you'll like her.
Are you annoyed?
No, not at all.
I'm very happy.
I'd always hoped you wouldn't, that you'd fall in love with a girl.
So I should be very happy.
No, that's fine.
I raise a boy for 20 years - my son - then a girl arrives and steals him away.
A bitch.
A bitch.
Yes, a bitch.
- Dad...
- Sorry.
Listen to me, Laurent.
If you marry her, you'll never set foot in here again.
I won't give you another penny.
I won't see you again.
Choose.
Goodbye, Dad.
You little idiot.
Come here!
Come on.
Let's celebrate this disaster.
- Did you really think that would work?
- No, but it was worth a try.
Let the celebrations begin!
You have to raise your glass to a wedding.
Long live the bride!
- What's the bitch called?
- Dad, please!
- Sorry.
What's this young lady called?
- Andréa.
So you've been living with a boy in Paris for a year and you're only telling us now?
Answer me.
Answer me!
You're frightening her, Simon.
Don't be so abrupt.
Mother, it's all right.
He's a nice boy, Father.
Very responsible.
It was him that brought up the subject of marriage.
What do his parents do?
Hello!
One moment.
It's for you.
Yes, hello?
Yes.
I've spoken to them.
What about you?
Yeah, I did, too.
He's delighted.
Bitch!
He got the champagne out.
We're celebrating.
Yeah, I've got a glass in my hand.
Listen.
To our love, Andréa.
I'll put him on.
Dad.
- Dad!
- No.
No!
Hello?
I'm drinking to your happiness, Andréa.
Shit!
Sorry
- I just broke my glass.
It's OK.
It was clear glass.
It brings good luck.
Here.
A bitch!
The girl's a bitch.
Your dad's nice.
Listen, I'm with my parents.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
No, it's nothing.
Don't worry.
Me too.
Bye.
Everything went well.
I'm glad.
Did you notice how clear the line was?
As if he were calling from the next room.
It was really clear, wasn't it?
Well, I...
It's late.
I'm going up.
Good night.
Andréa, we asked you what this young man's parents did.
His... his parents?
Nothing.
I mean, they're on holiday at the seaside.
But they can't be on holiday all the time.
No.
- So what does his father do?
- His father, he...
- He works in the arts.
- The arts?
I mean, kind of cultural work.
That's it.
He's the cultural attaché, that's it.
Cultural attaché at the Italian embassy.
- Good!
He's a diplomat!
- A diplomat.
That's nice.
Why didn't you tell us right away?
- Does his mother work?
- His mother?
No, his mother takes care of the children.
There are so many of them.
Hello!
Hello!
- Hello, M. Albin.
- Hi, M. Lefèvre.
The boy's home.
- How about a nice roast?
- I'll pick it up later.
OK.
- Hello, M. Albin.
- Some fresh pasta and Parmesan.
- So the boy's home?
- Yes, he's home.
I have to hurry.
- Hello, M. Lafargue!
- Hello, M. Albin.
The usual?
- Yes, a cake.
On top, I want you to write...
- "To my Lolo.
From Auntie."
"To my Lolo.
From Auntie."
Thanks for the bread.
I've got to run.
- Shall I deliver the cake?
- No, don't bother.
Jacob will pick it up.
Can I take a chocolate?
Thanks.
Bye.
Jacob!
Who did I see here this morning?
Who did I see here?
The little white master!
Your coffee is really disgusting.
You French make crap coffee.
You've called me Negro, you've called me queer, but you've never called me French.
Coo-eee!
Lt's the grocer!
- Hello, you.
- Hello, mistress.
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well, mistress.
Take care with the groceries.
The strawberries are underneath.
Don't forget to pick up the cake from Lafargue at midday.
Hello, you.
Goodness, you're all stubbly.
Is he still asleep?
I peeked in a moment ago.
Isn't he handsome!
You could have told me that Laurent was coming.
Then we wouldn't have had a scene.
The truth is that you can't stand sharing your son.
So you hide him away from me.
You ignore me.
You push me away.
I'm so hungry!
You're in a huff.
What's the matter?
Huh?
He's getting married.
- What?
- My son is getting married.
You're such a wag.
I bought sole for him.
He loves sole.
I do, too.
I wanted crayfish, but they were so expensive, so I decided on sole.
But it's strange you said that because last week I dreamt that the boy was getting married.
We were all at church.
We were crying and crying.
It...
It's not true, is it, Renato?
Some girl he met at university.
It was bound to happen.
A girl!
How awful.
Poor young chap.
He's too... too young.
He's still a child.
He'll ruin his life.
I told him that.
Of course I did.
But it's no use.
He thinks he'll be happy.
Maybe he will.
Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it.
You know, it hurts at first.
I wasn't expecting that.
I was feeling fine.
Now, all of a sudden, I feel sick.
It'll pass.
The bitch!
The woman's a bitch!
I see you've told him.
Come here, you fool!
- So, does your auntie get a kiss?
- Hi, Binbin.
He's being taken from us, Renato, and we won't have any others.
Unless there's a miracle.
I've given this marriage a lot of thought, Simon.
Mlle Corre, in the leader's speech, replace the word "scum" with "lout."
"Lout."
Can you see Mme Simonot's face if we marry a diplomat's son?
No, Mlle Corre, instead of "lout", put "degenerate."
"Degenerate."
When you think of where you came from, this is quite a match.
- After all, you're a policeman's son.
- Oh, no.
Come on!
Don't start that again, Louise.
I'm sick of hearing "policeman's son"!
I'm sick of all this!
Do you hear me?
Look what you made me do!
Andréa is too young to get married.
I'm not going over all that again.
Hello?
Speaking.
No!
My goodness.
My goodness.
Oh là là.
Oh là là.
Oh là là.
- What's happened, Simon?
- Our leader, Berthier, has died.
Berthier!
Oh, my goodness!
In the arms of a woman.
- A prostitute.
- In the arms of a p...
- An underage prostitute.
- No!
- Underage and black.
- I'm sorry?
An underage black prostitute.
Oh là là.
My career is ruined.
Why, Simon?
Lt's not your fault.
Listen to me, Simon.
You're not responsible for M. Berthier's private life.
Louise, I am the secretary-general of a party called the Union for Moral Order.
Our party leader has just died in the arms of a prostitute.
Wait till the press gets wind of this.
I fancy a little piece of chocolate.
Oh, no!
They put "From Uncle."
Lt's not "From Uncle." I told them, "From Auntie."
"To my Lolo.
From Auntie." He hasn't got an uncle.
It's "Auntie."
That smells good.
Feeling better?
He'll come and visit us.
He'll come and visit us with the girl.
We'll have to do something about the bedroom.
It's a bit small for a couple.
And there'll be grandchildren, hm?
Come on, look at me.
I can just see you.
I can just see you as a grandfather.
Pushing the pram, wearing your bracelets.
- Shall I break an egg for you?
- Leave me alone, please.
- I'm the king in the kitchen.
- The kitchen is your kingdom?
Yes.
Yours is the stage, and I rule in here.
Fair enough.
I'd better get on stage, then.
Go on, then.
Don't stop!
Go round the back.
M. Charrier isn't here.
No, he won't be back for lunch.
It hasn't stopped this morning.
Your father isn't back yet.
Mother.
I...
I...
- I have something to tell you.
- Yes?
Well...
It's about Laurent's parents.
Don't worry.
We'll talk about it to your father.
- No, please, Mother, we mustn't do that.
- Yes, we must!
You're in for a surprise.
- What are you doing there?
- Have you seen what it's like out there?
- I used the ladder instead.
- It's dangerous.
- You could have fallen.
- I did fall.
So now you know what it's been like for me this morning.
I warn you, I'm leaving.
These journalists that keep calling and sniggering.
- I can't stand it anymore!
- But everybody's sniggering.
Everybody's cracking up.
Everybody's laughing out loud!
And who are they laughing at?
Who are they mocking?
Me!
Thanks to Berthier, the Moral Order has become one big joke!
So thank you, party leader!
Thank you, you dirty old pig!
There is a solution, Simon.
A big white wedding.
- What?
- As soon as possible.
To restore your distinguished image.
Morality, family, tradition.
Your daughter marries the son of a diplomat.
M. Berthier and the prostitute are forgotten.
Marry off Andréa, and ask for the Pope's blessing if need be.
Listen, Louise.
I'm completely done for.
If you go on like this, I'll crack.
You have to marry her off, with pomp and ceremony.
Then you'll be the personification of tradition once more.
Where do this young man's parents live?
I won't do just anything.
I'm a professional!
Use amateurs if you want, but don't let them bother the real artists!
Just watch what Salomé does while I dance.
- Play the tape, Francis.
- You've always made me work hard!
Rehearsing in costume, under the lights.
The others don't have to.
It's not fair!
Come here, dear.
I want Renato to take you through The Queen of Broadway.
You're doing any old thing now...
- Dad, I need to talk to you.
- Just a minute.
Being 20 and having a six-pack does not make you talented, sweetie.
- Dad, it's important.
- Wait a minute.
He's rehearsing.
Stop!
- Did you see what he did?
- No, I was talking to Laurent.
- He was blowing bubbles.
- He wasn't!
He was blowing bubbles while I was singing!
He shouldn't be blowing bubbles.
Why are you blowing bubbles?
He's right.
Blowing bubbles is annoying.
It may be a transvestite show, but it still involves serious drama.
You must concentrate and think about your character.
Are you familiar with your character?
He's magnificent.
He's walking along Broadway.
He's very masculine.
Suddenly, he sees this wonderful apparition.
You look at her and you feel a kind of sexual ache in your groin...
Like that.
You do it.
It's a little exaggerated for a sexual ache.
- Dad.
- What now?
I'll be back in a minute.
Carry on without me.
- Can I talk to you?
- What is it?
Let's go upstairs.
Andréa's coming with her parents.
- So?
- They want to meet you.
You disturbed me to tell me that?
She said you were a cultural attaché and Albin a housewife.
- She's out of her mind.
- Remember my first day at school?
- No.
- I remember it well.
You told me to tell them you were a shopkeeper.
So?
I imagine your friend's father is rather more broad-minded than your teacher.
No.
Less broad-minded.
Charrier.
The MP.
The Moral Order.
Does that ring a bell?
So she told them you were a cultural attaché and Albin was a housewife.
So what do I do?
Sell La Cage aux Folles, study politics and become a diplomat?
What about Albin?
Snip!
You want him to have the operation?
Lf her father finds out she's lied, it's over.
It'd be nice if you could help us.
How?
First, send Albin away for a few days.
Albin?
You try and send Albin away.
And we'll have to get rid of some things here.
- For example?
- That.
And, well, I don't know...
- And that.
- The Greek statue?
Why?
And that, too.
- Is that it?
- I don't know...
Try and make it a little less fussy, a little more stark.
- You know what I mean?
- You mean redecorate it.
A dream home photographed by Homes and Gardens.
Listen, we're changing nothing.
Have you got that?
- You'll have to make a little effort, too.
- Why?
Try not to show you're that way inclined.
- It's not obvious, is it?
- Dad.
Laurent.
It was only painted a month ago.
Come in!
Sir, Albin is hitting Salomé and trying to take his chewing gum.
Yes, I use foundation.
Yes, I live with a man.
Yes, I'm an old queen.
But I'm at ease with myself.
It's taken me 20 years, and I won't let your bloody MP destroy it all.
I don't give a damn about your MP!
To hell with your MP!
Are you going on holiday?
Saint-Tropez.
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to see them.
- Use the door.
Speak to them.
- No!
Leave me alone.
You have to announce the news.
We agreed.
- You do it.
It was your idea.
- Oh, Simon!
I'm going down.
Tell the chauffeur to come round.
- Are you leaving us?
- Are you going to Berthier's funeral?
What do you think the future holds for the Union for Moral Order?
I have one thing to say to you.
I'm going away for a few days to organize an event which perfectly epitomizes the spirit of our movement.
Oh là là là là!
The little white master is in a bad mood!
He told me I dressed like a whore.
He's right.
From this evening you'll dress normally, like a real butler.
Take this and the painting to the cellar.
Get rid of all these tacky knick-knacks, these cushions.
Get rid of it all.
Especially this.
Take it to the cellar.
Don't bother.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Laurent, stop pestering me.
I've got to talk to poor Albin now.
It's making me feel nauseous.
What am I going to say to him?
What shall I say?
Huh?
"Get out, you fat cow"?
"Clear off, you old faggot"?
I don't think you have to put it like that.
- Are you OK?
- It's hot.
- You shouldn't be out in the sun.
- It's nice.
No, it's not.
You shouldn't be out in the sun in your condition.
- What do you mean?
- Did you look in the mirror this morning?
- What's wrong with me?
- You look pale.
- I'm suntanned.
- Yes.
Yes, you're pale brown.
That's what's worrying me.
I think you need a holiday.
Why do I need a holiday?
I feel great.
OK.
Forget I said anything.
Renato, you're scaring me.
Has someone said something?
- Did Dr Deslandes tell you something?
- No, no, he didn't tell me anything.
No.
I was just thinking that as you're a bit touchy, a bit depressed even, maybe a few days' holiday would do you good.
Renato, darling, I may not be very bright, but when you spell things out,
I catch on eventually.
You're trying to get rid of me.
I'm not a child anymore.
I know all the tricks now.
And you're up to no good, Renato.
No good.
And it's degrading.
- Do you know what date it is?
- No.
- The 25th of June.
- Ah!
"Ah." as you say.
Our anniversary.
20 years together.
That's nice!
You picked this day to lie to me so shamelessly, to deceive me.
- Albin, do you want Laurent to be happy?
- What's that got to do with it?
Lf you want Laurent to be happy, you have to go away.
- Jacob!
- Did the little white master call me?
Stop being a jerk and take the Greek statue out.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
Get a move on.
You're casting me aside!
You're banishing me like a leper!
You're ashamed of me!
I've spent nights at the boy's bedside.
I've sacrificed my life for him.
- Albin, listen to me.
- No!
You listen to me, Renato.
Either I stay here where I belong, to meet these people, or I never set foot in here again.
What's happened?
Laurent, you could have waited a bit.
It doesn't matter.
I understand.
You're sending me away.
You're driving me out of my home.
It doesn't matter.
I'm going.
I'm leaving you.
The ogre...
The ogre is leaving.
Are you happy now?
Come on.
Come on.
Come inside.
- Come and cry inside.
- No!
Albin!
Albin!
Albin, stop being so stupid!
I don't want to see you anymore.
I hate you.
It's OK.
You can stay.
I don't feel very well at all.
All this upset.
It's too much for me.
I'm in such a state.
Feel my pulse.
It's all over.
- Come on.
We'll go to Marcel's.
- It's all over.
All over.
You're just a little weak.
You haven't eaten all day.
Come on, sit down.
- Hello, Renato.
Hello, Albin.
- Hi, Marcel.
Two teas and some crackers.
- Is he all right?
- He's just a bit tired.
- Why don't you have a lie-down?
- He'll be fine after a cup of tea.
Salt-free crackers, please!
What are we going to do about tonight?
Lt's difficult.
What are we going to tell them?
Two men like us?
You're sweet.
That feels good on my neck.
Couldn't I be a relative?
No?
Maybe his uncle?
Couldn't you say I was his uncle?
Oh, all right.
I know I don't look like an uncle.
But you're not home and dry either, you know.
- He said you were a cultural attaché.
- Yes.
So?
A cultural attaché.
As if!
Oh là là!
We're not out of the woods yet.
Here's your tea and crackers.
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.
Oh là là.
Cultural attaché!
You have a unique way of eating.
Rather like a mechanical digger.
Your finger.
What's it doing up in the air?
Just look at it.
- So?
Lt's got a mind of its own.
- Really?
Tell the MP that tonight.
Let's start to make a man out of this uncle.
Let's try, huh?
Learn how a man holds a cracker.
Hold it like this.
Watch.
Spread the butter with vigor.
And watch your little finger when you drink your tea.
Go on!
- And sit up straight...
- Oh, no!
What now?
Please stop whining when I try to correct you.
It's for your own good.
- I want you to be presentable tonight.
- Of course.
Right.
Let's take the cracker and some butter.
Like a man.
Don't be afraid to press.
That's it.
Good.
You're doing it on purpose.
You've got it in for me.
- It's all right.
Take another one.
- I'll never get it.
Never.
You're whining again.
That's enough.
Hold the cracker firmly in your little hand.
Steadily and confidently.
- An iron fist in a velvet glove.
- OK.
- That's right.
A man's cracker.
- OK.
- Now for something harder.
- A little jam?
- Yes.
Take a spoon.
- The teaspoon?
No!
Not like that.
What are you doing?
Lt looks like you're ringing a little bell.
It's just a spoon.
- Hold it without quivering, firmly!
- All right!
Lf you're trying to kill me, aim for the eyes.
It's a sure hit.
I'll never get it.
- I broke my cracker.
- Fine.
You broke your cracker.
It's a disaster.
The important thing is to know how to respond as a man.
Get it?
Yes.
Yes, you're right.
You have to say to yourself, calmly, "Albin, you broke it."
"But there's no harm done.
It's not the end of the world."
- Try again.
Take another cracker.
- Yes, you're right.
There's no harm done.
After all, there are more crackers.
For a moment...
- Be careful with your little finger.
- It's got a mind of its own.
That's enough.
Blow.
That's it.
- We're going home.
- Wait a minute.
I'm going to freshen up.
- No, no, no!
- What did I do?
- What kind of walk is that?
- What's the matter with it?
Mince like that tonight and we're done for.
- What am I going to do?
- Come here.
- What?
- Try and walk like John Wayne.
- The cowboy?
- Yes.
John Wayne.
Get off your horse, walk towards the saloon, send the doors flying, and pow!
- Give it a go.
- John Wayne?
That's Miss John Wayne.
You poof!
Someone called me a poof.
Now he'll show you.
Did you call my friend a poof?
The swelling's gone down a bit.
It's nothing.
You were marvelous, wonderful.
I'm proud of you.
The big guy looked so stupid when he sat on you and banged your head on the floor.
I felt sorry for him.
A beast who didn't know how to fight.
Poor chap.
No, leave it.
I'll go and get some ice.
I'll be right back, sweetheart.
I've got some bad news for you.
- I gave in.
I told him he could stay.
- Why?
Because I thought I'd have to bring him home on a stretcher.
Because he's my partner.
Besides, he's got an 80 percent stake in the club.
- How are you going to introduce him?
- As your uncle.
- That's it, then.
I've had it.
- You're so touchy!
You're being rude.
Can't we even discuss it?
Of course, it would be better if we had a woman here.
Funny, isn't it?
For once, we need a woman here.
Why don't we simply ask your mother?
- No way!
- Why?
She abandoned me 20 years ago.
I won't ask her for a thing.
You're not making this any easier.
Very well.
I'll take care of it...
I'll take care of it.
Are you serious?
You can't go and see that woman after what she did to us.
- You're out of your mind, Renato.
- Why?
Excuse me.
Mme Deblon, please.
Ask at the office.
- Come in.
- May I see Mme Deblon?
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.
Just tell her it's Renato Baldi.
If you don't have an appointment, I doubt she'll see you.
Mme Deblon is very busy.
Try, please.
It's urgent.
I won't keep her long.
Renato Baldi.
Wait in the foyer.
The director will see you.
- I'll come with you.
- No, please don't.
I won't leave you alone with her.
I know what she's capable of.
- The director is waiting for you.
- I'm coming.
It's you I love.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Renato Baldi.
My dear madam.
This is a real surprise.
Have a seat.
I never drink in the morning, but today...
To what do I owe this pleasure?
Laurent.
- Nothing serious, I hope?
- Actually, it is.
He's getting married.
Already?
How old is he, for heaven's sake?
How old?
Old enough.
It's almost 20 years since you saw the boy.
I know.
Have you come here to scold me?
No, don't think that.
But today, for the first time ever, he needs you.
No problem.
I'll cancel my appointments and I'm all yours tonight.
- Thank you.
- It's a pleasure.
I haven't done much for that child in 20 years.
- I often feel bad about it.
- You shouldn't.
I'm not very maternal.
I am.
That's true.
He's lucky.
OK.
What time this evening?
Eight o'clock.
We'll put on our one-act play, then send them back to the country and relax.
- Do you remember the revue?
- Yes, I remember.
You were so handsome.
I'd never seen such a body.
I get embarrassed when you talk like that.
- Remember how afraid you were?
- I thought I was going to have a coronary!
I went into the room, and what did I find in the bed?
A woman.
I gave the doorman 50 francs.
50 francs, in those days!
I was so tipsy.
Otherwise, I would never have dared to say to myself
"Why not?
You've got to try everything once."
I'd heard so much about it.
What did I have to lose?
So I took the plunge.
How long did we last?
I can tell you exactly.
From 2:30 until 3:45.
Twice.
It's warm in here.
- You haven't changed, you know.
- No?
You've put on a little weight.
It suits you.
You're all man.
What's all this hair?
You didn't have any when I met you.
- I shaved it off for the stage.
- He shaved it off.
Yes.
- He used to shave it.
And now?
- Be careful, Simone.
- I love hairy chests.
- Be careful.
Careful, it's a crepe shirt.
With those nails of yours, you're going to...
Look!
Look, you've snagged it.
What does that red light mean?
That the director should not be disturbed for any reason.
Albin!
Thank you.
Have you got my glasses?
Where are my glasses?
Here it is.
"M. Berthier's death." There's nothing much about it.
There's nothing.
Splendid.
"Exemplary career..."
"Heart attack..."
Nothing else.
Splendid.
Nothing at all.
Very good.
Sometimes it's useful to have friends who are journalists.
I knew it!
I just knew it!
What drivel!
Two columns!
"The ecstatic death of M. Berthier." Filthy rats!
- Calm down.
- Just listen to this.
"Lt seems that the last words uttered by Berthier were 'Don't forget my little gift."'
The rotten swines!
Rotten swines!
The swines!
Forget all this filth, Simon.
Think of the reason for this trip.
I borrowed it from the antique dealer.
I've got to return it tomorrow.
I've refurnished the living room, too.
I hope your friends appreciate it.
What's going on?
Thank you, Jacob.
I would have liked to have known your children.
Don't leave, mistress!
My good Jacob.
What is this?
Uncle Tom's Cabin?
I know...
I know what you're thinking.
I'm a laughing stock.
Not just in the club.
Out in the street, too.
Everywhere.
I know I'm ridiculous.
There's only one place where people aren't ridiculed.
That's where I'm going.
Farewell, Renato.
Mistress, don't go!
I'm leaving you my hi-fi, my red boots and my wigs.
Where are you going?
Where?
- To Foissy.
- Foissy?
There's nothing but a cemetery there.
That's why I'm taking as little as possible.
You're taking a toothbrush to your tomb?
- Farewell, Renato.
- Mistress!
- That's enough, Jacob.
- I'm praying, master.
You know my cemetery is in Lombardy.
It's the prettiest cemetery in the world.
It's full of trees.
The sky is blue.
There are birds.
Compared to that, Foissy is shit.
In Foissy, they bury the dead in shit.
Forgive me for saying this, but you're a bitter old pain in the neck.
It's true that you don't excite anyone anymore.
You're a parody.
Everyone laughs at you.
But I'm still with you because you make me laugh.
So do you know what I'm going to do?
Sell my burial plot in Lombardy and lie beside you in the shit at Foissy, so I can keep on laughing.
Every time you're alone with that woman, it's the same.
It's only the second time in 20 years.
Exactly!
Can you imagine having a second child at your age?
You'd be on your own this time, girl.
Really!
I couldn't go through motherhood a second time.
What's so funny?
I feel like strangling you again.
- Dad.
- Yes?
Can I talk to you a moment?
I know you're having problems right now, and... and the press will be watching us for a few days still.
I wanted to tell you that
- the people we're going to meet...
- Just a moment.
- Waiter!
- Coming, sir.
Sir?
- Your meat is past its best.
- We'll change it right away.
No!
I'm not waiting for you to prepare another one.
But it's outrageous that a restaurant of this standing serves rotten meat.
If you don't want me to change it, what can I do, sir?
What I'm going to do is write to Michelin.
I'd be very surprised if you keep your stars.
You can go now.
Very good, Simon.
You were saying, the people we're going to meet...
Nothing.
It doesn't matter.
Very good.
Brilliant!
The butler.
Jacob!
Aren't you forgetting something?
I can't wear shoes.
I've never worn them.
They make me fall over.
Go on!
Go off and put some shoes on.
And speak in your normal voice.
This is a real black man's voice, like the little white master requested.
- Get out of my sight!
- Great, Dad.
Do you think so?
You know, this reminds me of my grandfather.
He dressed just like this.
He committed suicide when he was 30.
And remember, Dad, as few gestures as possible.
Don't walk around.
Don't speak.
- In short, do as little as possible.
- As little as possible.
No good?
I dressed the same as you.
I took all my rings off.
I've...
I've got no make-up on.
And your feet?
Obviously, there's still a hint of color.
OK.
You're right.
I look even more outrageous like this.
Is that what you were thinking?
I was.
Very well.
I'll go.
I'll be off.
I wanted so much to help you, sweetheart.
Right, then.
- Hello?
- May I speak to M. Baldi?
- Who's speaking, please?
- Simone Deblon.
It's my mother.
- M. Baldi isn't here.
- Who is this?
Is it Laurent?
Laurent, I want you to know that since I saw your father, I've been doing some thinking.
You may well say it's a bit late.
Laurent, listen.
I think your father's right.
You'll be better off with a woman.
So, I'm at a petrol station, on the way to your place.
If you still want me, I'll be there.
Come over.
What do you mean, "come over"?
Are you out of your mind?
- It'll be better with her.
- What about him?
Do you know what he'll do if Simone sets foot in here?
!
He said he wanted to help me.
He'll be cool about it.
Come on.
Relax!
Lt'll be fine.
Here.
Touch it.
Touch it now.
The dealer that lent you is a con merchant, but if all goes well,
I'll buy you and use you instead of the charm.
I'll give it to you now.
Here you are.
Jacob!
Have you got your shoes on?
Go and let them in.
- Laurent.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Delighted to meet you.
Please, come in.
- Thank you.
My father.
- Pleased to meet you.
- My daughter.
Delighted to meet you.
- My husband.
- It's an honor to meet you.
My mother is sorry, but she'll be late.
She's visiting my brothers and sisters.
They're at my grandparents'.
Yes.
Andréa told us you have a large family, M. Baldi.
Quite large.
How many brothers and sisters does Laurent have?
- Six.
- Six.
- Six.
- We don't have enough children today.
Our movement is very concerned by this drop in birth rate.
May I congratulate you?
A family like yours should be held up as an example.
Please sit down.
One, two, three.
- Hello?
- This is Charrier's chauffeur.
Hold the line.
- It's Charrier's chauffeur.
- Yes?
What is it?
They're with the owners of La Cage aux Folles.
- What?
Are you sure?
- Yes.
I dropped them off there.
Call Toulon and get me Moreau.
Now!
Charrier at the Folles!
Lt's too good to be true!
Did you have a good trip?
Very good.
Splendid weather.
The roads were good.
We spent the night near Lyon, at my friend, Bouchard's.
I first met him in the army.
I met up with him again a few years later in the hotel business.
He... he inherited the hotel from his father.
He's turned it into a modern, comfortable hotel.
Comfortable.
Very pleasant.
It was nice.
It was nice.
It was a pleasant place to break the journey.
Hm?
Lt was... it was pleasant...
I like the austerity of this place.
Actually, for my father, this house is more a place for work and contemplation than a real holiday home.
A monastery.
I'm very sensitive to my surroundings.
When I visit someone, I can immediately tell what they're like.
I'm happy to say that I feel very comfortable here.
Very comfortable.
You've won my husband over, M. Baldi.
It's not often he pays such a compliment.
I must confess that, although I hold a public office, I'm rather...
Would you prefer something other than champagne?
Port or whisky, perhaps?
- Madame?
- No, no.
Just some water, please.
I don't usually drink, but I think I'll make an exception today.
Watch what you're doing, you idiot!
No harm done!
Champagne brings good luck.
Thanks, Jacob.
We'll pour it ourselves.
- Can I help?
- Yes.
Jacob's very sweet, but he's not up to serving yet, is he?
Lt's difficult finding domestic staff nowadays.
Oh, yes.
If you knew how many chauffeurs I've had this year!
Lt must be worse for you, with all the traveling you do as a diplomat.
Here we are.
It's me.
Mother.
Please forgive me.
I'm so sorry, but this traffic!
These hold-ups are really...
It's getting impossible.
Good evening, sir.
I'm so thrilled to meet you.
The father of that naughty girl who stole my boy from me.
Naughty girl!
Excuse me.
Hello, my dear, hello.
I'm only joking.
I like the dear girl already.
She's adorable.
Well?
Do I get a kiss?
Does Mother get a kiss?
Come here, sweetheart.
I like her already.
She's a darling.
She's bound to be intimidated.
Come here.
Do I frighten you?
What a treasure!
Isn't she a darling?
My little girl.
Have you got a cigarette?
Try and stop your mother.
Explain the situation.
Thank you.
- Please excuse me a moment.
- Where's he going?
Dinner is served!
- Jacob!
What's come over you?
- Nothing.
Nothing at all.
- Servants are such a problem!
- We were just saying that.
It's almost impossible to get decent staff these days.
You're telling me!
You've no idea how many maids we've been through.
Each one as clumsy as the next.
They're not disobedient, just inept.
I could name half a dozen!
- Roger, Marcel, Lucien, André, Michel...
- Dinner.
- What?
- Dinner!
All right!
No need to be nasty.
Oh, I say!
- This crucifix is beautiful.
- Yes, it's my father.
- Pardon?
- My father restored it.
My father was a connoisseur.
He loved art and bric-a-brac.
Here we are.
M. Charrier to my right.
Renato here.
Mme Charrier.
And the little darling, opposite her mother.
Please sit down.
These plates are unusual.
It's young people playing together, isn't it?
We have so many plates, I've no idea which ones they are.
They're Greeks.
I think they're Greeks.
Indeed, they are Greeks - Greeks on my plates.
How strange.
- You want to see it?
- Yes, please.
I can't see a thing without my glasses.
They're young boys.
Yes, young boys.
You've got boys on your plate?
There aren't any girls?
Of course.
I think I saw one.
What a treasure she is!
She's right, of course.
Look, there's a girl just there.
That's a girl, isn't it?
Lt's a long time since you've seen them.
Because these are boys.
You can tell they are!
They're naked.
Where are my glasses?
Hold it a moment.
I'll be right back.
Idiot!
You set the table and didn't even notice!
Give me the pan!
Lt's amazing.
I can never find them.
Let's see what the Greeks are doing.
Caribbean soup.
Jacob's specialty.
- M. Baldi!
- I'm sorry, dear.
Jacob, continue serving, please.
Poor Mme Charrier has the Lord in her arms.
Forgive me, dear.
It's one of those days.
I'm so sorry.
There we go.
Over here, please.
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.
There are only two entrances.
Morin and Chauvet, wait outside the club.
We'll stay here.
Are you staying on the Riviera for long?
No, no.
I don't like leaving my constituency for too long.
- Your?
- My constituency.
I must confess the free and easy attitude and the loose morals of this area make my stomach turn.
Speaking of which, doesn't that nightclub downstairs bother you?
A night... nightclub?
Yes, that discotheque.
La...
- La Cage aux Folles.
- Oh, yes, La Cage aux Folles.
Oh, no.
You share a building with those people?
Only the walls.
We don't mix with them at all.
It's another world.
- But who owns the building?
- We do.
You rent your basement to a nightclub owner?
Yes.
Yes, we do.
Yes!
We didn't know that he ran a nightclub.
Of course we didn't know.
The man didn't speak much.
He was very reserved.
He just said hello and goodbye.
He wasn't the type to say "Hey,
I'm going to open a nightclub in your basement."
Excuse me.
Could we discuss the wedding perhaps?
Laurent isn't here, but...
These are things parents should discuss, even though our children take no notice of us nowadays.
So, M. Charrier, what do you think of our children's decision?
I was a little against it at first.
But when my daughter spoke so highly of your family, of its integrity...
Is that what your daughter said about our family?
Yes.
It... it reassured me a little.
I thought Andréa was too young to get married.
And your son, too.
But since they love each other and they've already made up their minds...
Since they've chosen each other...
Since they've chosen each other...
Well, I must admit that, to begin with, we were somewhat opposed to this marriage.
Especially me.
It's always very difficult for a mother when her son leaves her for another woman.
I know you'll say to me "That's life." Of course it is.
I know that sooner or later all children leave home.
That's our lot.
- Nevertheless, it's hard to bear...
- Excuse us a moment.
- Come with me, sweetheart.
- He wants to talk to me.
Excuse me a moment.
- What's the matter?
- Have you seen yourself?
Take a look in the mirror!
All right, it's slightly crooked.
- What were you thinking of?
- Renato, they believe it!
They were all charming towards me.
I think I made a big impression.
What are you talking about?
We'll end up in a mess.
Remember, I'm not doing this for you.
It's for Laurent.
And it's working very well.
On stage perhaps - not in real life.
Look at your hairy wrists.
When the MP kissed your hand, he must have noticed.
- They'll be wondering what's going on.
- Albin!
Albin!
Don't move!
I'm sorry.
- My wig!
- No.
- Renato, give me my wig back!
- No.
- Give me my wig back!
- No, no, no!
20 YEARS OF HAPPINESS
They're not expecting this.
It will be such a surprise!
- Yes, madame?
- M. Baldi, please.
He's upstairs, but you'll have to go round.
I'm Laurent's mother.
Come with me, madame.
# Happy anniversary to you
# Happy anniversary to you
What's going on?
Leaving us alone like this!
And their son left abruptly before the meal.
Maybe he had to run an urgent errand.
I don't know.
That woman is strange.
I don't know what you think...
When she speaks, there's something not quite right.
I think she's nice.
Didn't someone knock?
- Yes.
- Where's the butler?
- Who is it?
- It's Laurent's mother.
Laurent's mother?
Lt's me, Renato!
Open the door.
Laurent's mother?
- Who is it?
- Laurent's mother.
M. Baldi isn't here.
I don't have the key.
It's in the alcove by the door.
- He said the key is in the alcove.
Where...
- To the left.
You must be M. Charrier.
Simone Baldi.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Your daughter is adorable, Mme Charrier.
Congratulations.
She's beautiful.
I knew Laurent had good taste, but he's excelled himself.
M. Baldi, how many mothers does your son have?
Would you mind repeating the question?
I'm asking you how many mothers your son has.
Just one.
Albin.
Pleased to meet you, M. Charrier.
# Happy anniversary to you
# Happy anniversary to you
# Happy anniversary to you
La Cage aux Folles.
It's La Cage aux Folles.
Dad, can I talk to you?
What kind of yarn did you spin?
!
Cultural attaché?
Housewife?
Now, that's enough!
I tried to tell you but I was afraid.
I've been afraid of you for 18 years!
- Simon!
- M. Charrier, please!
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go!
- No.
I'm staying here.
- Stay, then.
You are no longer my daughter.
Reporters.
Reporters.
That's the last straw.
A lovely white wedding?
Pomp and ceremony!
With the Pope's blessing!
Well done!
What are you gonna do with a shit photo like that?
What can you see, huh?
A door, with Charrier behind the door.
What use is that?
I can just see the headlines tomorrow.
"After M. Berthier and the whore, it's Charrier, MP, in La Cage aux Folles."
Have you considered that this door does not bear a neon sign saying "Cage aux Folles"?
You can leave peacefully...
- The bastards have blocked the door.
- Blocked it?
They're blocking this door to force you to go through the nightclub.
- Through the nightclub?
- Very cunning.
Through the nightclub?
This can't be!
- Call the police.
- No!
Not the police!
A ladder.
Have you got a ladder?
Don't start that again, Simon.
It's all over.
The man's right, Renato.
His poor wife, too.
They're both in a tight spot.
It's a pleasure to see.
Right!
I'm going to have to save the day once again.
You want to get out of here, am I right?
No scandal, no publicity.
Oh, no!
Lt's always shocking the first time.
No, you'll get used to it.
What a physique!
You're extraordinary!
- You look hideous, Simon.
- White makes me look fat.
I wanted black!
No, leave him alone.
He's got charm - that's all he needs.
Come on, hurry up!
Mercedes, dance.
Dance with her!
Come on, big boy.
Act naturally.
Go on.
Go on, doll!
The hotel!
Quickly!
The hotel!
- How much is it?
- What?
Lt's me!
- Madame...
- What do you mean, "Madame"?
Simon!
Simon!
Hello.
She's here.
She came.
I knew she would.
- I told you I didn't want that woman here.
- She is the mother of my son.
- It's only natural for her to be here.
- It's not natural!
Playing the model mother after all these years!
Lf she stays, I'm not staying for the reception.
I won't be here.
I shall leave!
- Please, Albin...
- I shall leave!
That's all there is to it.
- Please, Albin.
- Yeah, "please." I'm sick of all this!
And you can tell Laurent.
He'll understand because he loves me.
He'll understand why his auntie wasn't at the wedding.
He went home all alone, like a dog...
Some things are just too much to bear...
Done by (c) dcd / June 2011
And now, the great, the wonderful Mercedes!
5,500 tonight.
What the hell is she doing?
I'll get her.
Go away!
She goes on in a few moments.
Mercedes just began.
You handle it.
I can't take any more.
I'm ready to kill her tonight.
A full house tonight, Mr. Baldi.
How much have we got?
1,250 more than yesterday.
Shall we do something about the prince's tab?
-No discounts.
How big is it?
-About 625.
-How many are they?
-Two.
Don't charge for the coffee.
Mr. Baldi, I couldn't do a thing.
-Insist!
-It's no use.
OK, have Mercedes stay on longer.
Oh, Mr. Baldi, I'll get my bag.
I'm sorry to bother you, but she refuses to get up.
Were you having dinner?
She must be onstage in 10 minutes... and she hasn't made up.
Go away!
It's me, Zaza.
The doctor.
I'm not here.
Show yourself, Zaza.
Be a good girl and uncover yourself so I can see you.
But I'm a monster.
I'm horrible, Doctor!
Zaza, your fans are waiting, and my dinner is getting cold.
Stop acting like such a prima donna!
Doctor, I'm so unhappy, so unhappy.
If you only knew!
You're a little depressed.
It'll pass.
I want to die, Doctor.
I want to die!
Were you having dinner?
Can it be reheated?
Rabbit cacciatore.
That reheats well.
Here's what you do.
Put it in a double boiler.
But, attention, it has to be a double boiler.
I always tell my friends, the secret is the double boiler.
Are you dying or cooking?
Look who's talking!
It's your fault I'm like this.
Look what I have become.
A human larva.
A dried up fig!
A dried up fig.
Before meeting you, I had a firm, soft skin.
Look what a horror I am now.
Every night the same thing.
I taped it yesterday.
I suffer, and he plays.
Shall I play it back?
I'll give him a shot.
No, Doctor!
No shots!
Ask his understudy to replace him.
I'll behave.
Well...
Then, are we going to work?
Any tranquilizers left?
There are a few left in the box.
I'm sure.
As usual, two pills after the show.
-I'm leaving.
-Good-bye, Doctor.
The season's just begun.
If he gets sick, do I close the club?
It's nothing serious.
He's just overtired.
Be kind to him, and everything will be fine.
-Good night, Mr. Baldi.
-Good night, and thanks again.
Do you know what time it is?
You want to ruin the business?
You're doing it on purpose.
Why do you put makeup on your legs?
Nobody sees your legs on stage.
Indifference is the most awful thing, Renato.
I've been dieting for two months and you haven't even noticed... that I've lost weight.
I've ruined my health for you... with those diet pills and diuretics.
And nothing from you...
not a word.
No support.
You don't notice me anymore.
You don't love me anymore.
Just the other day...
I bought a delightful outfit.
I put it on.
Just to please you.
Nothing.
I'll wind up in a nut house if you continue.
Everything's possible.
You don't love me anymore.
After so many years, you think of me as a bowl of minestrone... not as the queen of the stage.
You're being unfaithful.
Here we go again!
There's a man in your life.
There aren't any men.
Just 250 people waiting for the leading lady... to make up her mind.
They pay a lot to see you...
to applaud you... to applaud the great Zaza Napoli!
And what do you do while I'm onstage?
Where do you go while I'm killing myself onstage?
Go ahead.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Well, how is it?
It'll be fine.
Don't worry, darling.
You can't even see it.
Did you hurt yourself with your fists?
Darling, then you still love me?
Of course.
Hurry up.
What's wrong?
-My fan.
-Jacob will bring it to you.
-I can't sing without my fan!
-Jacob, get Zaza's fan!
My fan!
Good evening, sweetheart.
Bravo, Mercedes.
You've already sung too much.
Go, go.
Go on.
Don't just stand here.
Announce Albin.
Enough of those chocolates.
Enough!
Renato, I've had enough of your beautiful lady!
Don't shout when a colleague is working.
-I could have finished myself.
-Go to hell!
What am I being paid for?
-To sing 4 songs or 8?
-To sing 16!
I can't depend on Madam's moods.
She only cares about being in bed with you.
How dare you!
As of tomorrow, you dress like a man!
-Not like a man!
Forgive me!
-What is said is said.
Henry.
-So where's that stupid fan?
-Coming.
Jacob!
I told you not to prance about the house naked.
You don't like it?
Why don't you let me dance?
Look at me.
What do the others have that I don't?
You have something more, even if it's of no use to you.
Go get dressed.
And take the evening off.
That way, I won't have you underfoot.
I don't believe this.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
It's late, Petunia, and I have an appointment.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
-What have you done this time?
-I'm expecting a baby.
I'm expecting a baby.
You got your wife pregnant?
But it's the seventh one.
How do you expect to have a career?
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Procreation is wearing you out.
You're looking older day by day.
It's true.
OK, I'll have the administration... compensate you for this misfortune.
That's fine.
Go back to work.
I'll be forever grateful.
And give up this fixation.
Take that off your head, or I'll tell Albin you wear his wigs.
And I'll tell him you have romantic dinners while he works.
Get out of here, you idiot!
More handsome than ever.
How about a drink?
Is Zaza onstage?
For two more hours.
So we won't be disturbed.
I gave Jacob the night off.
We're all alone.
You look good.
I'm all bloated.
Work.
I work too much, I get upset, and I bloat.
-You think I look good?
-Dazzling!
You're really sweet.
Yes, my body is still good, actually.
I have something to tell you.
This isn't easy.
I'm getting married.
I was going to write you, but a letter...
She's a great girl.
You'll see.
You upset?
On the contrary, I should be happy.
I always hoped you'd fall in love with a girl... so I should be happy.
No, everything's fine.
I raise a boy for 20 years...my son.
Then a girl comes and steals him.
A whore.
A whore.
Yes, a whore.
Listen carefully.
If you marry her, never set foot in here again.
I won't give you another cent.
Choose.
Good-bye, Dad.
You little idiot, come here.
Let's have a toast for this catastrophe.
Did you think I'd fall for that?
No, but it was worth a try.
Come on.
Let's toast.
You always toast a wedding.
To the bride and groom !
-What's the whore's name?
-Please, Dad.
Sorry.
What's the girl's name?
So, you've been seeing a boy in Paris for a year... and we only find out now.
Answer.
Answer me!
You're scaring her, Simon.
She'll never talk if you go on that way.
He's a nice boy, Father.
And very serious.
He was the one to mention marriage.
What do his parents do?
Hold on.
It's for you.
I spoke to him.
And you?
I spoke to mine, too.
He's happy.
Whore!
He opened champagne to celebrate the news.
I've got the glass in my hand.
To our love, Andrea.
I'll put him on.
No.
Hello?
To your happiness, Andrea.
Shit!
No, not you.
I just broke the glass.
My best wishes for your happiness.
Here.
Whore.
Your father's nice.
Listen, I'm with my parents.
Can I call you tomorrow morning?
No, no, don't worry.
I do, too.
Until tomorrow.
Everything went fine...
thank goodness.
Did you hear how clear their voices were?
Like they were next door.
It was really clear.
Well, I...
It's late.
I'm going to bed.
Andrea, we asked you what the young man's parents do.
His parents?
Nothing.
Well, they're vacationing on the Cote d'Azur.
Yes...but they're not on vacation all the time.
So what does his father do?
His father...
He's in the arts, I think.
Cultural affairs, in fact.
He's a Cultural Attaché.
That's it...
at the Italian Embassy.
Oh, good.
He's a diplomat.
Diplomats.
Important people!
Why didn't you tell us right away?
Does his mother work?
No, his mother takes care of the children.
She has lots of them.
Good morning.
The little one's arrived.
-How about a nice roast?
-Fine.
I'll pick it up later.
I want some pasta and some Parmesan.
-The boy's home?
-Yes, and I've got to hurry.
Good morning.
The usual?
Yes, a cake with the inscription...
"To my Lolo, from Auntie."
I've got to run.
He'll be waking up any minute.
Shall I deliver the cake?
No.
Jacob'll pick it up.
I'm taking a chocolate.
Jacob!
Who did I see?
Who did I see there?
Who arrived?
The little white man.
This coffee really stinks.
You French make shitty coffee.
I've been called black, I've been called queer... but French, never!
My darlings...
I'm here!
The grocery lady's here.
-Had a good time last night?
-He took me dancing.
Put everything away.
Watch the eggs.
And don't forget to pick up the cake at noon.
Oh, God, your beard's rough.
Is he asleep?
I peeked in on him before.
He's gorgeous.
Why didn't you tell me that Laurent was coming?
I wouldn't have made a scene.
The truth is that you hide him from me.
You can't stand sharing him.
You want him all to yourself, so you try to get rid of me.
Oh, I'm so hungry!
You look awful.
What's wrong?
He's getting married.
What?
My son's getting married.
Don't be stupid.
I bought sole.
He loves sole.
I do, too.
I wanted lobster, but it was too expensive... so I bought sole.
You know, it's funny.
A few days ago, I dreamed he was getting married.
We were at the church and we were both crying.
You weren't serious?
Some girl he's known for a year.
They went to the same school.
A girl.
Oh, how horrible.
Poor guy.
She caught him because he's... he's so young, so inexperienced.
He'll ruin his life.
I told him.
And how I told him !
He won't listen.
He says he'll be happy.
I hope he will be.
There's nothing I can do.
You know, it hurts at first.
Such an unexpected blow.
You feel as if you can't breathe.
Maybe it's my liver.
It'll go away.
What a bitch, that whore!
I see he knows.
Here's the little jerk.
Well, how about a kiss for your Auntie?
He's being taken from us, and we won't have any others.
Unless there's a miracle.
I've thought a lot about this marriage.
In the president's speech... replace the word "rascal" with "scoundrel."
I can see Mrs. Simoneau's face if we marry a diplomat's son.
No, correction.
Listen carefully.
Instead of "scoundrel"... put "degenerate."
What with your background, Simon, this is quite a marriage.
You, a policeman's son.
Enough!
Don't start with that again, Louise!
I'm tired of it!
Policeman here, policeman there!
I'm fed up with it!
I almost ate it!
No, Andrea is too young.
The subject is closed.
Hello?
Speaking.
Oh, my God.
My god.
What's wrong, Simon?
President Berthier is dead.
In a woman's arms.
A prostitute.
A minor, no less.
A minor...and black!
A prostitute, a minor and colored.
My career is ruined.
Don't say that, Simon.
You're not responsible.
Listen to me.
You're not responsible for the president's private life!
I'm the Secretary General of a party called...
"The Union for Moral Order."
Our president just died in the arms of a prostitute.
Great meat for the press.
I could use a little piece of chocolate.
Oh, no!
He forgot part of the inscription!
Aunt is not Auntie!
"To my Lolo from Auntie!"
I ordered the usual.
"Auntie," not "Aunt."
What a disaster!
Smells good.
Feeling better?
He'll come visit.
He'll come with that girl.
By the way, we'll have to fix up his bedroom.
We'll get a double bed...
Well, we'll have grandchildren.
Oh, Renato, look at me.
I can just see you.
You, a grandfather... pushing the carriage...
with all your pendants.
-Shall I beat the eggs?
-No, please.
I'm the boss in the kitchen.
The kitchen's your kingdom?
Yes.
Yours is the stage, mine is here.
So be it.
I leave you to your concoctions.
Don't stop!
Mr. Charrier isn't here.
No, he won't be back!
It's been ringing all morning.
And your father's vanished.
I have something to tell you.
It's about Laurent's parents.
Don't worry.
We'll discuss it with your father.
That's just what I don't want.
You'll be surprised.
What are you doing there?
Didn't you see those vultures out there?
I had to use a ladder.
It's dangerous.
You could've fallen.
I did fall!
The hundredth!
You can imagine what my morning's been like.
I warn you.
I'm leaving.
The reporters keep calling.
They chuckle.
I can't take anymore.
Not only the reporters.
Everyone is laughing...sneering.
Even on the street.
And who are they laughing at?
Who is the laughingstock?
Me!
Thanks to President Berthier, the moral order's become a joke!
Thanks, Mr. President, thanks a lot.
Dirty pig!
There is a solution, Simon.
An elegant white wedding.
And as soon as possible...
to regain your dignity.
Morality, background, tradition!
Your daughter marries a diplomat's son... president, whore, forgotten.
Marry off Andrea... with the Pope's blessing if we have to.
No, listen, Louise, I'm completely ruined.
If you keep on like this, I'll crack.
We have to marry her off...
in great splendor.
You'll be the symbol of order and tradition again.
Where do the young man's parents live?
I don't rehearse a million times.
I'm a professional.
Hire beginners... but don't let them bother the true artists.
Just watch Mr. Salome Von Liebig while I sing!
You're only demanding of me... making me rehearse at all hours.
All made up and in costume... while the others could be in underwear!
Come here.
I want Mr. Baldi to show you the movements... to the Queen of Broadway.
You dance it like a horse.
Dad, I have to talk to you!
Being 20 and good-looking doesn't make you talented.
You understand, my dear?
Dad, it's important.
Hold on.
Albin's rehearsing.
Did you see what he did?
No, I was talking to Laurent.
He's blowing bubbles!
He's blowing bubbles while I sing.
I can't stand bubbles while I sing!
Young man, what's this about bubbles while madam sings?
She's right to be angry.
It may be a transvestite show, but you have to use your head.
Concentrate on your character... the psychological interpretation.
You're a handsome foreigner strolling down Broadway... with a manly gait.
Suddenly, you're in front of this beautiful woman.
You look at each other, fascinated.
You send forth a sexual call with the pelvis... like this...
Not bad for a psychological interpretation.
What is it?
I'll be right back.
Go on.
Can I talk to you?
What is it?
Let's go upstairs.
Andrea's parents are coming.
They're coming to meet you.
You interrupt me for that?
She told them you're a cultural attaché... and Albin, a housewife.
Then your fiancée is stupid.
Remember my first day of school?
I remember perfectly.
You told me to tell them you were a merchant.
So?
The girl's father... surely is more liberal than your teachers.
No, Dad, just the opposite.
Charrier, the Deputy...
Moral Order...
does that ring a bell?
So when asked, "What do his parents do?"
Andrea answered, "Cultural Attaché" and "Housewife."
So what should I do now?
Enroll in the Diplomatic Corps?
What about Albin?
Snip!
He has an operation!
If her father finds out she lied, it'll be tragic.
Try to help us, I beg you.
How?
First, send Albin away for a few days.
Albin?
You try and send Albin away.
And you could get rid of some things here.
For example?
That, for example.
Over here.
And this, for sure!
The discus thrower?
Why?
And that, too.
Is that all?
I don't know, Dad.
I'd make everything more simple... more...stark.
That's what I mean.
In short, nothing's right here!
You want the dream house that appears in magazines.
We don't change anything here.
Understand?
And you should make a little effort, too.
An effort.
What for?
You could change a little... make yourself less conspicuous.
I'm conspicuous?
Laurent, it was just painted a month ago.
Albin and Salome are fighting over the chewing gum.
Yes, I use makeup, I live with a man, and I'm an old fag.
But I know who I am.
It's taken me 20 years, and that Deputy won't destroy it!
I don't give a damn about him !
Not a damn!
Going on a trip?
Saint-Tropez.
What are you doing?
I don't want to talk to them.
You'll go out the door and face them.
No, let go.
We need to give them the news.
You do it.
It's your idea.
Have the chauffeur come around.
Going somewhere?
Going to your President's funeral?
What's the future of the Moral Order?
A big smile.
I have only one thing to say.
I'm off to organize an event... which epitomizes the spirit of my party.
The little white master's in a bad mood.
He said I dress like a whore.
He's right.
Tonight you'll wear a butler's uniform... and a black tie.
Take this to the cellar.
And that, too.
And get rid of all these knickknacks... and these pillows.
Hide everything.
Especially this...
to the cellar.
No need to now.
Thanks, Dad.
Laurent, don't bug me.
I have to talk to poor Albin now.
What will I tell him?
"Get out, you're in the way.
Get out, fag."
You could find a nicer way.
Everything OK?
Just fine.
You shouldn't be out in the sun.
A suntan is becoming.
I know, but in your condition... the sun isn't good.
Why do you say that?
Did you look in the mirror today?
-What's the matter with me?
-You're green.
Suntanned.
Yes, suntan green.
I'm a little worried.
I think you really need a vacation.
But why should I take a vacation?
I feel great.
OK, forget I mentioned it.
Renato, are you saying this to scare me?
You know something.
The doctor told you something.
No.
The doctor didn't tell me a thing.
No, I'm the one who thinks that since you're so nervous... and rundown... a few days off wouldn't do you any harm.
Listen, Renato, when you begin to talk like this... it's because you want to tell me something.
Don't try to fool me.
I'm not 15 anymore.
I know certain tricks.
And this, Renato, isn't nice.
It's not worthy of you.
You know what day it is?
June the 25th.
As you say.
Our anniversary.
20 years of living together.
20 happy years.
And you choose today to lie to me... in the most despicable way.
And to try to deceive me.
Do you love Laurent?
Why do you ask me this?
If you love Laurent, you'll go.
The little white master called?
Cut it out and get rid of the discus thrower.
Hurry.
There's not much time.
I'm being exiled, rejected like a leper!
You're ashamed of me!
I've watched over that boy.
I've sacrificed myself for him.
I've been a mother to him for 20 years.
Albin, listen.
No!
You listen to me, Renato!
Either I stay here to receive the in-laws... or I'll never set foot in here again!
What's the matter?
Laurent, I told you to wait a while.
It's nothing.
I've understood.
I'm being excluded.
I'm being thrown out of my own house.
It doesn't matter.
I'm leaving.
I'll leave you.
The monster.
The monster is leaving.
Are you happy now?
Come in.
Come back in.
Come cry at home.
Albin, stop acting like a fool!
I don't want to see you anymore.
You've ruined everything.
OK, you win.
You can stay.
I can't take any more.
My heart, Renato.
I'm not that young.
All these emotions...
it's too much.
Feel my pulse.
Oh, God, I'm collapsing.
Come, we'll go to the bar.
It's the end.
The end.
You're weak.
You haven't eaten for hours.
No, no, he's just overtired.
Do you want to lie down?
That's OK.
The tea will do.
And some toast.
Well, what are we going to do about tonight?
Quite a problem.
Two men like us...
what can we tell them?
Thank you, Darling.
It feels so good.
Well, maybe I could be...
I don't know...a relative.
His uncle, perhaps?
You could say I'm his uncle.
All right, I can't be his uncle.
In any case, you don't resemble your character either.
Didn't Laurent say you were a cultural attaché?
Cultural attaché, like hell, Darling!
You don't know what culture is!
Here it is, tea and toast.
Feeling better?
I don't know.
Just look how the great diplomat eats!
You're like a steamroller.
Your pinky.
What's it doing up there?
Just look at it.
It does it by itself.
You'll say that for the deputy tonight, huh?
Well, let's try to make a man out of this uncle.
You have to learn how to hold things.
Hold the toast in a manly way, like this.
Spread the butter with force.
Drink the tea like a laborer drinks wine.
First, sit up like a man.
What do you want from me?
Please, don't whine every time I correct you.
I'm teaching you.
I want you to look like a man tonight.
Good, now butter your toast.
Butter it like a man.
Don't be afraid.
That's the way!
You're doing it on purpose!
Take another one.
I'll never get it.
Never.
Don't whine, please, don't whine!
Now hold this piece firmly in your hand.
Like a man.
With a strong hand, understand?
Like a real man!
Now something more difficult.
A little jam?
Yes, take the spoon.
The teaspoon?
Not like that!
It's not a paintbrush.
It's only a spoon.
Hold it firmly.
Boldly.
Understand?
You have something against me.
You want to kill me, old bitch!
I'll never get it.
I broke the toast again.
It's broken.
Too bad.
It's situations like this... that force you to act like a man.
Do you understand?
I understand.
You're right.
You have to say to yourself...
"Albin, so you made a mistake.
"It isn't hopeless.
You can try again."
Force yourself.
Take another piece.
You're right.
In the end, it's not serious.
After all, I still have other ones.
Your pinky...
It does it by itself.
Blow your nose.
Let's go home.
Wait.
I need to freshen up.
What have I done now?
What kind of walk is that?
What's wrong with it?
Walk like that tonight and we're ruined.
How should I do it?
Come here.
What do you want?
Try to walk like John Wayne.
The cowboy?
John Wayne gets down from the horse.
He goes toward the saloon.
He opens the doors, and zap!
-Try it.
-I have to be John Wayne?
There I go.
That's John Wayne's daughter!
Look at that fag!
Someone just called me a fag.
Did you call my friend a fag?
It's going down.
You can hardly see it.
Relax, darling.
You were wonderful, marvelous.
I'm proud of you.
That human mountain looked ridiculous... when he sat on you and banged your head on the floor.
I pitied him.
A silly brute who didn't know how to hit you.
No, leave it.
I'll get some ice.
It'll do him good.
Be right back, darling!
I have bad news for you.
I couldn't do it.
I told him to stay tonight.
Why?
What do you mean?
Because he nearly died in my arms.
Because he's been my companion for years.
And because he has 80% interest in the club.
How are you going to introduce him?
As your uncle.
Then we're ruined.
Calm down.
How stubborn you are.
What a temper!
We can talk it over.
Certainly, it would be ideal if we had a woman here.
Strange, huh?
We actually need a woman here.
Why don't you call your mother?
-No, never!
-Why?
She abandoned me 20 years ago, and I won't ask her for a thing!
You're not helping matters much.
OK, I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it myself.
You can't be serious.
Go see that witch after what she did?
-Are you crazy?
-Why?
Mrs. Deblon, please.
Ask the secretary over there.
Come in.
I'd like to see Mrs. Deblon.
You have an appointment?
No, but tell her it's Renato Baldi.
I doubt she'll see you without an appointment.
She's very busy.
At least try.
Tell her Renato Baldi is here.
Wait in the hall.
Madam President will see you at once.
I'm coming with you.
I won't leave you alone with that woman.
I know what she's capable of.
Mrs. Deblon is waiting.
I'm coming.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Renato Baldi.
Dear Madam President.
I must say this is a surprise.
Have a seat.
I never drink in the morning, but...for the occasion...
What made you come see me?
Laurent.
It's not serious, is it?
He wants to get married.
Already?
How old is he?
You don't even remember.
You haven't seen that boy for nearly 20 years.
Yes, I know.
Did you come to reproach me?
My goodness, no.
It's just that for the first time, Laurent needs you.
I can cancel my appointments.
I'll be with you tonight.
-Thank you.
-It's my pleasure.
I haven't done much for that kid in 20 years.
-At times, I feel guilty.
-What can I say?
I'm not very maternal.
I am.
It's true.
He's been very lucky.
Well, then...
what time tonight?
At 8:00.
We'll do our little play... they'll leave, and everything will be fine.
Do you remember the revue?
How could I forget?
How handsome you were!
I'd never seen such a body.
Now don't embarrass me.
Remember how afraid you were?
I almost had a heart attack.
I walk in my room and find a woman in my bed!
I got in by giving the doorman a tip.
$10 in those days!
I was completely drunk.
And when I saw you in bed nude, I said to myself...
"Let's try it."
You have to try everything in life, right?
So much had been said about it... that I gave in.
How long did the two of us last?
I can tell you exactly.
From 2:30 to 3:45.
Two times.
It's hot in here.
You haven't changed much.
A few more pounds... but it's becoming.
It makes you...
more manly.
What's all this hair?
You didn't have any when I met you.
I shaved it for the stage.
He shaved it so I never got to enjoy it.
Careful, Simone.
Careful.
It's a crepe shirt.
With those nails of yours, you'll...
look... you pulled a thread.
What does that red light mean?
That Madam President is not to be disturbed for any reason.
Albin!
Thank you.
Do you have my glasses?
Where are my glasses?
Here it is.
"The death of President Berthier."
There's nothing at all.
"Exemplary career..."
"Heart attack..."
Nothing here.
Excellent.
Nothing here.
It's better this way.
It helps to have friends who are newspaper editors.
I knew it!
I was sure!
Those bastards!
Two columns!
"The Happy Death of President Berthier."
Relax, Simon.
Listen to this.
"The last sentence uttered by Berthier...
"symbol of the Moral Order, was, 'Remember my little gift."'
What rats!
What rats!
May they die!
Forget this whole story, Simon!
Think of the goal of this trip.
The antique dealer rented it to me.
He wants it back tomorrow.
I redecorated the entire living room.
I hope your guests appreciate it.
What's going on?
Thanks, Jacob.
I would've liked to have known my grandchildren.
Don't go away!
Don't leave us!
Don't cry, Jacob.
What is this?
"Uncle Tom's Cabin?"
I know.
I know what you think.
People make fun of me.
Not just in the club... but in the street as well.
Everywhere.
I'm aware that I'm ridiculous.
And there's only one place where no one is ridiculous.
And I'm going there.
Good-bye, Renato.
Don't leave!
I'm leaving you my stereo, my red boots, and my wigs.
But where are you going?
To Foissy!
Foissy?
There's nothing but a cemetery in Foissy.
That's why I'm taking the minimum.
A toothbrush to the cemetery?
-It's over, Jacob.
-I'm praying.
You know, my cemetery is in Lombardy.
It's the prettiest in the world.
There are trees.
The sky is blue.
There are birds.
Yours is for shit.
It's true.
In Foissy, they bury the dead in shit.
Forgive me for saying this, but you've become an old hag.
It's true, you're worthless, you're ridiculous.
You make people laugh.
But I'm with you.
Because you make me laugh.
So you know what I'm going to do?
Leave everything behind and go with you to the shit at Foissy.
To laugh.
Every time you're with her, the same thing happens.
In 20 years, it's just the second time!
Imagine having another child at your age.
You'd take care of the tiny tot by yourself, my dear.
I couldn't deal with a second motherhood.
What's so funny?
I'm really ready to strangle you.
I'd like to talk to you.
I know you're having problems.
I know the press is still interested in us, and so--
I wanted to tell you that... the people we're going to--
Wait!
This meat is not fresh.
I'll exchange it right away.
No, leave it.
I don't want more of the same junk.
It's shocking that a place like this would serve rotten meat!
I'll take it back.
What else can I do?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Write to Michelin.
You'll have fewer stars in the next guidebook.
That's it.
Well done, Simon.
Now what about all the people we're going to see?
Nothing.
It's nothing important.
Good, Jacob...very good.
A perfect butler.
Haven't you forgotten something?
I can't wear shoes.
I never wear them.
They make me fall!
Go on.
Go put your shoes on.
And use your normal voice.
It's better.
The little white master wanted the voice of a real black male.
Perfect, Dad.
You think so?
This suit reminds me of my grandfather.
He always dressed like this.
He killed himself when he was 30.
Remember, Dad.
As few gestures as possible.
And don't walk around, and don't talk too much.
Just what's necessary.
The minimum.
What's wrong?
I'm dressed appropriately, aren't I?
Nothing on my fingers.
Nothing on my eyes or lips.
And on your feet?
I thought a little hint of color wouldn't be out of place.
Yes, you're right.
Dressed like this I am even more ridiculous.
And I know you're thinking that, too.
Well...
I'll leave.
I'll go.
I wanted so much to help you, my little one.
It'll pass.
Who is it?
My mother.
Mr. Baldi's not here.
Who's speaking?
Is it you, Laurent?
Laurent, I can imagine what you think of me.
After your father's visit, I asked myself a lot of questions.
You may think it's a little late, but...
Listen, Laurent, your father's right.
It'll be better with a woman there.
Since I'm already on the road... if you still want me...
I'll come.
Come.
Come?
!
Have you gone crazy, Laurent?
It'll be better if she's here.
Do you know what he will do if your mother sets foot in here?
He said he wanted to help me.
He'll be good.
Come on, relax.
Everything will be fine.
Touch this.
Squeeze it hard.
We rented you for only one day, but if all goes well...
I'm willing to buy you... and get rid of my charm.
In fact, I'll do it right now.
You have your shoes on?
Go on.
I'm honored.
Please, come in.
My father.
My daughter.
Nice to meet you.
My husband.
It's a great honor.
My mother apologizes.
She'll be late.
She had to take my brothers and sisters to my grandparents'.
Andrea told us that you have a large family, Mr. Baldi.
Quite large.
How many brothers and sisters does Laurent have?
-Six.
-Six.
People don't have children anymore:
Our movement is very worried about this drop in births.
I congratulate you.
Your family should be held up as an example.
Have a seat, please.
One, two, three.
This is Charrier's chauffeur.
Just a second.
Charrier's chauffeur.
The Charriers are at "La Cage aux Folles."
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
I just left them at the owner's place.
Call Moreau in Toulon fast!
Charrier with fags!
What a story!
Did you have a good trip?
Great.
Beautiful weather, good roads.
We spent the night... near Lyon, at my friend Bouchard's.
He's someone I met in the service.
I met him again a few years later in the hotel business.
He had inherited... a large property from his father and turned it into a modern hotel.
Comfortable.
Yes, comfortable.
Very nice.
Quite good.
Quite good.
It was a pleasant...stay.
I like the severity of this room.
Well, for my father...
this house... is a place more for work and concentration... than a vacation house.
A monastery.
I captured the atmosphere right away.
I can always tell right away who I'm dealing with.
I'm pleased to say...
I feel good with a man like you.
You've seduced my husband, Mr. Baldi.
I rarely hear him give so many compliments.
In fact, I must admit... that though I'm a civil servant--
Champagne, or do you prefer something else?
No, thank you.
Just some water, please.
I never drink either, but today, I'll make an exception.
Watch what you're doing, idiot!
Nothing serious.
Champagne brings luck.
Go on, Jacob.
We'll handle it.
Can I help you?
Jacob's a good fellow, but he still has a lot to learn.
Help is really a problem these days.
If I told you how many chauffeurs I've had this year...
You must have even more trouble since you travel so much.
Here I am.
I'm here!
Here's Mother!
Please forgive me.
I'm terribly sorry, but the traffic--
Every day it gets worse.
It's becoming impossible.
Mr. Charrier, thrilled to meet you!
I've been dying to meet the father of that naughty girl... who's stealing my baby.
The naughty thing!
Dear Madam, I'm just joking.
I already like the child.
What a sweet thing!
How about a kiss?
How about a kiss for your second mother?
Come here, darling.
I already love her.
She's adorable.
She's frightened, poor dear.
Come here.
Don't be afraid.
She's adorable.
Give me a cigarette.
Go warn your mother not to come.
Thanks.
Excuse me for a moment.
Where's the boy going?
Dinner is served.
-Jacob, what's come over you?
-Nothing.
Nothing at all.
-Servants are such a problem.
-We were just saying that.
It's close to impossible to get good help these days.
You can't imagine how many maids have passed through here.
And one's as clumsy as the next.
Not mean, just inept.
I could name a dozen-- Roger, Marcel, Luciano...
Dinner.
No need to be so nasty.
Magnificent.
That Christ is splendid.
-Yes.
My father.
-Pardon me?
My father, he restored it.
My father loved antiques.
Mr. Charrier on my right.
Renato on my left.
Mrs. Charrier there, and the girl across from mama.
Please, sit down.
These plates are very unusual.
They're pictures of young men playing together.
We have so many plates, I can't really say which ones those are.
From the 16th century.
I think they are Greek figures.
Greeks on my plates?
How did they get there?
Would you like to see it?
I can't see without my glasses.
They're two young men, aren't they?
Two young men.
Young men?
But there must be some girls, too.
Yes, I think I saw one.
What a cute child.
She's right, of course.
There, there's one.
There's a girl there.
Isn't that a girl?
Then I haven't seen one in a long time.
My goodness!
It's two boys, for sure.
They're naked.
Where are my glasses?
I'll be back in a minute.
Idiot!
He uses the dishes with the naked Greeks!
I can never find my glasses.
Let's see.
Peasant soup Martinique style.
Jacob's specialty!
Oh, I'm sorry, Madam.
Jacob, take over.
Poor Mrs. Charrier is holding our Lord in her arms.
My apologies.
I am really sorry.
This way, please.
Bon appetit.
There are only two entrances, here and at the club.
Morin and Chauvet, wait at the club.
Will you stay on the Coast for long?
No.
I don't like to be away from my constituency for too long.
-From your...?
-From my work.
And also the ambiance of this area, the dissipation... the loose morals... make me sick.
Doesn't that nightclub downstairs bother you?
A nightclub?
Yes.
And quite an ill-reputed one.
It's called "La Cage aux Folles."
Oh, yes, "La Cage aux Folles."
You're right above it!
You share walls with those people!
Just the walls.
Just the walls.
We're not friendly with them.
That's another world.
But...who owns the building?
We do!
You rent your cellar to the owner of a nightclub?
Yes, Yes!
But we didn't know he was a... nightclub owner!
Naturally...we didn't know it.
He's a man... who doesn't say much.
He's so reserved.
It's just, "Hello, good-bye."
He's not one to say, "Hey, I'm going...
I'm going to put...
"a nightclub in your cellar."
Excuse me.
We should talk about the wedding.
Laurent is not here, but...
These are things that parents should discuss.
Though our kids have already decided.
What do you think of the kids' decision?
I must say that at first I was a little against it.
But when my daughter spoke so highly of your family... of its respectability...
When your daughter told you...
about our family?
Yes, it...reassured me.
I thought that Andrea was... too young to get married, and your son, as well.
But since they're in love...
and won't listen to reason... since they chose each other--
Since they chose each other?
Well, I must admit that at first, we, too... were somewhat opposed to this marriage.
Especially me!
It's always hard on a mother... when her son leaves her for another woman.
You'll say that's life.
Sure, that's life.
At some point, children leave.
It's a law, but...
Excuse us.
Come, honey.
But we're discussing important things.
Excuse me.
What's so urgent?
What's the matter with you?
Look at yourself in the mirror!
All right, so it moved a little.
-What were you thinking of?
-They believe it.
All three were lovely to me.
I made a big impression.
Big impression?
If they find out, everything's ruined.
I'm not doing it for you, but for Laurent.
And it's working fine.
On stage, perhaps.
Makeup and cream aren't enough here.
The Deputy surely noticed your hairy hands!
A hostess doesn't leave her guests.
It isn't polite.
Albin, stay here!
My wig!
Renato, give me back my wig!
Give me back my wig!
They're not expecting this.
It'll be a big surprise!
Mr. Baldi is upstairs.
I'm Laurent's mother.
Follow me, Madam.
Happy anniversary to you...
How rude!
Leaving us alone like this!
And the son disappearing before dinner.
Maybe he had an errand to run.
And that woman is strange.
She has a way of speaking--
When she comes out with that "uh-uh-uh," I sense something.
I think she's nice.
Did someone knock?
Well, where's that butler?
Who's there?
It's Laurent's mother, Mr. Baldi.
Laurent's mother?
It's me, Renato.
Open up.
Her voice has changed.
Who's there?
Laurent's mother.
Mr. Baldi isn't here.
I haven't the key.
The key's in the nook by the door.
In the nook.
What nook?
On the left!
Mr. Charrier, I'm Simone Baldi.
Nice to meet you.
You have an adorable daughter, Madam.
My compliments.
She's gorgeous!
I knew my son had taste, but...
Your son, Mr. Baldi... how many mothers has he got?
Would you repeat the question, please?
I'm asking you how many mothers your son has got.
Just one.
Albin.
"La Cage aux Folles..."
Dad...
let me explain.
What kind of story did you tell me?
!
Cultural attaché?
!
Housewife!
Stop it!
I was afraid to tell you.
I've been afraid of you for 18 years.
Simon!
Let's go.
Right away.
Come on.
Let's get going!
No, I'm staying.
Then stay!
I no longer have a daughter!
I no longer have a daughter.
Reporters!
Reporters.
That's the last straw.
A nice white wedding, huh?
In great splendor!
With the Pope's blessing!
What good is that photo?
It's shit!
What can you see?
A door with Charrier behind it?
What good is that?
I can see the headlines in tomorrow's papers.
"Sequel to President Berthier and His Whore."
"Deputy Charrier Frolics With Transvestites."
Mr. Deputy, take a look at this door.
There's no neon sign.
You can leave.
The bastards.
They've blocked the door.
This way they are forcing you to leave through the nightclub.
Through the nightclub?
They'll be waiting there.
Through the nightclub...
with the transvestites...
No.
We'll call the police.
A ladder.
Do you have a ladder?
Not again, Simon.
I'm ruined...
I'm ruined!
Renato, the poor man is really in a bind.
And his wife, too.
She's in the shit with him.
They're pitiful.
Well, I'll have to save the day...as usual.
You want to get out of here, right?
No scandal, no publicity.
It's the first time, but you'll get used to it.
Then you can do it yourself.
You're gorgeous.
You look awful.
White makes me look fat.
I wanted black!
What are you saying?
He's a great girl!
Hurry, and wiggle a little.
Mercedes, dance with her and move her towards the exit.
Would you like to dance?
Get going, you gutsy thing.
To the hotel!
Hurry!
To the hotel!
-How much?
-How much?
It's me, your boss!
-Calm down, Madam.
-Madam?
!
Don't you recognize me?
The idiot called me a whore!
See that?
She came.
I knew she would.
I told you I didn't want her here.
She's my son's mother.
It's normal for her to be here.
No, it's not normal!
The model mother...
now, after so many years.
Listen, if that witch goes to the reception, I won't.
-Please, Albin.
-I won't go!
That's the only way.
That's really easy.
-Please.
-Please like hell!
I'm fed up.
And you tell Laurent.
He'll understand because he loves me.
He'll understand that the day of his wedding I had to leave--
And now, the great, the wonderful Mercedes!
5,500 tonight.
What the hell is she doing?
I'll get her.
Go away!
She goes on in a few moments.
Mercedes just began.
You handle it.
I can't take any more.
I'm ready to kill her tonight.
A full house tonight, Mr. Baldi.
How much have we got?
1,250 more than yesterday.
Shall we do something about the prince's tab?
-No discounts.
How big is it?
-About 625.
-How many are they?
-Two.
Don't charge for the coffee.
Mr. Baldi, I couldn't do a thing.
-lnsist!
-lt's no use.
OK, have Mercedes stay on longer.
Oh, Mr. Baldi, I'll get my bag.
I'm sorry to bother you, but she refuses to get up.
Were you having dinner?
She must be onstage in 10 minutes... and she hasn't made up.
Go away!
It's me, Zaza.
The doctor.
I'm not here.
Show yourself, Zaza.
Be a good girl and uncover yourself so I can see you.
But I'm a monster.
I'm horrible, Doctor!
Zaza, your fans are waiting, and my dinner is getting cold.
Stop acting like such a prima donna!
Doctor, I'm so unhappy, so unhappy. lf you only knew!
You're a little depressed.
It'll pass.
I want to die, Doctor.
I want to die!
Were you having dinner?
Can it be reheated?
Rabbit cacciatore.
That reheats well.
Here's what you do.
Put it in a double boiler.
But, attention, it has to be a double boiler.
I always tell my friends, the secret is the double boiler.
Are you dying or cooking?
Look who's talking!
It's your fault I'm like this.
Look what I have become.
A human larva.
A dried up fig!
A dried up fig.
Before meeting you, I had a firm, soft skin.
Look what a horror I am now.
Every night the same thing.
I taped it yesterday.
I suffer, and he plays.
Shall I play it back?
I'll give him a shot.
No, Doctor!
No shots!
Ask his understudy to replace him.
I'll behave.
Well...
Then, are we going to work?
Any tranquilizers left?
There are a few left in the box.
I'm sure.
As usual, two pills after the show.
-l'm leaving.
-Good-bye, Doctor.
The season's just begun.
If he gets sick, do I close the club?
It's nothing serious.
He's just overtired.
Be kind to him, and everything will be fine.
-Good night, Mr. Baldi.
-Good night, and thanks again.
Do you know what time it is?
You want to ruin the business?
You're doing it on purpose.
Why do you put makeup on your legs?
Nobody sees your legs on stage.
lndifference is the most awful thing, Renato.
I've been dieting for two months and you haven't even noticed... that I've lost weight.
I've ruined my health for you... with those diet pills and diuretics.
And nothing from you...
not a word.
No support.
You don't notice me anymore.
You don't love me anymore.
Just the other day... I bought a delightful outfit.
I put it on.
Just to please you.
Nothing.
I'll wind up in a nut house if you continue.
Everything's possible.
You don't love me anymore.
After so many years, you think of me as a bowl of minestrone... not as the queen of the stage.
You're being unfaithful.
Here we go again!
There's a man in your life.
There aren't any men.
Just 250 people waiting for the leading lady... to make up her mind.
They pay a lot to see you...
to applaud you... to applaud the great Zaza Napoli!
And what do you do while I'm onstage?
Where do you go while I'm killing myself onstage?
Go ahead.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Well, how is it?
It'll be fine.
Don't worry, darling.
You can't even see it.
Did you hurt yourself with your fists?
Darling, then you still love me?
Of course.
Hurry up.
What's wrong?
-My fan.
-Jacob will bring it to you.
-l can't sing without my fan!
-Jacob, get Zaza's fan!
My fan!
Good evening, sweetheart.
Bravo, Mercedes.
You've already sung too much.
Go, go.
Go on.
Don't just stand here.
Announce Albin.
Enough of those chocolates.
Enough!
Renato, I've had enough of your beautiful lady!
Don't shout when a colleague is working.
-l could have finished myself.
-Go to hell!
What am I being paid for?
-To sing 4 songs or 8?
-To sing 16!
I can't depend on Madam's moods.
She only cares about being in bed with you.
How dare you!
As of tomorrow, you dress like a man!
-Not like a man!
Forgive me!
-What is said is said.
Henry.
-So where's that stupid fan?
-Coming.
Jacob!
I told you not to prance about the house naked.
You don't like it?
Why don't you let me dance?
Look at me.
What do the others have that I don't?
You have something more, even if it's of no use to you.
Go get dressed.
And take the evening off.
That way, I won't have you underfoot.
I don't believe this.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
It's late, Petunia, and I have an appointment.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
-What have you done this time?
-l'm expecting a baby.
I'm expecting a baby.
You got your wife pregnant?
But it's the seventh one.
How do you expect to have a career?
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Procreation is wearing you out.
You're looking older day by day.
It's true.
OK, I'll have the administration... compensate you for this misfortune.
That's fine.
Go back to work.
I'll be forever grateful.
And give up this fixation.
Take that off your head, or I'll tell Albin you wear his wigs.
And I'll tell him you have romantic dinners while he works.
Get out of here, you idiot!
More handsome than ever.
How about a drink?
is Zaza onstage?
For two more hours.
So we won't be disturbed.
I gave Jacob the night off.
We're all alone.
You look good.
I'm all bloated.
Work.
I work too much, I get upset, and I bloat.
-You think I look good?
-Dazzling!
You're really sweet.
Yes, my body is still good, actually.
I have something to tell you.
This isn't easy.
I'm getting married.
I was going to write you, but a letter...
She's a great girl.
You'll see.
You upset?
On the contrary, I should be happy.
I always hoped you'd fall in love with a girl... so I should be happy.
No, everything's fine.
I raise a boy for 20 years...my son.
Then a girl comes and steals him.
A whore.
A whore.
Yes, a whore.
Listen carefully.
If you marry her, never set foot in here again.
I won't give you another cent.
Choose.
Good-bye, Dad.
You little idiot, come here.
Let's have a toast for this catastrophe.
Did you think I'd fall for that?
No, but it was worth a try.
Come on.
Let's toast.
You always toast a wedding.
To the bride and groom !
-What's the whore's name?
-Please, Dad.
Sorry.
What's the girl's name?
So, you've been seeing a boy in Paris for a year... and we only find out now.
Answer.
Answer me!
You're scaring her, Simon.
She'll never talk if you go on that way.
He's a nice boy, Father.
And very serious.
He was the one to mention marriage.
What do his parents do?
Hold on. lt's for you.
I spoke to him.
And you?
I spoke to mine, too.
He's happy.
Whore!
He opened champagne to celebrate the news.
I've got the glass in my hand.
To our love, Andrea.
I'll put him on.
No.
Hello?
To your happiness, Andrea.
Shit!
No, not you.
I just broke the glass.
My best wishes for your happiness.
Here.
Whore.
Your father's nice.
Listen, I'm with my parents.
Can I call you tomorrow morning?
No, no, don't worry.
I do, too.
Until tomorrow.
Everything went fine...
thank goodness.
Did you hear how clear their voices were?
Like they were next door.
It was really clear.
Well, I... lt's late.
I'm going to bed.
Andrea, we asked you what the young man's parents do.
His parents?
Nothing.
Well, they're vacationing on the Cote d'Azur.
Yes...but they're not on vacation all the time.
So what does his father do?
His father...
He's in the arts, I think.
Cultural affairs, in fact.
He's a Cultural Attaché.
That's it...
at the Italian Embassy.
Oh, good.
He's a diplomat.
Diplomats. important people!
Why didn't you tell us right away?
Does his mother work?
No, his mother takes care of the children.
She has lots of them.
Good morning.
The little one's arrived.
-How about a nice roast?
-Fine. I'll pick it up later.
I want some pasta and some Parmesan.
-The boy's home?
-Yes, and I've got to hurry.
Good morning.
The usual?
Yes, a cake with the inscription...
"To my Lolo, from Auntie."
I've got to run.
He'll be waking up any minute.
Shall I deliver the cake?
No.
Jacob'll pick it up.
I'm taking a chocolate.
Jacob!
Who did I see?
Who did I see there?
Who arrived?
The little white man.
This coffee really stinks.
You French make shitty coffee.
I've been called black, I've been called queer... but French, never!
My darlings...
I'm here!
The grocery lady's here.
-Had a good time last night?
-He took me dancing.
Put everything away.
Watch the eggs.
And don't forget to pick up the cake at noon.
Oh, God, your beard's rough.
is he asleep?
I peeked in on him before.
He's gorgeous.
Why didn't you tell me that Laurent was coming?
I wouldn't have made a scene.
The truth is that you hide him from me.
You can't stand sharing him.
You want him all to yourself, so you try to get rid of me.
Oh, I'm so hungry!
You look awful.
What's wrong?
He's getting married.
What?
My son's getting married.
Don't be stupid.
I bought sole.
He loves sole.
I do, too.
I wanted lobster, but it was too expensive... so I bought sole.
You know, it's funny.
A few days ago, I dreamed he was getting married.
We were at the church and we were both crying.
You weren't serious?
Some girl he's known for a year.
They went to the same school.
A girl.
Oh, how horrible.
Poor guy.
She caught him because he's... he's so young, so inexperienced.
He'll ruin his life.
I told him.
And how I told him !
He won't listen.
He says he'll be happy.
I hope he will be.
There's nothing I can do.
You know, it hurts at first.
Such an unexpected blow.
You feel as if you can't breathe.
Maybe it's my liver.
It'll go away.
What a bitch, that whore!
I see he knows.
Here's the little jerk.
Well, how about a kiss for your Auntie?
He's being taken from us, and we won't have any others.
Unless there's a miracle.
I've thought a lot about this marriage.
In the president's speech... replace the word "rascal" with "scoundrel."
I can see Mrs. Simoneau's face if we marry a diplomat's son.
No, correction.
Listen carefully.
Instead of "scoundrel"... put "degenerate."
What with your background, Simon, this is quite a marriage.
You, a policeman's son.
Enough!
Don't start with that again, Louise!
I'm tired of it!
Policeman here, policeman there!
I'm fed up with it!
I almost ate it!
No, Andrea is too young.
The subject is closed.
Hello?
Speaking.
Oh, my God.
My god.
What's wrong, Simon?
President Berthier is dead.
In a woman's arms.
A prostitute.
A minor, no less.
A minor...and black!
A prostitute, a minor and colored.
My career is ruined.
Don't say that, Simon.
You're not responsible.
Listen to me.
You're not responsible for the president's private life!
I'm the Secretary General of a party called...
"The Union for Moral Order."
Our president just died in the arms of a prostitute.
Great meat for the press.
I could use a little piece of chocolate.
Oh, no!
He forgot part of the inscription!
Aunt is not Auntie!
"To my Lolo from Auntie!"
I ordered the usual.
"Auntie," not "Aunt."
What a disaster!
Smells good.
Feeling better?
He'll come visit.
He'll come with that girl.
By the way, we'll have to fix up his bedroom.
We'll get a double bed...
Well, we'll have grandchildren.
Oh, Renato, look at me.
I can just see you.
You, a grandfather... pushing the carriage...
with all your pendants.
-Shall I beat the eggs?
-No, please.
I'm the boss in the kitchen.
The kitchen's your kingdom?
Yes.
Yours is the stage, mine is here.
So be it.
I leave you to your concoctions.
Don't stop!
Mr. Charrier isn't here.
No, he won't be back!
It's been ringing all morning.
And your father's vanished.
I have something to tell you.
It's about Laurent's parents.
Don't worry.
We'll discuss it with your father.
That's just what I don't want.
You'll be surprised.
What are you doing there?
Didn't you see those vultures out there?
I had to use a ladder.
It's dangerous.
You could've fallen.
I did fall!
The hundredth!
You can imagine what my morning's been like.
I warn you. I'm leaving.
The reporters keep calling.
They chuckle.
I can't take anymore.
Not only the reporters.
Everyone is laughing...sneering.
Even on the street.
And who are they laughing at?
Who is the laughingstock?
Me!
Thanks to President Berthier, the moral order's become a joke!
Thanks, Mr. President, thanks a lot.
Dirty pig!
There is a solution, Simon.
An elegant white wedding.
And as soon as possible...
to regain your dignity.
Morality, background, tradition!
Your daughter marries a diplomat's son... president, whore, forgotten.
Marry off Andrea... with the Pope's blessing if we have to.
No, listen, Louise, I'm completely ruined.
If you keep on like this, I'll crack.
We have to marry her off...
in great splendor.
You'll be the symbol of order and tradition again.
Where do the young man's parents live?
I don't rehearse a million times.
I'm a professional.
Hire beginners... but don't let them bother the true artists.
Just watch Mr. Salome Von Liebig while I sing!
You're only demanding of me... making me rehearse at all hours.
All made up and in costume... while the others could be in underwear!
Come here. I want Mr. Baldi to show you the movements... to the Queen of Broadway.
You dance it like a horse.
Dad, I have to talk to you!
Being 20 and good-looking doesn't make you talented.
You understand, my dear?
Dad, it's important.
Hold on.
Albin's rehearsing.
Did you see what he did?
No, I was talking to Laurent.
He's blowing bubbles!
He's blowing bubbles while I sing.
I can't stand bubbles while I sing!
Young man, what's this about bubbles while madam sings?
She's right to be angry.
It may be a transvestite show, but you have to use your head.
Concentrate on your character... the psychological interpretation.
You're a handsome foreigner strolling down Broadway... with a manly gait.
Suddenly, you're in front of this beautiful woman.
You look at each other, fascinated.
You send forth a sexual call with the pelvis... like this...
Not bad for a psychological interpretation.
What is it?
I'll be right back.
Go on.
Can I talk to you?
What is it?
Let's go upstairs.
Andrea's parents are coming.
They're coming to meet you.
You interrupt me for that?
She told them you're a cultural attaché... and Albin, a housewife.
Then your fiancée is stupid.
Remember my first day of school?
I remember perfectly.
You told me to tell them you were a merchant.
So?
The girl's father... surely is more liberal than your teachers.
No, Dad, just the opposite.
Charrier, the Deputy...
Moral Order...
does that ring a bell?
So when asked, "What do his parents do?"
Andrea answered, "Cultural Attaché" and "Housewife."
So what should I do now?
Enroll in the Diplomatic Corps?
What about Albin?
Snip!
He has an operation!
If her father finds out she lied, it'll be tragic.
Try to help us, I beg you.
How?
First, send Albin away for a few days.
Albin?
You try and send Albin away.
And you could get rid of some things here.
For example?
That, for example.
Over here.
And this, for sure!
The discus thrower?
Why?
And that, too.
is that all?
I don't know, Dad.
I'd make everything more simple... more...stark.
That's what I mean.
In short, nothing's right here!
You want the dream house that appears in magazines.
We don't change anything here.
Understand?
And you should make a little effort, too.
An effort.
What for?
You could change a little... make yourself less conspicuous.
I'm conspicuous?
Laurent, it was just painted a month ago.
Albin and Salome are fighting over the chewing gum.
Yes, I use makeup, I live with a man, and I'm an old fag.
But I know who I am.
It's taken me 20 years, and that Deputy won't destroy it!
I don't give a damn about him !
Not a damn!
Going on a trip?
Saint-Tropez.
What are you doing?
I don't want to talk to them.
You'll go out the door and face them.
No, let go.
We need to give them the news.
You do it.
It's your idea.
Have the chauffeur come around.
Going somewhere?
Going to your President's funeral?
What's the future of the Moral Order?
A big smile.
I have only one thing to say.
I'm off to organize an event... which epitomizes the spirit of my party.
The little white master's in a bad mood.
He said I dress like a whore.
He's right.
Tonight you'll wear a butler's uniform... and a black tie.
Take this to the cellar.
And that, too.
And get rid of all these knickknacks... and these pillows.
Hide everything.
Especially this...
to the cellar.
No need to now.
Thanks, Dad.
Laurent, don't bug me.
I have to talk to poor Albin now.
What will I tell him?
"Get out, you're in the way.
Get out, fag."
You could find a nicer way.
Everything OK?
Just fine.
You shouldn't be out in the sun.
A suntan is becoming.
I know, but in your condition... the sun isn't good.
Why do you say that?
Did you look in the mirror today?
-What's the matter with me?
-You're green.
Suntanned.
Yes, suntan green.
I'm a little worried.
I think you really need a vacation.
But why should I take a vacation?
I feel great.
OK, forget I mentioned it.
Renato, are you saying this to scare me?
You know something.
The doctor told you something.
No.
The doctor didn't tell me a thing.
No, I'm the one who thinks that since you're so nervous... and rundown... a few days off wouldn't do you any harm.
Listen, Renato, when you begin to talk like this... it's because you want to tell me something.
Don't try to fool me.
I'm not 15 anymore.
I know certain tricks.
And this, Renato, isn't nice.
It's not worthy of you.
You know what day it is?
June the 25th.
As you say.
Our anniversary.
20 years of living together.
20 happy years.
And you choose today to lie to me... in the most despicable way.
And to try to deceive me.
Do you love Laurent?
Why do you ask me this?
If you love Laurent, you'll go.
The little white master called?
Cut it out and get rid of the discus thrower.
Hurry.
There's not much time.
I'm being exiled, rejected like a leper!
You're ashamed of me!
I've watched over that boy.
I've sacrificed myself for him.
I've been a mother to him for 20 years.
Albin, listen.
No!
You listen to me, Renato!
Either I stay here to receive the in-laws... or I'll never set foot in here again!
What's the matter?
Laurent, I told you to wait a while.
It's nothing.
I've understood.
I'm being excluded.
I'm being thrown out of my own house.
It doesn't matter.
I'm leaving.
I'll leave you.
The monster.
The monster is leaving.
Are you happy now?
Come in.
Come back in.
Come cry at home.
Albin, stop acting like a fool!
I don't want to see you anymore.
You've ruined everything.
OK, you win.
You can stay.
I can't take any more.
My heart, Renato.
I'm not that young.
All these emotions...
it's too much.
Feel my pulse.
Oh, God, I'm collapsing.
Come, we'll go to the bar.
It's the end.
The end.
You're weak.
You haven't eaten for hours.
No, no, he's just overtired.
Do you want to lie down?
That's OK.
The tea will do.
And some toast.
Well, what are we going to do about tonight?
Quite a problem.
Two men like us...
what can we tell them?
Thank you, Darling.
It feels so good.
Well, maybe I could be...
I don't know...a relative.
His uncle, perhaps?
You could say I'm his uncle.
All right, I can't be his uncle.
In any case, you don't resemble your character either.
Didn't Laurent say you were a cultural attaché?
Cultural attaché, like hell, Darling!
You don't know what culture is!
Here it is, tea and toast.
Feeling better?
I don't know.
Just look how the great diplomat eats!
You're like a steamroller.
Your pinky.
What's it doing up there?
Just look at it.
It does it by itself.
You'll say that for the deputy tonight, huh?
Well, let's try to make a man out of this uncle.
You have to learn how to hold things.
Hold the toast in a manly way, like this.
Spread the butter with force.
Drink the tea like a laborer drinks wine.
First, sit up like a man.
What do you want from me?
Please, don't whine every time I correct you.
I'm teaching you.
I want you to look like a man tonight.
Good, now butter your toast.
Butter it like a man.
Don't be afraid.
That's the way!
You're doing it on purpose!
Take another one.
I'll never get it.
Never.
Don't whine, please, don't whine!
Now hold this piece firmly in your hand.
Like a man.
With a strong hand, understand?
Like a real man!
Now something more difficult.
A little jam?
Yes, take the spoon.
The teaspoon?
Not like that!
It's not a paintbrush.
It's only a spoon.
Hold it firmly.
Boldly.
Understand?
You have something against me.
You want to kill me, old bitch!
I'll never get it.
I broke the toast again.
It's broken.
Too bad.
It's situations like this... that force you to act like a man.
Do you understand?
I understand.
You're right.
You have to say to yourself...
"Albin, so you made a mistake.
"lt isn't hopeless.
You can try again."
Force yourself.
Take another piece.
You're right.
In the end, it's not serious.
After all, I still have other ones.
Your pinky... lt does it by itself.
Blow your nose.
Let's go home.
Wait.
I need to freshen up.
What have I done now?
What kind of walk is that?
What's wrong with it?
Walk like that tonight and we're ruined.
How should I do it?
Come here.
What do you want?
Try to walk like John Wayne.
The cowboy?
John Wayne gets down from the horse.
He goes toward the saloon.
He opens the doors, and zap!
-Try it.
-l have to be John Wayne?
There I go.
That's John Wayne's daughter!
Look at that fag!
Someone just called me a fag.
Did you call my friend a fag?
It's going down.
You can hardly see it.
Relax, darling.
You were wonderful, marvelous.
I'm proud of you.
That human mountain looked ridiculous... when he sat on you and banged your head on the floor.
I pitied him.
A silly brute who didn't know how to hit you.
No, leave it.
I'll get some ice.
It'll do him good.
Be right back, darling!
I have bad news for you.
I couldn't do it.
I told him to stay tonight.
Why?
What do you mean?
Because he nearly died in my arms.
Because he's been my companion for years.
And because he has 80% interest in the club.
How are you going to introduce him?
As your uncle.
Then we're ruined.
Calm down.
How stubborn you are.
What a temper!
We can talk it over.
Certainly, it would be ideal if we had a woman here.
Strange, huh?
We actually need a woman here.
Why don't you call your mother?
-No, never!
-Why?
She abandoned me 20 years ago, and I won't ask her for a thing!
You're not helping matters much.
OK, I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it myself.
You can't be serious.
Go see that witch after what she did?
-Are you crazy?
-Why?
Mrs. Deblon, please.
Ask the secretary over there.
Come in.
I'd like to see Mrs. Deblon.
You have an appointment?
No, but tell her it's Renato Baldi.
I doubt she'll see you without an appointment.
She's very busy.
At least try.
Tell her Renato Baldi is here.
Wait in the hall.
Madam President will see you at once.
I'm coming with you.
I won't leave you alone with that woman.
I know what she's capable of.
Mrs. Deblon is waiting.
I'm coming.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Renato Baldi.
Dear Madam President.
I must say this is a surprise.
Have a seat.
I never drink in the morning, but...for the occasion...
What made you come see me?
Laurent.
It's not serious, is it?
He wants to get married.
Already?
How old is he?
You don't even remember.
You haven't seen that boy for nearly 20 years.
Yes, I know.
Did you come to reproach me?
My goodness, no.
It's just that for the first time, Laurent needs you.
I can cancel my appointments.
I'll be with you tonight.
-Thank you.
-lt's my pleasure.
I haven't done much for that kid in 20 years.
-At times, I feel guilty.
-What can I say?
I'm not very maternal.
I am.
It's true.
He's been very lucky.
Well, then...
what time tonight?
At 8:00.
We'll do our little play... they'll leave, and everything will be fine.
Do you remember the revue?
How could I forget?
How handsome you were!
I'd never seen such a body.
Now don't embarrass me.
Remember how afraid you were?
I almost had a heart attack.
I walk in my room and find a woman in my bed!
I got in by giving the doorman a tip.
$10 in those days!
I was completely drunk.
And when I saw you in bed nude, I said to myself...
"Let's try it."
You have to try everything in life, right?
So much had been said about it... that I gave in.
How long did the two of us last?
I can tell you exactly.
From 2:30 to 3:45.
Two times.
It's hot in here.
You haven't changed much.
A few more pounds... but it's becoming.
It makes you...
more manly.
What's all this hair?
You didn't have any when I met you.
I shaved it for the stage.
He shaved it so I never got to enjoy it.
Careful, Simone.
Careful.
It's a crepe shirt.
With those nails of yours, you'll...
look... you pulled a thread.
What does that red light mean?
That Madam President is not to be disturbed for any reason.
Albin!
Thank you.
Do you have my glasses?
Where are my glasses?
Here it is.
"The death of President Berthier."
There's nothing at all.
"Exemplary career..."
"Heart attack..."
Nothing here.
Excellent.
Nothing here.
It's better this way.
It helps to have friends who are newspaper editors.
I knew it!
I was sure!
Those bastards!
Two columns!
"The Happy Death of President Berthier."
Relax, Simon.
Listen to this.
"The last sentence uttered by Berthier...
"symbol of the Moral Order, was, 'Remember my little gift."'
What rats!
What rats!
May they die!
Forget this whole story, Simon!
Think of the goal of this trip.
The antique dealer rented it to me.
He wants it back tomorrow.
I redecorated the entire living room.
I hope your guests appreciate it.
What's going on?
Thanks, Jacob.
I would've liked to have known my grandchildren.
Don't go away!
Don't leave us!
Don't cry, Jacob.
What is this?
"Uncle Tom's Cabin?"
I know.
I know what you think.
People make fun of me.
Not just in the club... but in the street as well.
Everywhere.
I'm aware that I'm ridiculous.
And there's only one place where no one is ridiculous.
And I'm going there.
Good-bye, Renato.
Don't leave!
I'm leaving you my stereo, my red boots, and my wigs.
But where are you going?
To Foissy!
Foissy?
There's nothing but a cemetery in Foissy.
That's why I'm taking the minimum.
A toothbrush to the cemetery?
-lt's over, Jacob.
-l'm praying.
You know, my cemetery is in Lombardy.
It's the prettiest in the world.
There are trees.
The sky is blue.
There are birds.
Yours is for shit.
It's true. ln Foissy, they bury the dead in shit.
Forgive me for saying this, but you've become an old hag.
It's true, you're worthless, you're ridiculous.
You make people laugh.
But I'm with you.
Because you make me laugh.
So you know what I'm going to do?
Leave everything behind and go with you to the shit at Foissy.
To laugh.
Every time you're with her, the same thing happens.
In 20 years, it's just the second time!
Imagine having another child at your age.
You'd take care of the tiny tot by yourself, my dear.
I couldn't deal with a second motherhood.
What's so funny?
I'm really ready to strangle you.
I'd like to talk to you.
I know you're having problems.
I know the press is still interested in us, and so-- l wanted to tell you that... the people we're going to--
Wait!
This meat is not fresh.
I'll exchange it right away.
No, leave it. I don't want more of the same junk.
It's shocking that a place like this would serve rotten meat!
I'll take it back.
What else can I do?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Write to Michelin.
You'll have fewer stars in the next guidebook.
That's it.
Well done, Simon.
Now what about all the people we're going to see?
Nothing.
It's nothing important.
Good, Jacob...very good.
A perfect butler.
Haven't you forgotten something?
I can't wear shoes. I never wear them.
They make me fall!
Go on.
Go put your shoes on.
And use your normal voice.
It's better.
The little white master wanted the voice of a real black male.
Perfect, Dad.
You think so?
This suit reminds me of my grandfather.
He always dressed like this.
He killed himself when he was 30.
Remember, Dad.
As few gestures as possible.
And don't walk around, and don't talk too much.
Just what's necessary.
The minimum.
What's wrong?
I'm dressed appropriately, aren't I?
Nothing on my fingers.
Nothing on my eyes or lips.
And on your feet?
I thought a little hint of color wouldn't be out of place.
Yes, you're right.
Dressed like this I am even more ridiculous.
And I know you're thinking that, too.
Well... I'll leave.
I'll go.
I wanted so much to help you, my little one.
It'll pass.
Who is it?
My mother.
Mr. Baldi's not here.
Who's speaking?
is it you, Laurent?
Laurent, I can imagine what you think of me.
After your father's visit, I asked myself a lot of questions.
You may think it's a little late, but...
Listen, Laurent, your father's right.
It'll be better with a woman there.
Since I'm already on the road... if you still want me...
I'll come.
Come.
Come?
!
Have you gone crazy, Laurent?
It'll be better if she's here.
Do you know what he will do if your mother sets foot in here?
He said he wanted to help me.
He'll be good.
Come on, relax.
Everything will be fine.
Touch this.
Squeeze it hard.
We rented you for only one day, but if all goes well... I'm willing to buy you... and get rid of my charm.
In fact, I'll do it right now.
You have your shoes on?
Go on.
I'm honored.
Please, come in.
My father.
My daughter.
Nice to meet you.
My husband.
It's a great honor.
My mother apologizes.
She'll be late.
She had to take my brothers and sisters to my grandparents'.
Andrea told us that you have a large family, Mr. Baldi.
Quite large.
How many brothers and sisters does Laurent have?
-Six.
-Six.
People don't have children anymore.
Our movement is very worried about this drop in births.
I congratulate you.
Your family should be held up as an example.
Have a seat, please.
One, two, three.
This is Charrier's chauffeur.
Just a second.
Charrier's chauffeur.
The Charriers are at "La Cage aux Folles."
Are you sure?
I'm sure. I just left them at the owner's place.
Call Moreau in Toulon fast!
Charrier with fags!
What a story!
Did you have a good trip?
Great.
Beautiful weather, good roads.
We spent the night... near Lyon, at my friend Bouchard's.
He's someone I met in the service.
I met him again a few years later in the hotel business.
He had inherited... a large property from his father and turned it into a modern hotel.
Comfortable.
Yes, comfortable.
Very nice.
Quite good.
Quite good.
It was a pleasant...stay.
I like the severity of this room.
Well, for my father...
this house... is a place more for work and concentration... than a vacation house.
A monastery.
I captured the atmosphere right away.
I can always tell right away who I'm dealing with.
I'm pleased to say...
I feel good with a man like you.
You've seduced my husband, Mr. Baldi.
I rarely hear him give so many compliments.
In fact, I must admit... that though I'm a civil servant--
Champagne, or do you prefer something else?
No, thank you.
Just some water, please.
I never drink either, but today, I'll make an exception.
Watch what you're doing, idiot!
Nothing serious.
Champagne brings luck.
Go on, Jacob.
We'll handle it.
Can I help you?
Jacob's a good fellow, but he still has a lot to learn.
Help is really a problem these days.
If I told you how many chauffeurs I've had this year...
You must have even more trouble since you travel so much.
Here I am.
I'm here!
Here's Mother!
Please forgive me. I'm terribly sorry, but the traffic--
Every day it gets worse.
It's becoming impossible.
Mr. Charrier, thrilled to meet you!
I've been dying to meet the father of that naughty girl... who's stealing my baby.
The naughty thing!
Dear Madam, I'm just joking.
I already like the child.
What a sweet thing!
How about a kiss?
How about a kiss for your second mother?
Come here, darling.
I already love her.
She's adorable.
She's frightened, poor dear.
Come here.
Don't be afraid.
She's adorable.
Give me a cigarette.
Go warn your mother not to come.
Thanks.
Excuse me for a moment.
Where's the boy going?
Dinner is served.
-Jacob, what's come over you?
-Nothing.
Nothing at all.
-Servants are such a problem.
-We were just saying that.
It's close to impossible to get good help these days.
You can't imagine how many maids have passed through here.
And one's as clumsy as the next.
Not mean, just inept.
I could name a dozen-- Roger, Marcel, Luciano...
Dinner.
No need to be so nasty.
Magnificent.
That Christ is splendid.
-Yes.
My father.
-Pardon me?
My father, he restored it.
My father loved antiques.
Mr. Charrier on my right.
Renato on my left.
Mrs. Charrier there, and the girl across from mama.
Please, sit down.
These plates are very unusual.
They're pictures of young men playing together.
We have so many plates, I can't really say which ones those are.
From the 16th century.
I think they are Greek figures.
Greeks on my plates?
How did they get there?
Would you like to see it?
I can't see without my glasses.
They're two young men, aren't they?
Two young men.
Young men?
But there must be some girls, too.
Yes, I think I saw one.
What a cute child.
She's right, of course.
There, there's one.
There's a girl there.
Isn't that a girl?
Then I haven't seen one in a long time.
My goodness!
It's two boys, for sure.
They're naked.
Where are my glasses?
I'll be back in a minute.
Idiot!
He uses the dishes with the naked Greeks!
I can never find my glasses.
Let's see.
Peasant soup Martinique style.
Jacob's specialty!
Oh, I'm sorry, Madam.
Jacob, take over.
Poor Mrs. Charrier is holding our Lord in her arms.
My apologies.
I am really sorry.
This way, please.
Bon appetit.
There are only two entrances, here and at the club.
Morin and Chauvet, wait at the club.
Will you stay on the Coast for long?
No. I don't like to be away from my constituency for too long.
-From your...?
-From my work.
And also the ambiance of this area, the dissipation... the loose morals... make me sick.
Doesn't that nightclub downstairs bother you?
A nightclub?
Yes.
And quite an ill-reputed one.
It's called "La Cage aux Folles."
Oh, yes, "La Cage aux Folles."
You're right above it!
You share walls with those people!
Just the walls.
Just the walls.
We're not friendly with them.
That's another world.
But...who owns the building?
We do!
You rent your cellar to the owner of a nightclub?
Yes, Yes!
But we didn't know he was a... nightclub owner!
Naturally...we didn't know it.
He's a man... who doesn't say much.
He's so reserved.
It's just, "Hello, good-bye."
He's not one to say, "Hey, I'm going...
I'm going to put...
"a nightclub in your cellar."
Excuse me.
We should talk about the wedding.
Laurent is not here, but...
These are things that parents should discuss.
Though our kids have already decided.
What do you think of the kids' decision?
I must say that at first I was a little against it.
But when my daughter spoke so highly of your family... of its respectability...
When your daughter told you...
about our family?
Yes, it...reassured me.
I thought that Andrea was... too young to get married, and your son, as well.
But since they're in love...
and won't listen to reason... since they chose each other--
Since they chose each other?
Well, I must admit that at first, we, too... were somewhat opposed to this marriage.
Especially me!
It's always hard on a mother... when her son leaves her for another woman.
You'll say that's life.
Sure, that's life.
At some point, children leave.
It's a law, but...
Excuse us.
Come, honey.
But we're discussing important things.
Excuse me.
What's so urgent?
What's the matter with you?
Look at yourself in the mirror!
All right, so it moved a little.
-What were you thinking of?
-They believe it.
All three were lovely to me.
I made a big impression.
Big impression?
If they find out, everything's ruined.
I'm not doing it for you, but for Laurent.
And it's working fine.
On stage, perhaps.
Makeup and cream aren't enough here.
The Deputy surely noticed your hairy hands!
A hostess doesn't leave her guests. lt isn't polite.
Albin, stay here!
My wig!
Renato, give me back my wig!
Give me back my wig!
They're not expecting this.
It'll be a big surprise!
Mr. Baldi is upstairs.
I'm Laurent's mother.
Follow me, Madam.
Happy anniversary to you...
How rude!
Leaving us alone like this!
And the son disappearing before dinner.
Maybe he had an errand to run.
And that woman is strange.
She has a way of speaking--
When she comes out with that "uh-uh-uh," l sense something.
I think she's nice.
Did someone knock?
Well, where's that butler?
Who's there?
It's Laurent's mother, Mr. Baldi.
Laurent's mother?
It's me, Renato.
Open up.
Her voice has changed.
Who's there?
Laurent's mother.
Mr. Baldi isn't here.
I haven't the key.
The key's in the nook by the door.
In the nook.
What nook?
On the left!
Mr. Charrier, I'm Simone Baldi.
Nice to meet you.
You have an adorable daughter, Madam.
My compliments.
She's gorgeous!
I knew my son had taste, but...
Your son, Mr. Baldi... how many mothers has he got?
Would you repeat the question, please?
I'm asking you how many mothers your son has got.
Just one.
Albin.
"La Cage aux Folles..."
Dad...
let me explain.
What kind of story did you tell me?
!
Cultural attaché?
!
Housewife!
Stop it!
I was afraid to tell you. I've been afraid of you for 18 years.
Simon!
Let's go.
Right away.
Come on.
Let's get going!
No, I'm staying.
Then stay!
I no longer have a daughter!
I no longer have a daughter.
Reporters!
Reporters.
That's the last straw.
A nice white wedding, huh?
In great splendor!
With the Pope's blessing!
What good is that photo?
It's shit!
What can you see?
A door with Charrier behind it?
What good is that?
I can see the headlines in tomorrow's papers.
"Sequel to President Berthier and His Whore."
"Deputy Charrier Frolics With Transvestites."
Mr. Deputy, take a look at this door.
There's no neon sign.
You can leave.
The bastards.
They've blocked the door.
This way they are forcing you to leave through the nightclub.
Through the nightclub?
They'll be waiting there.
Through the nightclub...
with the transvestites...
No.
We'll call the police.
A ladder.
Do you have a ladder?
Not again, Simon.
I'm ruined...
I'm ruined!
Renato, the poor man is really in a bind.
And his wife, too.
She's in the shit with him.
They're pitiful.
Well, I'll have to save the day...as usual.
You want to get out of here, right?
No scandal, no publicity.
It's the first time, but you'll get used to it.
Then you can do it yourself.
You're gorgeous.
You look awful.
White makes me look fat.
I wanted black!
What are you saying?
He's a great girl!
Hurry, and wiggle a little.
Mercedes, dance with her and move her towards the exit.
Would you like to dance?
Get going, you gutsy thing.
To the hotel!
Hurry!
To the hotel!
-How much?
-How much?
It's me, your boss!
-Calm down, Madam.
-Madam?
!
Don't you recognize me?
The idiot called me a whore!
See that?
She came.
I knew she would.
I told you I didn't want her here.
She's my son's mother.
It's normal for her to be here.
No, it's not normal!
The model mother...
now, after so many years.
Listen, if that witch goes to the reception, I won't.
-Please, Albin.
-l won't go!
That's the only way.
That's really easy.
-Please.
-Please like hell!
I'm fed up.
And you tell Laurent.
He'll understand because he loves me.
He'll understand that the day of his wedding I had to leave--
5,500 tonight.
What the hell is she doing?
I'll get her.
Go away!
She goes on in a few moments.
Mercedes just began.
You handle it.
I can't take any more.
I'm ready to kill her tonight.
A full house tonight, Mr. Baldi.
How much have we got?
1,250 more than yesterday.
Shall we do something about the prince's tab?
-No discounts.
How big is it?
-About 625.
-How many are they?
-Two.
Don't charge for the coffee.
Mr. Baldi, I couldn't do a thing.
-Insist!
-It's no use.
OK, have Mercedes stay on longer.
Oh, Mr. Baldi, I'll get my bag.
I'm sorry to bother you, but she refuses to get up.
Were you having dinner?
She must be onstage in 10 minutes... and she hasn't made up.
Go away!
It's me, Zaza.
The doctor.
I'm not here.
Show yourself, Zaza.
Be a good girl and uncover yourself so I can see you.
But I'm a monster.
I'm horrible, Doctor!
Zaza, your fans are waiting, and my dinner is getting cold.
Stop acting like such a prima donna!
Doctor, I'm so unhappy, so unhappy.
If you only knew!
You're a little depressed.
It'll pass.
I want to die, Doctor.
I want to die!
Were you having dinner?
Can it be reheated?
Rabbit cacciatore.
That reheats well.
Here's what you do.
Put it in a double boiler.
But, attention, it has to be a double boiler.
I always tell my friends, the secret is the double boiler.
Are you dying or cooking?
Look who's talking!
It's your fault I'm like this.
Look what I have become.
A human larva.
A dried up fig!
A dried up fig.
Before meeting you, I had a firm, soft skin.
Look what a horror I am now.
Every night the same thing.
I taped it yesterday.
I suffer, and he plays.
Shall I play it back?
I'll give him a shot.
No, Doctor!
No shots!
Ask his understudy to replace him.
I'll behave.
Well...
Then, are we going to work?
Any tranquilizers left?
There are a few left in the box.
I'm sure.
As usual, two pills after the show.
-I'm leaving.
-Good-bye, Doctor.
The season's just begun.
If he gets sick, do I close the club?
It's nothing serious.
He's just overtired.
Be kind to him, and everything will be fine.
-Good night, Mr. Baldi.
-Good night, and thanks again.
Do you know what time it is?
You want to ruin the business?
You're doing it on purpose.
Why do you put makeup on your legs?
Nobody sees your legs on stage.
Indifference is the most awful thing, Renato.
I've been dieting for two months and you haven't even noticed... that I've lost weight.
I've ruined my health for you... with those diet pills and diuretics.
And nothing from you...
not a word.
No support.
You don't notice me anymore.
You don't love me anymore.
Just the other day...
I bought a delightful outfit.
I put it on.
Just to please you.
Nothing.
I'll wind up in a nut house if you continue.
Everything's possible.
You don't love me anymore.
After so many years, you think of me as a bowl of minestrone... not as the queen of the stage.
You're being unfaithful.
Here we go again!
There's a man in your life.
There aren't any men.
Just 250 people waiting for the leading lady... to make up her mind.
They pay a lot to see you...
to applaud you... to applaud the great Zaza Napoli!
And what do you do while I'm onstage?
Where do you go while I'm killing myself onstage?
Go ahead.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Well, how is it?
It'll be fine.
Don't worry, darling.
You can't even see it.
Did you hurt yourself with your fists?
Darling, then you still love me?
Of course.
Hurry up.
What's wrong?
-My fan.
-Jacob will bring it to you.
-I can't sing without my fan!
-Jacob, get Zaza's fan!
My fan!
Good evening, sweetheart.
Bravo, Mercedes.
You've already sung too much.
Go, go.
Go on.
Don't just stand here.
Announce Albin.
Enough of those chocolates.
Enough!
Renato, I've had enough of your beautiful lady!
Don't shout when a colleague is working.
-I could have finished myself.
-Go to hell!
What am I being paid for?
-To sing 4 songs or 8?
-To sing 16!
I can't depend on Madam's moods.
She only cares about being in bed with you.
How dare you!
As of tomorrow, you dress like a man!
-Not like a man!
Forgive me!
-What is said is said.
Henry.
-So where's that stupid fan?
-Coming.
Jacob!
I told you not to prance about the house naked.
You don't like it?
Why don't you let me dance?
Look at me.
What do the others have that I don't?
You have something more, even if it's of no use to you.
Go get dressed.
And take the evening off.
That way, I won't have you underfoot.
I don't believe this.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
It's late, Petunia, and I have an appointment.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
-What have you done this time?
-I'm expecting a baby.
I'm expecting a baby.
You got your wife pregnant?
But it's the seventh one.
How do you expect to have a career?
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Procreation is wearing you out.
You're looking older day by day.
It's true.
OK, I'll have the administration... compensate you for this misfortune.
That's fine.
Go back to work.
I'll be forever grateful.
And give up this fixation.
Take that off your head, or I'll tell Albin you wear his wigs.
And I'll tell him you have romantic dinners while he works.
Get out of here, you idiot!
More handsome than ever.
How about a drink?
Is Zaza onstage?
For two more hours.
So we won't be disturbed.
I gave Jacob the night off.
We're all alone.
You look good.
I'm all bloated.
Work.
I work too much, I get upset, and I bloat.
-You think I look good?
-Dazzling!
You're really sweet.
Yes, my body is still good, actually.
I have something to tell you.
This isn't easy.
I'm getting married.
I was going to write you, but a letter...
She's a great girl.
You'll see.
You upset?
On the contrary, I should be happy.
I always hoped you'd fall in love with a girl... so I should be happy.
No, everything's fine.
I raise a boy for 20 years...my son.
Then a girl comes and steals him.
A whore.
A whore.
Yes, a whore.
Listen carefully.
If you marry her, never set foot in here again.
I won't give you another cent.
Choose.
Good-bye, Dad.
You little idiot, come here.
Let's have a toast for this catastrophe.
Did you think I'd fall for that?
No, but it was worth a try.
Come on.
Let's toast.
You always toast a wedding.
To the bride and groom !
-What's the whore's name?
-Please, Dad.
Sorry.
What's the girl's name?
So, you've been seeing a boy in Paris for a year... and we only find out now.
Answer.
Answer me!
You're scaring her, Simon.
She'll never talk if you go on that way.
He's a nice boy, Father.
And very serious.
He was the one to mention marriage.
What do his parents do?
Hold on.
It's for you.
I spoke to him.
And you?
I spoke to mine, too.
He's happy.
Whore!
He opened champagne to celebrate the news.
I've got the glass in my hand.
To our love, Andrea.
I'll put him on.
No.
Hello?
To your happiness, Andrea.
Shit!
No, not you.
I just broke the glass.
My best wishes for your happiness.
Here.
Whore.
Your father's nice.
Listen, I'm with my parents.
Can I call you tomorrow morning?
No, no, don't worry.
I do, too.
Until tomorrow.
Everything went fine...
thank goodness.
Did you hear how clear their voices were?
Like they were next door.
It was really clear.
Well, I...
It's late.
I'm going to bed.
Andrea, we asked you what the young man's parents do.
His parents?
Nothing.
Well, they're vacationing on the Cote d'Azur.
Yes...but they're not on vacation all the time.
So what does his father do?
His father...
He's in the arts, I think.
Cultural affairs, in fact.
He's a Cultural Attaché.
That's it...
at the Italian Embassy.
Oh, good.
He's a diplomat.
Diplomats.
Important people!
Why didn't you tell us right away?
Does his mother work?
No, his mother takes care of the children.
She has lots of them.
Good morning.
The little one's arrived.
-How about a nice roast?
-Fine.
I'll pick it up later.
I want some pasta and some Parmesan.
-The boy's home?
-Yes, and I've got to hurry.
Good morning.
The usual?
Yes, a cake with the inscription...
"To my Lolo, from Auntie."
I've got to run.
He'll be waking up any minute.
Shall I deliver the cake?
No.
Jacob'll pick it up.
I'm taking a chocolate.
Jacob!
Who did I see?
Who did I see there?
Who arrived?
The little white man.
This coffee really stinks.
You French make shitty coffee.
I've been called black, I've been called queer... but French, never!
My darlings...
I'm here!
The grocery lady's here.
-Had a good time last night?
-He took me dancing.
Put everything away.
Watch the eggs.
And don't forget to pick up the cake at noon.
Oh, God, your beard's rough.
Is he asleep?
I peeked in on him before.
He's gorgeous.
Why didn't you tell me that Laurent was coming?
I wouldn't have made a scene.
The truth is that you hide him from me.
You can't stand sharing him.
You want him all to yourself, so you try to get rid of me.
Oh, I'm so hungry!
You look awful.
What's wrong?
He's getting married.
What?
My son's getting married.
Don't be stupid.
I bought sole.
He loves sole.
I do, too.
I wanted lobster, but it was too expensive... so I bought sole.
You know, it's funny.
A few days ago, I dreamed he was getting married.
We were at the church and we were both crying.
You weren't serious?
Some girl he's known for a year.
They went to the same school.
A girl.
Oh, how horrible.
Poor guy.
She caught him because he's... he's so young, so inexperienced.
He'll ruin his life.
I told him.
And how I told him !
He won't listen.
He says he'll be happy.
I hope he will be.
There's nothing I can do.
You know, it hurts at first.
Such an unexpected blow.
You feel as if you can't breathe.
Maybe it's my liver.
It'll go away.
What a bitch, that whore!
I see he knows.
Here's the little jerk.
Well, how about a kiss for your Auntie?
He's being taken from us, and we won't have any others.
Unless there's a miracle.
I've thought a lot about this marriage.
In the president's speech... replace the word "rascal" with "scoundrel."
I can see Mrs. Simoneau's face if we marry a diplomat's son.
No, correction.
Listen carefully.
Instead of "scoundrel"... put "degenerate."
What with your background, Simon, this is quite a marriage.
You, a policeman's son.
Enough!
Don't start with that again, Louise!
I'm tired of it!
Policeman here, policeman there!
I'm fed up with it!
I almost ate it!
No, Andrea is too young.
The subject is closed.
Hello?
Speaking.
Oh, my God.
My god.
What's wrong, Simon?
President Berthier is dead.
In a woman's arms.
A prostitute.
A minor, no less.
A minor...and black!
A prostitute, a minor and colored.
My career is ruined.
Don't say that, Simon.
You're not responsible.
Listen to me.
You're not responsible for the president's private life!
I'm the Secretary General of a party called...
"The Union for Moral Order."
Our president just died in the arms of a prostitute.
Great meat for the press.
I could use a little piece of chocolate.
Oh, no!
He forgot part of the inscription!
Aunt is not Auntie!
"To my Lolo from Auntie!"
I ordered the usual.
"Auntie," not "Aunt."
What a disaster!
Smells good.
Feeling better?
He'll come visit.
He'll come with that girl.
By the way, we'll have to fix up his bedroom.
We'll get a double bed...
Well, we'll have grandchildren.
Oh, Renato, look at me.
I can just see you.
You, a grandfather... pushing the carriage...
with all your pendants.
-Shall I beat the eggs?
-No, please.
I'm the boss in the kitchen.
The kitchen's your kingdom?
Yes.
Yours is the stage, mine is here.
So be it.
I leave you to your concoctions.
Don't stop!
Mr. Charrier isn't here.
No, he won't be back!
It's been ringing all morning.
And your father's vanished.
I have something to tell you.
It's about Laurent's parents.
Don't worry.
We'll discuss it with your father.
That's just what I don't want.
You'll be surprised.
What are you doing there?
Didn't you see those vultures out there?
I had to use a ladder.
It's dangerous.
You could've fallen.
I did fall!
The hundredth!
You can imagine what my morning's been like.
I warn you.
I'm leaving.
The reporters keep calling.
They chuckle.
I can't take anymore.
Not only the reporters.
Everyone is laughing...sneering.
Even on the street.
And who are they laughing at?
Who is the laughingstock?
Me!
Thanks to President Berthier, the moral order's become a joke!
Thanks, Mr. President, thanks a lot.
Dirty pig!
There is a solution, Simon.
An elegant white wedding.
And as soon as possible...
to regain your dignity.
Morality, background, tradition!
Your daughter marries a diplomat's son... president, whore, forgotten.
Marry off Andrea... with the Pope's blessing if we have to.
No, listen, Louise, I'm completely ruined.
If you keep on like this, I'll crack.
We have to marry her off...
in great splendor.
You'll be the symbol of order and tradition again.
Where do the young man's parents live?
I don't rehearse a million times.
I'm a professional.
Hire beginners... but don't let them bother the true artists.
Just watch Mr. Salome Von Liebig while I sing!
You're only demanding of me... making me rehearse at all hours.
All made up and in costume... while the others could be in underwear!
Come here.
I want Mr. Baldi to show you the movements... to the Queen of Broadway.
You dance it like a horse.
Dad, I have to talk to you!
Being 20 and good-looking doesn't make you talented.
You understand, my dear?
Dad, it's important.
Hold on.
Albin's rehearsing.
Did you see what he did?
No, I was talking to Laurent.
He's blowing bubbles!
He's blowing bubbles while I sing.
I can't stand bubbles while I sing!
Young man, what's this about bubbles while madam sings?
She's right to be angry.
It may be a transvestite show, but you have to use your head.
Concentrate on your character... the psychological interpretation.
You're a handsome foreigner strolling down Broadway... with a manly gait.
Suddenly, you're in front of this beautiful woman.
You look at each other, fascinated.
You send forth a sexual call with the pelvis... like this...
Not bad for a psychological interpretation.
What is it?
I'll be right back.
Go on.
Can I talk to you?
What is it?
Let's go upstairs.
Andrea's parents are coming.
They're coming to meet you.
You interrupt me for that?
She told them you're a cultural attaché... and Albin, a housewife.
Then your fiancée is stupid.
Remember my first day of school?
I remember perfectly.
You told me to tell them you were a merchant.
So?
The girl's father... surely is more liberal than your teachers.
No, Dad, just the opposite.
Charrier, the Deputy...
Moral Order...
does that ring a bell?
So when asked, "What do his parents do?"
Andrea answered, "Cultural Attaché" and "Housewife."
So what should I do now?
Enroll in the Diplomatic Corps?
What about Albin?
Snip!
He has an operation!
If her father finds out she lied, it'll be tragic.
Try to help us, I beg you.
How?
First, send Albin away for a few days.
Albin?
You try and send Albin away.
And you could get rid of some things here.
For example?
That, for example.
Over here.
And this, for sure!
The discus thrower?
Why?
And that, too.
Is that all?
I don't know, Dad.
I'd make everything more simple... more...stark.
That's what I mean.
In short, nothing's right here!
You want the dream house that appears in magazines.
We don't change anything here.
Understand?
And you should make a little effort, too.
An effort.
What for?
You could change a little... make yourself less conspicuous.
I'm conspicuous?
Laurent, it was just painted a month ago.
Albin and Salome are fighting over the chewing gum.
Yes, I use makeup, I live with a man, and I'm an old fag.
But I know who I am.
It's taken me 20 years, and that Deputy won't destroy it!
I don't give a damn about him !
Not a damn!
Going on a trip?
Saint-Tropez.
What are you doing?
I don't want to talk to them.
You'll go out the door and face them.
No, let go.
We need to give them the news.
You do it.
It's your idea.
Have the chauffeur come around.
Going somewhere?
Going to your President's funeral?
What's the future of the Moral Order?
A big smile.
I have only one thing to say.
I'm off to organize an event... which epitomizes the spirit of my party.
The little white master's in a bad mood.
He said I dress like a whore.
He's right.
Tonight you'll wear a butler's uniform... and a black tie.
Take this to the cellar.
And that, too.
And get rid of all these knickknacks... and these pillows.
Hide everything.
Especially this...
to the cellar.
No need to now.
Thanks, Dad.
Laurent, don't bug me.
I have to talk to poor Albin now.
What will I tell him?
"Get out, you're in the way.
Get out, fag."
You could find a nicer way.
Everything OK?
Just fine.
You shouldn't be out in the sun.
A suntan is becoming.
I know, but in your condition... the sun isn't good.
Why do you say that?
Did you look in the mirror today?
-What's the matter with me?
-You're green.
Suntanned.
Yes, suntan green.
I'm a little worried.
I think you really need a vacation.
But why should I take a vacation?
I feel great.
OK, forget I mentioned it.
Renato, are you saying this to scare me?
You know something.
The doctor told you something.
No.
The doctor didn't tell me a thing.
No, I'm the one who thinks that since you're so nervous... and rundown... a few days off wouldn't do you any harm.
Listen, Renato, when you begin to talk like this... it's because you want to tell me something.
Don't try to fool me.
I'm not 15 anymore.
I know certain tricks.
And this, Renato, isn't nice.
It's not worthy of you.
You know what day it is?
June the 25th.
As you say.
Our anniversary.
20 years of living together.
20 happy years.
And you choose today to lie to me... in the most despicable way.
And to try to deceive me.
Do you love Laurent?
Why do you ask me this?
If you love Laurent, you'll go.
The little white master called?
Cut it out and get rid of the discus thrower.
Hurry.
There's not much time.
I'm being exiled, rejected like a leper!
You're ashamed of me!
I've watched over that boy.
I've sacrificed myself for him.
I've been a mother to him for 20 years.
Albin, listen.
No!
You listen to me, Renato!
Either I stay here to receive the in-laws... or I'll never set foot in here again!
What's the matter?
Laurent, I told you to wait a while.
It's nothing.
I've understood.
I'm being excluded.
I'm being thrown out of my own house.
It doesn't matter.
I'm leaving.
I'll leave you.
The monster.
The monster is leaving.
Are you happy now?
Come in.
Come back in.
Come cry at home.
Albin, stop acting like a fool!
I don't want to see you anymore.
You've ruined everything.
OK, you win.
You can stay.
I can't take any more.
My heart, Renato.
I'm not that young.
All these emotions...
it's too much.
Feel my pulse.
Oh, God, I'm collapsing.
Come, we'll go to the bar.
It's the end.
The end.
You're weak.
You haven't eaten for hours.
No, no, he's just overtired.
Do you want to lie down?
That's OK.
The tea will do.
And some toast.
Well, what are we going to do about tonight?
Quite a problem.
Two men like us...
what can we tell them?
Thank you, Darling.
It feels so good.
Well, maybe I could be...
I don't know...a relative.
His uncle, perhaps?
You could say I'm his uncle.
All right, I can't be his uncle.
In any case, you don't resemble your character either.
Didn't Laurent say you were a cultural attaché?
Cultural attaché, like hell, Darling!
You don't know what culture is!
Here it is, tea and toast.
Feeling better?
I don't know.
Just look how the great diplomat eats!
You're like a steamroller.
Your pinky.
What's it doing up there?
Just look at it.
It does it by itself.
You'll say that for the deputy tonight, huh?
Well, let's try to make a man out of this uncle.
You have to learn how to hold things.
Hold the toast in a manly way, like this.
Spread the butter with force.
Drink the tea like a laborer drinks wine.
First, sit up like a man.
What do you want from me?
Please, don't whine every time I correct you.
I'm teaching you.
I want you to look like a man tonight.
Good, now butter your toast.
Butter it like a man.
Don't be afraid.
That's the way!
You're doing it on purpose!
Take another one.
I'll never get it.
Never.
Don't whine, please, don't whine!
Now hold this piece firmly in your hand.
Like a man.
With a strong hand, understand?
Like a real man!
Now something more difficult.
A little jam?
Yes, take the spoon.
The teaspoon?
Not like that!
It's not a paintbrush.
It's only a spoon.
Hold it firmly.
Boldly.
Understand?
You have something against me.
You want to kill me, old bitch!
I'll never get it.
I broke the toast again.
It's broken.
Too bad.
It's situations like this... that force you to act like a man.
Do you understand?
I understand.
You're right.
You have to say to yourself...
"Albin, so you made a mistake.
"It isn't hopeless.
You can try again."
Force yourself.
Take another piece.
You're right.
In the end, it's not serious.
After all, I still have other ones.
Your pinky...
It does it by itself.
Blow your nose.
Let's go home.
Wait.
I need to freshen up.
What have I done now?
What kind of walk is that?
What's wrong with it?
Walk like that tonight and we're ruined.
How should I do it?
Come here.
What do you want?
Try to walk like John Wayne.
The cowboy?
John Wayne gets down from the horse.
He goes toward the saloon.
He opens the doors, and zap!
-Try it.
-I have to be John Wayne?
There I go.
That's John Wayne's daughter!
Look at that fag!
Someone just called me a fag.
Did you call my friend a fag?
It's going down.
You can hardly see it.
Relax, darling.
You were wonderful, marvelous.
I'm proud of you.
That human mountain looked ridiculous... when he sat on you and banged your head on the floor.
I pitied him.
A silly brute who didn't know how to hit you.
No, leave it.
I'll get some ice.
It'll do him good.
Be right back, darling!
I have bad news for you.
I couldn't do it.
I told him to stay tonight.
Why?
What do you mean?
Because he nearly died in my arms.
Because he's been my companion for years.
And because he has 80% interest in the club.
How are you going to introduce him?
As your uncle.
Then we're ruined.
Calm down.
How stubborn you are.
What a temper!
We can talk it over.
Certainly, it would be ideal if we had a woman here.
Strange, huh?
We actually need a woman here.
Why don't you call your mother?
-No, never!
-Why?
She abandoned me 20 years ago, and I won't ask her for a thing!
You're not helping matters much.
OK, I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it myself.
You can't be serious.
Go see that witch after what she did?
-Are you crazy?
-Why?
Mrs. Deblon, please.
Ask the secretary over there.
Come in.
I'd like to see Mrs. Deblon.
You have an appointment?
No, but tell her it's Renato Baldi.
I doubt she'll see you without an appointment.
She's very busy.
At least try.
Tell her Renato Baldi is here.
Wait in the hall.
Madam President will see you at once.
I'm coming with you.
I won't leave you alone with that woman.
I know what she's capable of.
Mrs. Deblon is waiting.
I'm coming.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Renato Baldi.
Dear Madam President.
I must say this is a surprise.
Have a seat.
I never drink in the morning, but...for the occasion...
What made you come see me?
Laurent.
It's not serious, is it?
He wants to get married.
Already?
How old is he?
You don't even remember.
You haven't seen that boy for nearly 20 years.
Yes, I know.
Did you come to reproach me?
My goodness, no.
It's just that for the first time, Laurent needs you.
I can cancel my appointments.
I'll be with you tonight.
-Thank you.
-It's my pleasure.
I haven't done much for that kid in 20 years.
-At times, I feel guilty.
-What can I say?
I'm not very maternal.
I am.
It's true.
He's been very lucky.
Well, then...
what time tonight?
At 8:00.
We'll do our little play... they'll leave, and everything will be fine.
Do you remember the revue?
How could I forget?
How handsome you were!
I'd never seen such a body.
Now don't embarrass me.
Remember how afraid you were?
I almost had a heart attack.
I walk in my room and find a woman in my bed!
I got in by giving the doorman a tip.
$10 in those days!
I was completely drunk.
And when I saw you in bed nude, I said to myself...
"Let's try it."
You have to try everything in life, right?
So much had been said about it... that I gave in.
How long did the two of us last?
I can tell you exactly.
From 2:30 to 3:45.
Two times.
It's hot in here.
You haven't changed much.
A few more pounds... but it's becoming.
It makes you...
more manly.
What's all this hair?
You didn't have any when I met you.
I shaved it for the stage.
He shaved it so I never got to enjoy it.
Careful, Simone.
Careful.
It's a crepe shirt.
With those nails of yours, you'll...
look... you pulled a thread.
What does that red light mean?
That Madam President is not to be disturbed for any reason.
Albin!
Thank you.
Do you have my glasses?
Where are my glasses?
Here it is.
"The death of President Berthier."
There's nothing at all.
"Exemplary career..."
"Heart attack..."
Nothing here.
Excellent.
Nothing here.
It's better this way.
It helps to have friends who are newspaper editors.
I knew it!
I was sure!
Those bastards!
Two columns!
"The Happy Death of President Berthier."
Relax, Simon.
Listen to this.
"The last sentence uttered by Berthier...
"symbol of the Moral Order, was, 'Remember my little gift."'
What rats!
What rats!
May they die!
Forget this whole story, Simon!
Think of the goal of this trip.
The antique dealer rented it to me.
He wants it back tomorrow.
I redecorated the entire living room.
I hope your guests appreciate it.
What's going on?
Thanks, Jacob.
I would've liked to have known my grandchildren.
Don't go away!
Don't leave us!
Don't cry, Jacob.
What is this?
"Uncle Tom's Cabin?"
I know.
I know what you think.
People make fun of me.
Not just in the club... but in the street as well.
Everywhere.
I'm aware that I'm ridiculous.
And there's only one place where no one is ridiculous.
And I'm going there.
Good-bye, Renato.
Don't leave!
I'm leaving you my stereo, my red boots, and my wigs.
But where are you going?
To Foissy!
Foissy?
There's nothing but a cemetery in Foissy.
That's why I'm taking the minimum.
A toothbrush to the cemetery?
-It's over, Jacob.
-I'm praying.
You know, my cemetery is in Lombardy.
It's the prettiest in the world.
There are trees.
The sky is blue.
There are birds.
Yours is for shit.
It's true.
In Foissy, they bury the dead in shit.
Forgive me for saying this, but you've become an old hag.
It's true, you're worthless, you're ridiculous.
You make people laugh.
But I'm with you.
Because you make me laugh.
So you know what I'm going to do?
Leave everything behind and go with you to the shit at Foissy.
To laugh.
Every time you're with her, the same thing happens.
In 20 years, it's just the second time!
Imagine having another child at your age.
You'd take care of the tiny tot by yourself, my dear.
I couldn't deal with a second motherhood.
What's so funny?
I'm really ready to strangle you.
I'd like to talk to you.
I know you're having problems.
I know the press is still interested in us, and so--
I wanted to tell you that... the people we're going to--
Wait!
This meat is not fresh.
I'll exchange it right away.
No, leave it.
I don't want more of the same junk.
It's shocking that a place like this would serve rotten meat!
I'll take it back.
What else can I do?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Write to Michelin.
You'll have fewer stars in the next guidebook.
That's it.
Well done, Simon.
Now what about all the people we're going to see?
Nothing.
It's nothing important.
Good, Jacob...very good.
A perfect butler.
Haven't you forgotten something?
I can't wear shoes.
I never wear them.
They make me fall!
Go on.
Go put your shoes on.
And use your normal voice.
It's better.
The little white master wanted the voice of a real black male.
Perfect, Dad.
You think so?
This suit reminds me of my grandfather.
He always dressed like this.
He killed himself when he was 30.
Remember, Dad.
As few gestures as possible.
And don't walk around, and don't talk too much.
Just what's necessary.
The minimum.
What's wrong?
I'm dressed appropriately, aren't I?
Nothing on my fingers.
Nothing on my eyes or lips.
And on your feet?
I thought a little hint of color wouldn't be out of place.
Yes, you're right.
Dressed like this I am even more ridiculous.
And I know you're thinking that, too.
Well...
I'll leave.
I'll go.
I wanted so much to help you, my little one.
It'll pass.
Who is it?
My mother.
Mr. Baldi's not here.
Who's speaking?
Is it you, Laurent?
Laurent, I can imagine what you think of me.
After your father's visit, I asked myself a lot of questions.
You may think it's a little late, but...
Listen, Laurent, your father's right.
It'll be better with a woman there.
Since I'm already on the road... if you still want me...
I'll come.
Come.
Come?
!
Have you gone crazy, Laurent?
It'll be better if she's here.
Do you know what he will do if your mother sets foot in here?
He said he wanted to help me.
He'll be good.
Come on, relax.
Everything will be fine.
Touch this.
Squeeze it hard.
We rented you for only one day, but if all goes well...
I'm willing to buy you... and get rid of my charm.
In fact, I'll do it right now.
You have your shoes on?
Go on.
I'm honored.
Please, come in.
My father.
My daughter.
Nice to meet you.
My husband.
It's a great honor.
My mother apologizes.
She'll be late.
She had to take my brothers and sisters to my grandparents'.
Andrea told us that you have a large family, Mr. Baldi.
Quite large.
How many brothers and sisters does Laurent have?
-Six.
-Six.
People don't have children anymore:
Our movement is very worried about this drop in births.
I congratulate you.
Your family should be held up as an example.
Have a seat, please.
One, two, three.
This is Charrier's chauffeur.
Just a second.
Charrier's chauffeur.
The Charriers are at "La Cage aux Folles."
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
I just left them at the owner's place.
Call Moreau in Toulon fast!
Charrier with fags!
What a story!
Did you have a good trip?
Great.
Beautiful weather, good roads.
We spent the night... near Lyon, at my friend Bouchard's.
He's someone I met in the service.
I met him again a few years later in the hotel business.
He had inherited... a large property from his father and turned it into a modern hotel.
Comfortable.
Yes, comfortable.
Very nice.
Quite good.
Quite good.
It was a pleasant...stay.
I like the severity of this room.
Well, for my father...
this house... is a place more for work and concentration... than a vacation house.
A monastery.
I captured the atmosphere right away.
I can always tell right away who I'm dealing with.
I'm pleased to say...
I feel good with a man like you.
You've seduced my husband, Mr. Baldi.
I rarely hear him give so many compliments.
In fact, I must admit... that though I'm a civil servant--
Champagne, or do you prefer something else?
No, thank you.
Just some water, please.
I never drink either, but today, I'll make an exception.
Watch what you're doing, idiot!
Nothing serious.
Champagne brings luck.
Go on, Jacob.
We'll handle it.
Can I help you?
Jacob's a good fellow, but he still has a lot to learn.
Help is really a problem these days.
If I told you how many chauffeurs I've had this year...
You must have even more trouble since you travel so much.
Here I am.
I'm here!
Here's Mother!
Please forgive me.
I'm terribly sorry, but the traffic--
Every day it gets worse.
It's becoming impossible.
Mr. Charrier, thrilled to meet you!
I've been dying to meet the father of that naughty girl... who's stealing my baby.
The naughty thing!
Dear Madam, I'm just joking.
I already like the child.
What a sweet thing!
How about a kiss?
How about a kiss for your second mother?
Come here, darling.
I already love her.
She's adorable.
She's frightened, poor dear.
Come here.
Don't be afraid.
She's adorable.
Give me a cigarette.
Go warn your mother not to come.
Thanks.
Excuse me for a moment.
Where's the boy going?
Dinner is served.
-Jacob, what's come over you?
-Nothing.
Nothing at all.
-Servants are such a problem.
-We were just saying that.
It's close to impossible to get good help these days.
You can't imagine how many maids have passed through here.
And one's as clumsy as the next.
Not mean, just inept.
I could name a dozen-- Roger, Marcel, Luciano...
Dinner.
No need to be so nasty.
Magnificent.
That Christ is splendid.
-Yes.
My father.
-Pardon me?
My father, he restored it.
My father loved antiques.
Mr. Charrier on my right.
Renato on my left.
Mrs. Charrier there, and the girl across from mama.
Please, sit down.
These plates are very unusual.
They're pictures of young men playing together.
We have so many plates, I can't really say which ones those are.
From the 16th century.
I think they are Greek figures.
Greeks on my plates?
How did they get there?
Would you like to see it?
I can't see without my glasses.
They're two young men, aren't they?
Two young men.
Young men?
But there must be some girls, too.
Yes, I think I saw one.
What a cute child.
She's right, of course.
There, there's one.
There's a girl there.
Isn't that a girl?
Then I haven't seen one in a long time.
My goodness!
It's two boys, for sure.
They're naked.
Where are my glasses?
I'll be back in a minute.
Idiot!
He uses the dishes with the naked Greeks!
I can never find my glasses.
Let's see.
Peasant soup Martinique style.
Jacob's specialty!
Oh, I'm sorry, Madam.
Jacob, take over.
Poor Mrs. Charrier is holding our Lord in her arms.
My apologies.
I am really sorry.
This way, please.
Bon appetit.
There are only two entrances, here and at the club.
Morin and Chauvet, wait at the club.
Will you stay on the Coast for long?
No.
I don't like to be away from my constituency for too long.
-From your...?
-From my work.
And also the ambiance of this area, the dissipation... the loose morals... make me sick.
Doesn't that nightclub downstairs bother you?
A nightclub?
Yes.
And quite an ill-reputed one.
It's called "La Cage aux Folles."
Oh, yes, "La Cage aux Folles."
You're right above it!
You share walls with those people!
Just the walls.
Just the walls.
We're not friendly with them.
That's another world.
But...who owns the building?
We do!
You rent your cellar to the owner of a nightclub?
Yes, Yes!
But we didn't know he was a... nightclub owner!
Naturally...we didn't know it.
He's a man... who doesn't say much.
He's so reserved.
It's just, "Hello, good-bye."
He's not one to say, "Hey, I'm going...
I'm going to put...
"a nightclub in your cellar."
Excuse me.
We should talk about the wedding.
Laurent is not here, but...
These are things that parents should discuss.
Though our kids have already decided.
What do you think of the kids' decision?
I must say that at first I was a little against it.
But when my daughter spoke so highly of your family... of its respectability...
When your daughter told you...
about our family?
Yes, it...reassured me.
I thought that Andrea was... too young to get married, and your son, as well.
But since they're in love...
and won't listen to reason... since they chose each other--
Since they chose each other?
Well, I must admit that at first, we, too... were somewhat opposed to this marriage.
Especially me!
It's always hard on a mother... when her son leaves her for another woman.
You'll say that's life.
Sure, that's life.
At some point, children leave.
It's a law, but...
Excuse us.
Come, honey.
But we're discussing important things.
Excuse me.
What's so urgent?
What's the matter with you?
Look at yourself in the mirror!
All right, so it moved a little.
-What were you thinking of?
-They believe it.
All three were lovely to me.
I made a big impression.
Big impression?
If they find out, everything's ruined.
I'm not doing it for you, but for Laurent.
And it's working fine.
On stage, perhaps.
Makeup and cream aren't enough here.
The Deputy surely noticed your hairy hands!
A hostess doesn't leave her guests.
It isn't polite.
Albin, stay here!
My wig!
Renato, give me back my wig!
Give me back my wig!
They're not expecting this.
It'll be a big surprise!
Mr. Baldi is upstairs.
I'm Laurent's mother.
Follow me, Madam.
Happy anniversary to you...
How rude!
Leaving us alone like this!
And the son disappearing before dinner.
Maybe he had an errand to run.
And that woman is strange.
She has a way of speaking--
When she comes out with that "uh-uh-uh," I sense something.
I think she's nice.
Did someone knock?
Well, where's that butler?
Who's there?
It's Laurent's mother, Mr. Baldi.
Laurent's mother?
It's me, Renato.
Open up.
Her voice has changed.
Who's there?
Laurent's mother.
Mr. Baldi isn't here.
I haven't the key.
The key's in the nook by the door.
In the nook.
What nook?
On the left!
Mr. Charrier, I'm Simone Baldi.
Nice to meet you.
You have an adorable daughter, Madam.
My compliments.
She's gorgeous!
I knew my son had taste, but...
Your son, Mr. Baldi... how many mothers has he got?
Would you repeat the question, please?
I'm asking you how many mothers your son has got.
Just one.
Albin.
"La Cage aux Folles..."
Dad...
let me explain.
What kind of story did you tell me?
!
Cultural attaché?
!
Housewife!
Stop it!
I was afraid to tell you.
I've been afraid of you for 18 years.
Simon!
Let's go.
Right away.
Come on.
Let's get going!
No, I'm staying.
Then stay!
I no longer have a daughter!
I no longer have a daughter.
Reporters!
Reporters.
That's the last straw.
A nice white wedding, huh?
In great splendor!
With the Pope's blessing!
What good is that photo?
It's shit!
What can you see?
A door with Charrier behind it?
What good is that?
I can see the headlines in tomorrow's papers.
"Sequel to President Berthier and His Whore."
"Deputy Charrier Frolics With Transvestites."
Mr. Deputy, take a look at this door.
There's no neon sign.
You can leave.
The bastards.
They've blocked the door.
This way they are forcing you to leave through the nightclub.
Through the nightclub?
They'll be waiting there.
Through the nightclub...
with the transvestites...
No.
We'll call the police.
A ladder.
Do you have a ladder?
Not again, Simon.
I'm ruined...
I'm ruined!
Renato, the poor man is really in a bind.
And his wife, too.
She's in the shit with him.
They're pitiful.
Well, I'll have to save the day...as usual.
You want to get out of here, right?
No scandal, no publicity.
It's the first time, but you'll get used to it.
Then you can do it yourself.
You're gorgeous.
You look awful.
White makes me look fat.
I wanted black!
What are you saying?
He's a great girl!
Hurry, and wiggle a little.
Mercedes, dance with her and move her towards the exit.
Would you like to dance?
Get going, you gutsy thing.
To the hotel!
Hurry!
To the hotel!
-How much?
-How much?
It's me, your boss!
-Calm down, Madam.
-Madam?
!
Don't you recognize me?
The idiot called me a whore!
See that?
She came.
I knew she would.
I told you I didn't want her here.
She's my son's mother.
It's normal for her to be here.
No, it's not normal!
The model mother...
now, after so many years.
Listen, if that witch goes to the reception, I won't.
-Please, Albin.
-I won't go!
That's the only way.
That's really easy.
-Please.
-Please like hell!
I'm fed up.
And you tell Laurent.
He'll understand because he loves me.
He'll understand that the day of his wedding I had to leave--
{\move\fad\fscx25\fscy25\t\cHO00000\3cHO0FFFF}anoXmous
Take a bow, ladies.
Very nice, my pets.
And now, the great, the wonderful Mercedes!
80,000 francs tonight.
- Where the hell is she?
I'll go get her.
Mr. Baldi?
Bastard!
Mr. Baldi, she has to come down now.
Mercedes just went on.
You handle it.
I can't take any more.
I'm going to kill her.
Good house tonight, Mr. Baldi.
- What's the take?
- 12,000 more than yesterday.
Shall we do something about the prince's tab?
No more freebies.
Is it a big bill?
- 5,000 francs.
- How many people?
Two.
Coffee's on the house this time.
I had no luck.
- Insist!
- I did!
It's no use.
Have Mercedes do four extra songs.
Great show, Renato.
Ah, Mr. Baldi.
I'll get my bag.
I'm sorry to bother you, but she refuses to get up.
Were you in the middle of dinner?
She's on in ten minutes, and she's not even made up.
No!
It's me, Zaza.
The doctor.
I'm not presentable!
Come on, show yourself.
Let the doctor see Zaza.
I look hideous!
Just hideous!
Zaza, your fans are waiting, and my dinner's getting cold.
Please be reasonable.
Doctor, I'm so miserable.
If you only knew!
You're just a little depressed.
It will pass.
I want to die, Doctor.
You were having dinner?
Can it be reheated?
Rabbit in mustard sauce.
That's easy to reheat.
Here's what you do.
Reduce the sauce in a frying pan.
But make sure it's copper.
I always tell my friends, "It has to be copper."
Otherwise -
- Are you dying or cooking?
Shut up, you!
It's your fault I'm like this.
Look what I've become, thanks to you.
A human wreck.
A worthless old rag.
I had gorgeous shoulders before I met you!
Look at them now -
It's the same thing every night.
I taped it yesterday.
The games he plays while I suffer!
Want to lip-synch the rest?
- I'll give him a shot.
- No, no shots!
And have his understudy go on.
No, I'll behave.
All right.
So we'll go downstairs and work now?
Any tranquilizers left?
- There must be one or two,
I'm sure.
Two pills after the show, as usual.
I'll be going.
- Good-bye, Doctor.
The season's just started.
What'll I do if he gets sick?
Close the club?
It's nothing serious.
He's just a bit tired.
Be nice and humor him, and everything will be fine.
Good night, and thanks again.
You know what time it is?
You want to put us out of business?
You're doing this on purpose.
Why are you powdering your legs?
Nobody sees them onstage.
Indifference is a horrible thing, Renato.
I dieted for two months, and you didn't even notice
I'd lost weight.
I wrecked my health for you with diet pills and diuretics, but nothing... not a word.
Not one encouraging word.
You don't even notice me.
You don't love me anymore.
Just the other day
I bought a little outfit.
I wore it to please you... and nothing.
Albin, I'll go crazy if you keep on like this.
Everything's possible.
You don't love me anymore, Renato.
After all these years, I'm just a meal ticket to you, not a queen of the theater.
You're cheating on me.
Here we go again.
I know there's a man in your life.
There's no man... just 250 people waiting for the leading lady to take the stage.
They've come to applaud you, the great Zaza Napoli.
What do you do while I'm onstage?
Where do you go while I kill myself onstage?
Go on.
Hit me.
- How is it?
- Don't worry.
Everything will be fine, poodle.
It doesn't hurt.
It's nothing.
Did you hurt your little hand?
- No.
Now hurry -
- You still love me?
Of course.
Now hurry.
What?
My fan.
Jacob will bring it down.
I can't sing without my fan.
Jacob, bring Zaza's fan downstairs.
Now hurry.
Evening, ladies.
Keep it down back here!
Announce Albin.
Albin, please!
No more chocolate.
I'm tired of playing second fiddle to that floozy.
Keep it down.
Your comrade is performing.
I could have finished out the show tonight!
That's enough now.
Am I doing four songs or eight?
- We'll discuss it tomorrow.
- No, tonight!
I won't hang on madame's every mood.
- Let the fat cow go on lazing in bed!
- Don't talk about Albin like that!
You'll wear men's clothes from now on.
- No, not that!
You asked for it, Henri!
That's right
- Henri!
- Where's that damn fan?
- It's coming.
Jacob!
I've told you not to prance about naked.
- You don't like it?
Why won't you let me dance?
Watch.
What do the others have that I don't?
You have a little extra something.
You can cook.
Now hurry.
I'm counting on you.
How did I end up with a maid like that!
What now?
May I speak with you a moment?
It's late, and I have an appointment.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Petunia... what have you done now?
- I'm expecting a baby.
- What?
I'm expecting a baby.
You got your wife pregnant again?
That makes seven!
How can you hope to have a career?
Come here.
Just look in the mirror.
All this breeding is wearing you out.
You're looking older by the day.
It's true.
AII right, I'll tell the office to give you maternity pay.
No, no.
Back to work now.
You're so kind.
You don't come cheap, you know.
Jacob, get that thing off your head, or I'll tell Albin you wear his wigs.
And I'll tell her you have romantic suppers while she works.
Back in the kitchen, you twit!
Come here.
You're more handsome than ever.
How about a drink?
Scotch?
Champagne?
Make it champagne.
Is he onstage?
Yes, for two more hours, so we won't be disturbed.
- And Jacob?
- I gave him the night off, sweetheart.
We're all alone.
You're looking good too.
No...
I'm all bloated.
I work too much and get upset, and I swell up.
You really think I look good?
- Very good.
You're very sweet.
I guess I do still have my figure.
I have something important to tell you.
This isn't easy.
I'm getting married.
I was going to write you a letter.
She's a great girl.
I know you'll like her.
You upset?
On the contrary.
I should be happy.
I always hoped you wouldn't be -
I mean, that you'd fall in love with a girl.
No, it's fine.
I raise a boy for 20 years, my own son... then some girl comes along and steals him away.
The bitch!
That's right - the bitch!
I'm sorry.
Listen, Laurent.
Marry her and you're never setting foot in here again.
And not another cent.
Good-bye for good.
You choose.
Good-bye, Dad.
You little dummy.
Come here.
Let's toast this catastrophe.
Did you think that would work?
No, but one can always try.
Let the celebration begin.
A marriage calls for a drink.
To the bride!
What's the little slut's name?
- Dad, please.
- Sorry.
What's the young lady's name?
- Andrea.
So you've been living with a boy in Paris for a year and only tell us now?
Answer me!
Answer!
You're frightening her, Simon.
Don't be so hard on her.
Mother, that's enough.
He's a very nice boy, Father.
Very responsible.
He mentioned marriage first.
What do his parents do?
Hold on.
For you.
Yes, I told them.
What about you?
I told my dad too.
He's delighted.
The slut!
He opened the champagne.
We were just celebrating.
I have the glass in my hand.
Listen.
To our love, Andrea.
I'll put him on.
Here's to your happiness, Andrea.
Shit!
Sorry, I just broke a glass.
Just plain glass.
It's good luck.
Here.
The little bitch!
Your father's nice.
Listen, I'm with my parents.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
No, don't worry.
Me too.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Everything went just fine.
I'm so happy.
Did you hear how good the connection was?
As if they were next door.
Their voices were so clear.
Well... it's late.
Good night.
Andrea, we asked what the young man's parents do.
His parents?
Nothing.
I mean... they're vacationing on the Riviera.
They can't always be on vacation!
So what does his father do?
His father is... in the arts.
- The arts?
I mean...
he's in cultural affairs.
He's a cultural attaché - that's it.
At the Italian embassy.
Excellent!
He's a diplomat!
A good career!
Why didn't you say so?
Does his mother work?
His mother?
No, she looks after the children.
She has loads of them.
Hello, Mr. Albin.
Hello, Mr. Lefevre.
The boy's home.
- Then perhaps a nice roast?
- Yes, I'll pick it up later.
- How are you, Mr. Albin?
- Fine, thanks.
I need some pasta and Parmesan.
- The boy's home?
Yes, and I've got to dash.
- Hello, Mr. Lafargue.
- The usual, Mr. Albin?
Yes, a cake with the inscription...
"To my Lolo from Auntie."
To my Lolo from Auntie.
I've got to run.
He'll be waking up any minute.
- Shall I deliver it?
- No, Jacob will stop in.
I'm taking a chocolate, okay?
Bye.
Who did I spy this morning?
The little white master.
Your coffee really stinks.
You French make shitty coffee.
I've been called black, and I've been called queer, but never French.
Yoo-hoo, it's me!
The grocery lady.
- Morning, you.
- Morning, mistress.
Did you have a wild night out, you beast?
Careful with these.
There are strawberries on the bottom.
And don't forget to pick up the cake at noon.
Good morning, you.
My God, your beard's rough.
He's still asleep?
I peeked in earlier.
He's so handsome!
You might have told me he was coming and spared yourself that scene last night.
But the fact is you can't stand sharing your son.
So you hide him from me and try to push me aside.
My stars, am I hungry!
You look awful this morning.
What's wrong?
He's getting married.
What?
My son's getting married.
Don't be silly.
I got him some sole.
He loves sole, just like me.
I wanted lobster, but it's too expensive, so I got sole.
But that's funny, what you just said.
A week ago I dreamed he was getting married.
We were all in church, crying our eyes out.
You weren't serious.
Some girl he met at school.
It was bound to happen.
He's marrying a girl?
How awful!
Poor boy.
It can't be.
He's too -
He's still so young.
He'll ruin his life.
I told him all that, of course.
But it was no use.
He thinks he'll be happy, and maybe he will.
There was nothing I could do.
It hurts, hearing it out of the blue like that.
I wasn't expecting it.
It's quite a blow.
I was feeling fine, and now suddenly my liver's acting up.
But it'll pass.
The little bitch!
I see you told him.
Here's the little jerk now.
How about a kiss for your Auntie?
They're taking him from us, and we won't have any others.
Unless there's a miracle.
I've given this marriage a lot of thought, Simon.
Miss Corre... in the president's speech, replace "riff-raff" with "derelicts."
Imagine Mrs. Simoneau's face if we marry a diplomat's son!
No, Miss Corre... instead of the word "derelicts"... put "degenerates."
What with your background, this is quite a match.
You, a policeman's son.
Don't start that again, Louise!
I'm tired of hearing, "You, a policeman's son"!
I've had it, you hear?
Now look what you made me do!
Andrea's too young to marry.
The subject is closed.
Speaking.
Dear God!
What is it?
President Berthier died.
The president?
Dear God!
In a woman's arms.
A prostitute.
And a minor.
A minor... and black!
What?
A black, underage prostitute.
My career's ruined.
Why, Simon?
You're not responsible.
You hear me?
You're not responsible for the president's private life.
Louise, I'm secretary general of a party called the Union for Moral Order, and our president just died in the arms of a prostitute.
Just wait till the press gets wind of this.
I could use a little piece of chocolate.
No!
They wrote "Uncle"!
I told them Auntie!
"To my Lolo from his Auntie."
He has no uncle.
Okay, I'll shut up now.
Smells good.
Feeling better, huh?
Oh, he'll come visit... and he'll bring that girl.
Speaking of which, we'll have to do something about the bedroom.
It's barely large enough for a couple, and there'll be grandchildren.
Look at me.
I can just see you!
You, a grandfather... pushing a baby carriage, with all your gold chains.
Shall I crack an egg?
- No, I'm the boss in the kitchen.
Ah, the kitchen is your realm?
You're the star onstage.
Let me work here.
Then I'm off to the stage.
Good.
Go on.
No, go around!
Mr. Charrier isn't in.
No, he won't be home for lunch.
It hasn't stopped ringing all morning.
And no sign of your father.
Mother?
I...
I have something to tell you.
It's about Laurent's parents.
Don't worry.
We'll talk about it later with your father.
- That's just what I don't want.
- No, you'll see.
We have a wonderful surprise for you.
What are you doing out there?
Did you see them at the front door?
I preferred a ladder.
It's dangerous.
You could have fallen.
I did fall!
Now you know what my morning's been like.
I tell you, I'm leaving.
The reporters keep calling... with their sniggers and sneers.
I can't take it anymore!
It's not just reporters!
Everyone's sneering and roaring with laughter!
And who are they laughing at?
Who's the butt of their jokes?
Me!
Thanks to Berthier, the Moral Order has become one big joke!
Thanks a lot, Mr. President!
Dirty old pig!
There is a solution, Simon.
A big white wedding.
What?
As soon as possible.
It'll restore your image.
Morality, family, tradition.
Your daughter marries a diplomat's son.
The president and the prostitute - forgotten.
Marry off Andrea, with the pope's blessing if need be.
Louise, listen... things are bad enough.
If you start babbling nonsense, I'll crack.
We have to marry her off in great splendor.
You'll be the symbol of tradition once again.
Where do the young man's parents live?
I won't do just anything.
I'm a professional!
Hire beginners if you want, but don't let them bother the true artists!
Just watch what Mr. Salomé does while I dance!
You make me rehearse at all hours, made-up and in costume.
But the others get away with anything!
It's unfair!
Come here, you.
You need to learn the Queen of Broadway number.
You're doing any old thing!
I'm fed up!
Dad, I have to talk to you.
Being long and lean and 20 doesn't make you talented, sweetie.
- Dad, it's important.
- Can't you see he's rehearsing?
- Did you see what he did?
- No, I was talking to Laurent.
He's blowing bubbles!
While I sing!
He shouldn't blow bubbles while I'm singing!
Why are you blowing bubbles in his face?
It's annoying.
This may be a drag revue, but it still should be good drama.
Concentrate.
You know what your character's all about?
You're a handsome stranger, strolling down Broadway with a manly gait, when suddenly you see this beautiful apparition.
You look at her and feel a delightful sensual charge in your pelvis.
Like this.
You try.
That's a bit much.
What is it now?
I'll be right back.
Go on without me.
- Can we talk a minute?
- What is it?
Let's go upstairs.
Andrea's coming with her parents.
- So?
- They want to meet you.
- You interrupt me for that?
She told them you're a cultural attaché and Albin's a housewife.
That girl's crazy!
Remember what you told me my first day of school?
I do, very clearly.
You said to tell them you were a businessman.
So?
Her father has to be more open-minded than your grade-school teachers.
No, Dad.
Less.
Deputy Charrier of the Moral Order - does that ring a bell?
So she said you were a cultural attaché and a housewife.
So what do we do now?
Do I sell the club and become a diplomat?
What about Albin?
Snip!
To the operating room?
If her father finds out she lied, that's it.
Be nice and help us.
- How?
If you could send Albin away for a few days -
You try and send Albin away!
And get rid of a few things here.
Like what?
Like that.
I don't know.
And this.
The discus thrower?
Why?
And that.
Is that all?
I don't know.
Try to make it simpler, less cluttered.
Know what I mean?
So we have to redecorate too?
Make it into a dream home for House and Garden?
We're not changing a thing.
You got that?
And you could make a little effort yourself.
What do you mean?
You could be a little less conspicuous, you know.
I'm conspicuous?
Laurent, I just had that painted.
Albin and Salomé are fighting.
Albin's trying to grab his gum.
Yes, I wear makeup.
Yes, I live with a man.
Yes, I'm an old fag.
But after 20 years I know who I really am, and your stupid deputy isn't going to ruin that.
Your deputy can go to hell!
Screw your silly deputy!
Going on a trip?
Saint-Tropez.
- What are you doing?
- I'm not talking to them!
Go out the front door and talk to them.
- Let me go!
- We agreed to announce the news.
Then you do it.
It was your idea.
I'm climbing down.
Tell the driver to come around.
- Leaving us?
- Going to your president's funeral?
What's the future of the Union for Moral Order?
I have just one thing to say.
I'm off for a few days to organize an event that epitomizes the spirit of our movement.
My, my!
The little white master's in a bad mood.
He said I dress like a whore.
- He's right.
Starting tonight you're to dress like a real butler.
And put this in the basement.
And that too.
And get rid of all this froufrou, all these pillows.
Get rid of it all.
Especially this.
Never mind.
Thanks, Dad.
Laurent, don't bug me.
I have to talk to poor Albin now.
What am I going to tell him?
"Get lost, fat cow"?
"You're in the way, you old fag"?
You don't have to put it like that.
- You all right?
- It's blazing today.
You shouldn't be out in the sun, you know.
It feels good.
No, in your condition suntanning isn't advisable.
What do you mean?
Have you looked in the mirror today?
- Why?
- You look green.
No, I'm tan.
That's right.
A greenish tan.
That's what worries me.
I think you really need a vacation.
A vacation?
I feel just fine.
Fine.
Forget I mentioned it.
Why did you say that?
You're frightening me.
Are you hiding something from me?
Did the doctor say something?
No, absolutely not.
No, I just thought since you're a bit on edge and depressed, maybe a few days off wouldn't hurt.
My dear Renato...
I may not be too bright, but when the I's are dotted,
I end up getting the point.
You're trying to get rid of me.
I wasn't born yesterday.
I know all the tricks, and what you're trying to do isn't right.
It's beneath you.
You know what day it is?
June 25.
That's right.
Our anniversary.
Twenty years we've lived together.
It warms the heart.
And you picked this day to lie to me in the most despicable way and cheat on me.
- Do you want Laurent to be happy?
- What's that got to do with it?
If you want him to be happy, you'll go away.
- The little white master called?
- Cut it out, and take that statue away.
- Right now?
- Yes, there's no time to lose.
You're turning me out, banishing me like a leper!
You're ashamed of me!
I stayed up nights at that boy's bedside.
I sacrificed everything for him.
I gave him my life!
Albin, listen.
No, you listen to me!
Either I'm here tonight where I belong to welcome those people, or I'm never setting foot in this house again!
What?
Laurent, couldn't you have waited a while?
It's all right.
I get the point.
I'm being thrown out... driven from my own home.
It doesn't matter.
I'll go and leave you in peace.
The freak is leaving.
Happy now?
Come inside.
Come back inside.
Come cry inside.
Albin, stop acting like a fool!
I hate you.
You've ruined everything.
It's all right.
You can stay.
I don't feel very well.
All this emotion is too much for me.
Feel my pulse.
This is the end.
Let's go get a little something.
This is the end!
You're just weak.
You haven't eaten all day.
Sit down.
Hello, Mr. Renato, Mr. Albin.
Hello, Marcel.
Two teas and toast.
- Isn't he feeling well?
- He's just overtired.
Lie down a moment.
No, he'll feel better after some tea.
Unsalted toast.
What will we do about tonight?
That's a problem.
What are we going to tell them?
Two men like us...
You're sweet.
That feels good.
I don't know.
Maybe I could be a relative.
Maybe his uncle.
Couldn't you say I'm his uncle?
True, I don't look like an uncle.
But you don't exactly look the part either.
Didn't he say you were a cultural attaché?
Cultural attaché my foot!
We've got a real problem.
Here we are.
Tea and toast.
Feeling better?
- Thank you.
Cultural attaché?
Look how you eat.
You just shovel it in.
Your pinky.
What's it doing up in the air?
Look at it!
What of it?
It just does it by itself.
Tell that to the deputy tonight.
Let's try and make this uncle into a man.
You have to learn how a man holds a piece of toast:
firmly, like this.
And he spreads the butter just as firmly.
And he drinks his tea calmly and keeps his pinky down.
First of all, sit up straight.
- What's wrong now?
Don't whine every time I correct you.
It's for your own good.
Come on, try.
I'd like you to be presentable tonight.
Let's take it from the toast and butter.
Like a man.
Don't be afraid to be firm.
You did that on purpose!
Try again.
Take another piece.
- I'll never get it.
Now you're blubbering again.
That's enough.
Hold it firmly in your little hand, decisive and strong.
An iron hand in a velvet glove.
A real man's piece of toast!
Now on to something harder.
- A little jam?
- Pick up the spoon.
- I pick up the little spoon.
Not like that!
You look like you're ringing a bell.
It's just a spoon.
Hold it boldly, without trembling!
If you want to kill me, just say so.
Go for the eyes.
They're a sure thing.
I'll never get it.
I broke my toast.
Fine, that's unfortunate, but in a situation like this, it's important to take it like a man.
You understand?
- Of course.
You're right.
You have to say calmly to yourself,
"Albin, so you broke it.
It's not a big deal.
Your life isn't over."
Try another piece.
- You're right.
It's not like it's the end of the world.
There's still some toast left.
Careful with your pinky there!
- It does it all by itself.
That's enough now.
Blow.
Now let's go home.
Wait.
I want to freshen up a bit.
What did I do?
- What kind of walk is that?
- What about it?
Walk like that tonight and our goose is cooked.
- What am I going to do?
- Come here.
What do you want?
- Try to walk like John Wayne.
- The cowboy?
Yes, John Wayne.
You get down off your horse.
You head for the saloon.
You fling open the doors, and pow!
Try it.
- Like John Wayne?
That's Miss John Wayne.
Hey, queer.
One of them called me a queer.
He's gonna show him!
Did you call my friend a queer?
The swelling's gone down.
It's nothing.
You were wonderful!
Marvelous!
I'm proud of you.
That big goon looked so silly sitting on top of you and banging your head on the floor.
I felt sorry for him.
He's a big brute with nothing better to do.
What a loser!
No, let me.
I'll get some ice.
That'll be better.
Be right back, my love.
I have some bad news for you.
I gave in and told him to stay.
- Why?
Because I thought I'd have to carry him out on a stretcher, because we've been together for years, and because he owns 80% of the club.
- So how will you introduce him?
- As your uncle.
We're done for now!
Calm down.
Don't be so mule-headed.
Can't we talk it over?
Of course, it would be better if we had a woman here.
Funny, isn't it?
We need a woman here for once.
What about asking your mother?
- Out of the question!
- Why?
She abandoned me 20 years ago.
I'm not asking her for a thing!
Your attitude isn't helping much.
Fine.
I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it.
You can't be serious.
You'd go see that woman after what she did to us?
You're out of your mind.
Why?
Excuse me.
Madame Deblon?
Speak to her secretary.
Come in.
May I see Madame Deblon?
- You have an appointment?
- Just tell her it's Renato Baldi.
I doubt she'll see you without an appointment.
She's very busy.
Please try.
It's urgent.
Renato Baldi.
Wait outside.
Madame Deblon will see you.
- I'm coming with you.
- No, please.
I won't leave you alone with that woman.
I know what she's capable of.
Madame Deblon is waiting.
I'm coming.
It's you I love.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
My dear madame president.
Well, well, this is quite a surprise.
Sit down.
I never drink in the morning, but for this occasion -
Whatever brings you here?
- Laurent.
Nothing serious?
Very.
He wants to get married.
Already?
How old is he?
Old enough.
You haven't seen the boy in almost 20 years.
I know.
Did you come to scold me?
No.
But today, for the first time, he needs you.
Fine.
I'll cancel my plans and join you tonight.
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.
I haven't done much for him in 20 years.
I often feel bad about it.
- You needn't.
I'm just not the maternal type.
I am.
It's true.
He was lucky.
What time tonight?
8:00.
We'll put on our little show and then send them on their merry way.
- You remember the revue?
- How could I forget?
You were so handsome!
I'd never seen such a body.
You're embarrassing me, talking like that.
Remember how scared you were?
I almost had a heart attack.
I walk in my room and find a woman in my bed!
I gave the concierge 50 francs, a nice sum back then.
I was so drunk.
Otherwise I'd never have dared think,
"Why not give it a try?
You have to try everything once, right?
I've heard so much about it.
What have I got to lose?
I'll give it a try."
How long did it last between us?
I can tell you exactly.
From 2:30 to 3:45... twice.
Hot in here, isn't it?
- You haven't changed.
- Really?
You put on a little weight, but it looks good on you.
Makes you... more virile.
What's all this hair?
You didn't have it back then.
- I shaved it for the stage.
- You shaved it?
He shaved it all off...
Careful, Simone.
I like hairy chests.
Careful, this is a crepe shirt, and with those nails -
Now I've got a run!
What does that red light mean?
That madame is not to be disturbed for any reason.
Have you seen my glasses?
Where are they?
Ah, here we go.
"The death of President Berthier." Nothing.
Excellent.
"Exemplary career... heart attack."
Nothing there either.
Excellent.
Nothing there either.
Sometimes having friends in the press comes in handy.
I knew it!
I just knew it!
The filthy scandal sheet!
Two whole columns!
"The Happy Death of President Berthier." Those rats!
Calm down, Simon.
Listen to this:
"The last words uttered by Berthier, champion of the Moral Order, were, 'Don't forget my little gift!"'
The vultures!
Forget all that muck, Simon.
Think of the purpose of this trip.
I have to return it to the antique dealer tomorrow.
And I redecorated the entire living room.
I hope your friends appreciate it.
What's going on?
Thank you, Jacob.
I'd have liked to have seen your children.
Don't go, mistress!
Don't go!
My faithful Jacob.
What is this?
Uncle Tom's Cabin?
I know what you're thinking.
I'm a laughingstock.
Not just in the club... but in the street too.
Everywhere.
Oh, I know I look ridiculous.
And there's just one place where no one looks ridiculous.
That's where I'm going.
Good-bye, Renato.
Mistress, don't go!
I'm leaving you my stereo, my red boots, and my wigs.
Just where are you going?
Foissy.
There's nothing in Foissy but a cemetery.
That's why I'm taking the bare minimum.
You're taking a toothbrush to the grave?
That's enough, Jacob.
I'm praying, master.
You know, my cemetery is in Lombardy.
It's the most beautiful cemetery in the world, with trees and birds and a blue sky.
Makes your cemetery here in Foissy look like shit.
Literally.
The dead here are up to their ears in shit.
Forgive me, but you're just a bitter old bitch.
You've lost your sex appeal, you're grotesque, and everyone laughs at you.
Yet here I am, still at your side, because you make me laugh.
So you know what I'm going to do?
Sell my plot in Lombardy and lie by you here in the shit in Foissy so we can go on laughing.
Every time you're alone with that woman, it's the same thing.
It's only the second time in 20 years.
Precisely!
Imagine having a second child at your age.
Because you're on your own next time, old girl.
I'm not going through motherhood again.
What's so funny?
I feel like strangling you again.
Could I talk to you a minute?
I know you're having problems at the moment... and that reporters will be following us for a few more days.
I wanted to tell you that... the people we're visiting -
Wait a minute.
Maître-d'!
I'll be right with you, sir.
This meat isn't fresh.
I'll replace it, sir.
No!
I'm not waiting hours for another piece!
But a restaurant like this serving rotten meat - it's scandalous!
If you don't wish to send it back, what else can I do?
I know what I'm going to do:
write to Michelin.
You'll have fewer stars in their next guidebook.
You may go.
Well done, Simon.
Now, about the people we're visiting...?
No, nothing.
It's not important.
Very nice!
Just like a real butler.
Aren't you forgetting something?
I can't wear shoes.
They make me trip.
Go put some shoes on.
And use your normal voice.
It's much better.
The little master wanted the voice of a real black male.
Get out of here!
- You look great, Dad.
- Think so?
This suit reminds me of my grandfather.
He dressed just like this.
He killed himself when he was 30.
Remember, Dad:
as few gestures as possible.
Don't fidget.
Don't talk.
Just the bare minimum.
The bare minimum?
Well?
No good?
I dressed as appropriately as I could.
I took off all my rings.
No makeup.
And your feet?
Of course, there's still a touch of color.
You're right.
I look even more outrageous like this.
That's what you're thinking, isn't it?
And I agree.
So...
I'll be going.
I'll just go.
I wanted so much to help you, my child.
Mr. Baldi, please.
- Who's calling?
- Simone Deblon.
It's my mother.
Mr. Baldi's not in.
Who's this?
Laurent?
I want you to know...
I've thought a lot since your father's visit.
Maybe it's a bit late for that now, but listen to me.
Your father's right.
You'll do better with a woman there.
I'm at a gas station on the highway.
If you still want me to come, I will.
Come.
What?
Have you lost your mind?
It'll be better with her here.
Do you know what he'll do if Simone sets foot in here?
He said he wanted to help me.
He'll behave.
Relax.
It'll be fine.
Touch this, quickly.
That antique dealer is a thief, but if all goes well, I'll buy you.
I'll get rid of my good-luck charm.
In fact, you can have it now.
You have shoes on?
Go let them in.
It's a pleasure.
Nice to meet you.
Please come in.
My father.
It's a pleasure.
My daughter.
Nice to meet you.
My husband.
It's a great honor.
My mother will be a bit late.
She went to visit my brothers and sisters vacationing at my grandparents'.
Andrea said you have a very large family.
Quite large.
How many brothers and sisters does Laurent have?
Six.
People don't have enough children anymore.
Our movement is very concerned about this drop in the birthrate.
Allow me to congratulate you.
Your family should be held up as an example.
Please sit down.
One, two, three.
- Charrier's chauffeur here.
- Hold the line.
It's Charrier's chauffeur.
The Charriers are dining with the owners of La Cage aux Folles.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I just dropped them off.
You can check for yourself.
- Get Moreau in Toulon fast.
Charrier and the fags - this is too rich!
Did you have a nice trip?
Very nice.
Splendid weather, good roads.
Everything was fine.
We spent the night near Lyon, at my friend Bouchard's place, a fellow I met in the service and then ran into years later who's now in the hotel business.
He inherited a little place from his father and turned it into a modern hotel... that's very comfortable and pleasant.
It was nice.
Just fine.
A pleasant stopover.
Wasn't it?
It was... pleasant.
I like the austerity of this room.
Yes, for my father this house is more a place for work and reflection than a vacation home.
A monastery.
I'm very sensitive to my surroundings.
The moment I walk in the door, I know who I'm dealing with.
And I'm pleased to say
I feel very comfortable here.
My husband's fallen for your charms.
He rarely pays anyone such a compliment.
I must admit that though I'm a civil servant,
I'm actually -
Perhaps you'd prefer something besides champagne?
Port?
Whiskey?
Ma'am?
No, just a little water, please.
I never drink either, but I think I might make an exception today.
Watch what you're doing, you twit!
No harm done.
Champagne brings good luck.
That'll do, Jacob.
I'll pour.
Can I help you?
Jacob is very nice, but he still has a lot to learn.
It's so hard to get good help these days.
If you knew how many chauffeurs I've gone through this year!
It must be even harder for you, with all the traveling that diplomats do.
Here I am!
It's me.
It's Mother.
Please forgive me, but traffic these days!
The traffic jams are really becoming impossible.
Please forgive me.
Good evening.
I'm simply thrilled to meet you, the father of that naughty girl who's stealing away my big boy!
The naughty thing!
Excuse me.
Hello, my dear.
I'm just joking, of course.
I like the dear child already.
She's so cute!
Well, do we get a kiss?
How about a kiss for Mommy?
Come here, darling.
I like her already.
She's adorable.
She's nervous, of course.
Come here.
Do I scare you?
What a cute young thing!
You have a cigarette?
Go try and stop your mother.
Explain what's happened.
Excuse me a moment.
Where's the boy going?
Dinner is served.
Jacob, what's come over you?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Help is such a problem these days!
We were just saying that.
It's close to impossible to find good help these days.
You're telling me!
You can't imagine the number of maids we've gone through here, each as clumsy as the next.
Not bad girls.
Just inept.
I could name half a dozen:
Roger, Marcel, Lucien -
Dinner!
Fine!
No need to be unpleasant.
My word, this Christ is beautiful!
- It was my father...
- What?
who restored it.
He was a connoisseur of art and antiques.
Now, then, Mr. Charrier on my right,
Renato here on my left.
Mrs. Charrier there, and the dear girl there, across from her mother.
Please.
These plates are quite unusual.
It's young men playing together, isn't it?
We have so many plates I can't keep track.
They're Greek youths.
I think they're Greek youths.
Oh, you're right.
Greeks on my plates - how strange!
Would you like to see it?
Just a minute.
I can't see a thing without my glasses, but they're all boys, aren't they?
There must be some girls somewhere.
Yes, I think I see one.
What a cute child!
She's right, of course.
There's a girl there.
Isn't that a girl?
You clearly haven't seen one lately.
These are boys.
It's easy to tell - they're naked!
Where are my glasses?
Here, hold it.
I'll be right back.
The idiot sets the table and doesn't even notice!
Give me the pot!
It's incredible.
I can never find them.
Now, what are these Greek youths doing?
Peasant soup Martinique-style.
Jacob's specialty.
I'm sorry, madame.
Jacob, continue serving.
Poor Mrs. Charrier has the Lord in her arms.
My apologies.
Nothing but problems today.
I'm sorry.
This way, please.
There are just two ways in - here or through the club.
Morin and Chauvet, wait in front.
We'll stay here.
Will you be staying on the Riviera a while?
No, I don't like to be away from my constituency.
- Your what?
- My constituency.
Besides, the ambiance of this area, the wantonness, the loose morals - it all turns my stomach.
Speaking of which... doesn't that club downstairs bother you?
A... uh... club?
Yes, that sort of nightclub.
La Cage aux Folles.
Ah, la Cage aux Folles.
Not really.
But it's the same building!
You share walls with those people?
Just the walls.
We don't fraternize with them.
Not at all.
It's another world.
But who owns the building?
We do.
You rent your basement to the owner of a nightclub?
Well... yes.
But we didn't know he owned a nightclub.
Of course not.
He's a man of few words.
He doesn't say much.
Just hello and good-bye.
He's not the type to tell you,
"I'm going to open up a nightclub in your basement."
Excuse me.
Perhaps we should discuss the wedding.
Laurent isn't here, but all the better.
Yes, parents should discuss these matters, even though the dears tend to ignore what we say.
My dear Mr. Charrier, what do you think of our children's decision?
I must say that at first I had my reservations.
But when my daughter told me about how upstanding and respectable your family was -
When your daughter told you...?
It put my mind at ease.
I felt that Andrea was too young to get married, and your son as well.
But since they're in love and won't listen to reason, and since they chose each other -
Since they chose each other...?
Well, I must admit that at first... we too were somewhat opposed to this marriage.
Especially me.
It's always hard on a mother when her son leaves her for another woman.
You'll say, "But that's life."
Of course it is.
We all know our children will leave us someday.
Still, it's hard to bear.
Excuse us.
Come, darling.
Just a moment.
Please excuse me.
What's wrong?
Just look in the mirror!
So it slipped a bit.
No big deal.
- What were you thinking?
- They believe it.
All three were lovely to me.
I made a big impression.
Are you crazy?
We're gonna end up on our asses here!
Besides, I'm doing it for Laurent, not for you.
And it's working just fine.
Onstage, perhaps.
Look at your wrists and ankles.
You think that man didn't notice your hairy hands?
I have to get back, or they'll be wondering.
My wig!
Give me back my wig!
Give it back!
TWENTY YEARS OF HAPPINESS
They're not expecting this.
I'm sure it'll be a surprise!
Mr. Baldi, please.
Mr. Baldi lives upstairs, but you have to go around.
I'm Laurent's mother.
Come with me.
Happy anniversary to you
Where are their manners, leaving us alone like this?
And their son leaving so abruptly before the meal.
Perhaps he had something urgent to take care of.
And that woman's very strange.
I don't know what you think, but there's something about her...
I think she's nice.
Did someone knock?
Yes!
Where's that butler?
Who's there?
Laurent's mother is here, Mr. Baldi.
Laurent's mother?
It's me, Renato.
Open the door.
It's Laurent's mother.
Who's there?
Laurent's mother.
Mr. Baldi isn't here.
I don't have the key.
It's in the cupboard by the door.
What cupboard?
On the left.
You must be Mr. Charrier.
Simone Baldi.
Nice to meet you.
Your daughter's adorable, madame.
My compliments.
She's gorgeous.
I knew Laurent had taste, but not like this.
Mr. Baldi, just how many mothers does your son have?
Would you repeat the question?
I'm asking you:
How many mothers does your son have?
Just one.
Albin.
Nice to meet you.
Isn't he adorable?
La Cage aux Folles... belongs -
Dad, can I talk to you?
What was that story you gave me!
Cultural attaché!
Housewife!
That's enough now!
I tried to tell you, but I've been afraid of you for 18 years!
Simon!
Let's go.
That's right!
Let's get going!
No, I'm staying.
Then stay!
I no longer have a daughter!
Reporters!
That's the last straw!
A nice white wedding, huh?
In great splendor, with the pope's blessing!
That picture isn't worth shit.
What do you see?
Charrier on the other side of a door?
What good is that?
I can see the headlines in tomorrow's papers.
"The Sequel to President Berthier and His Whore -
Deputy Charrier at La Cage aux Folles."
Please look closely at this door.
There's no neon sign saying "La Cage aux Folles."
You can leave quietly.
The bastards blocked the door.
They're trying to force you to leave through the club.
The club?
Very clever.
- We'll call the police.
- No police!
A ladder!
Do you have a ladder?
Don't start that again!
I'm ruined!
Renato, the man's right.
And his poor wife too.
They're really in a fix.
It's a pleasure to see.
Looks like I'll have to save the day once again.
You want to get out of here, right?
No scandal, no publicity?
It's always a shock the first time.
You'll get used to it.
What a figure!
You're gorgeous!
- Simon, you look awful!
- I know!
White makes me look fat.
I wanted black!
He has charm.
That's all he needs.
Hurry.
There's no time to lose!
Mercedes, dance with her.
Come on, old girl.
Act natural.
Off you go, sugar.
To the hotel, quickly!
How much?
- What?
Don't you recognize me?
- But madame -
Who are you calling "madame"?
It's her.
She came.
I knew it.
I told you I didn't want her here.
She's the mother of my son.
It's only natural.
No, it's not natural!
Playing the model mother after all these years!
Well, if she stays,
I'm not staying for the luncheon.
- Please, Albin.
- I'll leave!
That's all there is to it.
- Please listen.
No, you listen!
I've had it!
You can explain to Laurent.
He loves me, so he'll understand that on his wedding day, his Auntie had to slink home all alone like a dog!
There are some things a person just can't bear!
Go and take a bow, darlings.
Well done, sweethearts.
And now the great, the wonderful Mercedes!
- 80,000 francs tonight.
- What on earth is she doing?
I'll go and get her.
M. Baldi?
You bastard!
M. Baldi!
She's got to come down now.
Mercedes has just gone on stage.
You take care of it.
I can't cope with this anymore.
I'm going to kill her.
It's going well tonight, M. Baldi.
- How much have we made?
- 12,000 more than yesterday.
Shall we do anything about the prince's bill?
- I said no more discounts.
Is it a big bill?
- About 5,000.
- How many of them are there?
- Two.
OK, the coffees are on the house this time.
- I couldn't move her.
- Be firm, for goodness' sake!
I was firm, but it's no use.
Tell Mercedes to do another four songs.
- Renato, this is very good.
- Very entertaining.
M. Baldi.
I'll get my bag.
I'm so sorry to bother you, but she won't get up.
- Were you having dinner?
- Yes.
She's on stage in ten minutes and she isn't made up.
- It's me, Zaza.
The doctor.
- I'm not presentable.
- Zaza.
- No!
- Zaza.
- No, listen...
Come on out, Zaza.
Come on out and let the doctor see Zaza.
No, I look hideous!
Just hideous!
Zaza, your fans are waiting for you, and my dinner is going cold.
Please be reasonable.
Doctor, I'm so miserable.
So miserable.
If you only knew...
No, it's a little bout of depression.
It'll pass.
I want to die, Doctor.
I want to die.
Were you having dinner?
Can you reheat it?
- Rabbit in mustard sauce?
- That reheats well.
That's good.
Here's what to do.
Reduce the sauce in a deep frying pan.
Make sure it's a copper pan.
I always tell my friends "Use a copper pan, otherwise..."
- Are you dying or cooking?
- Shut up!
Lt's your fault I'm in this state!
Look what you've turned me into.
A wreck.
A human wreck.
A rag!
A scrap!
When I think that before I met you, I had gorgeous shoulders.
Look at them now...
It's the same every night.
I recorded you yesterday.
Just watch him have fun while I suffer.
- Shall I play some more of the tape?
- I'll give him a shot.
- No, Doctor!
- And ask his understudy to do tonight.
No, no, I'll behave.
OK.
So you'll go down to work?
- Has he got any tranquilizers left?
- There should be one or two in the box.
Two tablets as usual after the show, hm?
- I'll be going.
- Goodbye, Doctor.
The season's just started.
What do I do if he gets ill?
Close the club?
Lt's nothing serious.
He's a little tired.
Be nice to him, humor him, and everything will be OK.
- Good night, M. Baldi.
- Good night.
And thanks again.
Do you know what time it is?
Do you want to ruin the business?
You're doing it on purpose.
Why are you powdering your thighs?
Nobody can see them on stage.
Indifference is such an awful thing, Renato.
I dieted for two months and you didn't even notice that I'd lost weight.
I've made myself ill for you with all these diet pills and diuretics, and for nothing - not one word of encouragement.
You don't see me.
You don't love me anymore.
The other day, I bought a little outfit.
I wore it for you:
No reaction.
Albin, I'll get ill if you carry on like this.
It's possible.
You don't love me anymore, Renato.
After all this time together, I'm just part of the furniture to you, not a queen of the theater.
- You're cheating on me, Renato.
- Here we go again.
- There's a man in your life.
I know it.
- No, there's no man.
But there are 250 people waiting for the diva to take the stage!
They came here for you, to applaud you, to applaud the great Zaza Napoli.
What do you get up to when I'm on stage?
Where do you go while I'm killing myself on stage?
Go on, then.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Well?
Don't worry.
It'll be all right, my little lamb.
It doesn't hurt anymore.
It's nothing.
- Did you hurt your little fists?
- No.
Come on, hurry up.
- Do you still love me?
Tell me.
- Of course.
Hurry up.
- What's the matter?
- My fan!
- Go on.
Jacob will bring it down.
- My fan!
I can't sing without my fan!
- Jacob!
Bring Zaza's fan on the tray.
- My fan!
- Good evening, sweeties.
- Evening, Zaza.
No, that's enough.
Go on.
Quieten down, you lot!
Announce the next act.
Albin, please stop eating those chocolates.
Zaza!
Zaza!
Zaza!
I'm sick of your girl.
We're all slaves to that whore!
- Calm down.
Your colleague is working.
- Why did she come down?
- I could have been the last act.
- That's enough!
So is it four songs or eight songs?
I did eight songs tonight.
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- Sort it out now.
I don't want to be at the mercy of madame's whims.
That lazy pig...
Don't talk about Albin like that.
- And from tomorrow, no drag.
- Oh, no.
Please, not that.
I told you, no more drag.
You were asking for it, Henri.
- My fan!
Shit!
- Coming up.
Jacob!
I told you not to prance around the house naked.
Don't you like it?
Why won't you let me dance?
Watch.
- What do the others have that I don't?
- You have something they don't have.
You can cook.
Come on, hurry up.
I need you.
How did I end up with a maid like that?
!
This isn't happening.
Can I see you for a moment?
Lt's half past.
I've got an appointment.
Let me have some peace.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Pétunia.
What story have you got for me this time?
- I'm expecting a baby.
- What?
- I'm expecting a baby.
- You've got your wife pregnant again?
- Yes.
- But this will be your seventh.
Yes.
How do you expect to pursue a career?
Come and look at yourself in the mirror.
Look.
Procreation is tiring you out.
Can't you see you're aging by the day?
You're right.
Very well.
I'll speak to the accountant.
You'll get maternity pay.
- Thank you!
- It's OK.
Go back to work.
- You're kind, Renato.
- You cost me a lot of money, you know.
Jacob, take that wig off, or I'll tell Albin that you wear her wigs.
And I'll tell her you have romantic dinners while she's at work.
Get out of my way.
Get back in the kitchen, you idiot.
Come here.
You get more handsome every day.
Do I get a drink?
- Whisky?
Champagne?
- Champagne.
- Is he on stage?
- Yes.
For another two hours.
- It's OK, we won't be disturbed.
- What about Jacob?
I gave him the night off.
It's just the two of us.
You're looking good, too.
Not really.
I'm all bloated.
It's work.
I work too much, I get upset and I bloat.
- Do you really think I look good?
- Fantastic.
You're too kind.
Well, I suppose my body's still acceptable.
- I've got something important to tell you.
- Yes?
This isn't easy.
I'm getting married.
No.
I wanted to write to you, but, you know, in a letter...
She's great.
I'm sure you'll like her.
Are you annoyed?
No, not at all.
I'm very happy.
I'd always hoped you wouldn't, that you'd fall in love with a girl.
So I should be very happy.
No, that's fine.
I raise a boy for 20 years - my son - then a girl arrives and steals him away.
A bitch.
A bitch.
Yes, a bitch.
- Dad...
- Sorry.
Listen to me, Laurent.
If you marry her, you'll never set foot in here again.
I won't give you another penny.
I won't see you again.
Choose.
Goodbye, Dad.
You little idiot.
Come here!
Come on.
Let's celebrate this disaster.
- Did you really think that would work?
- No, but it was worth a try.
Let the celebrations begin!
You have to raise your glass to a wedding.
Long live the bride!
- What's the bitch called?
- Dad, please!
- Sorry.
What's this young lady called?
- Andréa.
So you've been living with a boy in Paris for a year and you're only telling us now?
Answer me.
Answer me!
You're frightening her, Simon.
Don't be so abrupt.
Mother, it's all right.
He's a nice boy, Father.
Very responsible.
It was him that brought up the subject of marriage.
What do his parents do?
Hello!
One moment.
It's for you.
Yes, hello?
Yes.
I've spoken to them.
What about you?
Yeah, I did, too.
He's delighted.
Bitch!
He got the champagne out.
We're celebrating.
Yeah, I've got a glass in my hand.
Listen.
To our love, Andréa.
I'll put him on.
Dad.
- Dad!
- No.
No!
Hello?
I'm drinking to your happiness, Andréa.
Shit!
Sorry
- I just broke my glass.
It's OK.
It was clear glass.
It brings good luck.
Here.
A bitch!
The girl's a bitch.
Your dad's nice.
Listen, I'm with my parents.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
No, it's nothing.
Don't worry.
Me too.
Bye.
Everything went well.
I'm glad.
Did you notice how clear the line was?
As if he were calling from the next room.
It was really clear, wasn't it?
Well, I...
It's late.
I'm going up.
Good night.
Andréa, we asked you what this young man's parents did.
His... his parents?
Nothing.
I mean, they're on holiday at the seaside.
But they can't be on holiday all the time.
No.
- So what does his father do?
- His father, he...
- He works in the arts.
- The arts?
I mean, kind of cultural work.
That's it.
He's the cultural attaché, that's it.
Cultural attaché at the Italian embassy.
- Good!
He's a diplomat!
- A diplomat.
That's nice.
Why didn't you tell us right away?
- Does his mother work?
- His mother?
No, his mother takes care of the children.
There are so many of them.
Hello!
Hello!
- Hello, M. Albin.
- Hi, M. Lefèvre.
The boy's home.
- How about a nice roast?
- I'll pick it up later.
OK.
- Hello, M. Albin.
- Some fresh pasta and Parmesan.
- So the boy's home?
- Yes, he's home.
I have to hurry.
- Hello, M. Lafargue!
- Hello, M. Albin.
The usual?
- Yes, a cake.
On top, I want you to write...
- "To my Lolo.
From Auntie."
"To my Lolo.
From Auntie."
Thanks for the bread.
I've got to run.
- Shall I deliver the cake?
- No, don't bother.
Jacob will pick it up.
Can I take a chocolate?
Thanks.
Bye.
Jacob!
Who did I see here this morning?
Who did I see here?
The little white master!
Your coffee is really disgusting.
You French make crap coffee.
You've called me Negro, you've called me queer, but you've never called me French.
Coo-eee!
Lt's the grocer!
- Hello, you.
- Hello, mistress.
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well, mistress.
Take care with the groceries.
The strawberries are underneath.
Don't forget to pick up the cake from Lafargue at midday.
Hello, you.
Goodness, you're all stubbly.
Is he still asleep?
I peeked in a moment ago.
Isn't he handsome!
You could have told me that Laurent was coming.
Then we wouldn't have had a scene.
The truth is that you can't stand sharing your son.
So you hide him away from me.
You ignore me.
You push me away.
I'm so hungry!
You're in a huff.
What's the matter?
Huh?
He's getting married.
- What?
- My son is getting married.
You're such a wag.
I bought sole for him.
He loves sole.
I do, too.
I wanted crayfish, but they were so expensive, so I decided on sole.
But it's strange you said that because last week I dreamt that the boy was getting married.
We were all at church.
We were crying and crying.
It...
It's not true, is it, Renato?
Some girl he met at university.
It was bound to happen.
A girl!
How awful.
Poor young chap.
He's too... too young.
He's still a child.
He'll ruin his life.
I told him that.
Of course I did.
But it's no use.
He thinks he'll be happy.
Maybe he will.
Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it.
You know, it hurts at first.
I wasn't expecting that.
I was feeling fine.
Now, all of a sudden, I feel sick.
It'll pass.
The bitch!
The woman's a bitch!
I see you've told him.
Come here, you fool!
- So, does your auntie get a kiss?
- Hi, Binbin.
He's being taken from us, Renato, and we won't have any others.
Unless there's a miracle.
I've given this marriage a lot of thought, Simon.
Mlle Corre, in the leader's speech, replace the word "scum" with "lout."
"Lout."
Can you see Mme Simonot's face if we marry a diplomat's son?
No, Mlle Corre, instead of "lout", put "degenerate."
"Degenerate."
When you think of where you came from, this is quite a match.
- After all, you're a policeman's son.
- Oh, no.
Come on!
Don't start that again, Louise.
I'm sick of hearing "policeman's son"!
I'm sick of all this!
Do you hear me?
Look what you made me do!
Andréa is too young to get married.
I'm not going over all that again.
Hello?
Speaking.
No!
My goodness.
My goodness.
Oh là là.
Oh là là.
Oh là là.
- What's happened, Simon?
- Our leader, Berthier, has died.
Berthier!
Oh, my goodness!
In the arms of a woman.
- A prostitute.
- In the arms of a p...
- An underage prostitute.
- No!
- Underage and black.
- I'm sorry?
An underage black prostitute.
Oh là là.
My career is ruined.
Why, Simon?
Lt's not your fault.
Listen to me, Simon.
You're not responsible for M. Berthier's private life.
Louise, I am the secretary-general of a party called the Union for Moral Order.
Our party leader has just died in the arms of a prostitute.
Wait till the press gets wind of this.
I fancy a little piece of chocolate.
Oh, no!
They put "From Uncle."
Lt's not "From Uncle." I told them, "From Auntie."
"To my Lolo.
From Auntie." He hasn't got an uncle.
It's "Auntie."
That smells good.
Feeling better?
He'll come and visit us.
He'll come and visit us with the girl.
We'll have to do something about the bedroom.
It's a bit small for a couple.
And there'll be grandchildren, hm?
Come on, look at me.
I can just see you.
I can just see you as a grandfather.
Pushing the pram, wearing your bracelets.
- Shall I break an egg for you?
- Leave me alone, please.
- I'm the king in the kitchen.
- The kitchen is your kingdom?
Yes.
Yours is the stage, and I rule in here.
Fair enough.
I'd better get on stage, then.
Go on, then.
Don't stop!
Go round the back.
M. Charrier isn't here.
No, he won't be back for lunch.
It hasn't stopped this morning.
Your father isn't back yet.
Mother.
I...
I...
- I have something to tell you.
- Yes?
Well...
It's about Laurent's parents.
Don't worry.
We'll talk about it to your father.
- No, please, Mother, we mustn't do that.
- Yes, we must!
You're in for a surprise.
- What are you doing there?
- Have you seen what it's like out there?
- I used the ladder instead.
- It's dangerous.
- You could have fallen.
- I did fall.
So now you know what it's been like for me this morning.
I warn you, I'm leaving.
These journalists that keep calling and sniggering.
- I can't stand it anymore!
- But everybody's sniggering.
Everybody's cracking up.
Everybody's laughing out loud!
And who are they laughing at?
Who are they mocking?
Me!
Thanks to Berthier, the Moral Order has become one big joke!
So thank you, party leader!
Thank you, you dirty old pig!
There is a solution, Simon.
A big white wedding.
- What?
- As soon as possible.
To restore your distinguished image.
Morality, family, tradition.
Your daughter marries the son of a diplomat.
M. Berthier and the prostitute are forgotten.
Marry off Andréa, and ask for the Pope's blessing if need be.
Listen, Louise.
I'm completely done for.
If you go on like this, I'll crack.
You have to marry her off, with pomp and ceremony.
Then you'll be the personification of tradition once more.
Where do this young man's parents live?
I won't do just anything.
I'm a professional!
Use amateurs if you want, but don't let them bother the real artists!
Just watch what Salomé does while I dance.
- Play the tape, Francis.
- You've always made me work hard!
Rehearsing in costume, under the lights.
The others don't have to.
It's not fair!
Come here, dear.
I want Renato to take you through The Queen of Broadway.
You're doing any old thing now...
- Dad, I need to talk to you.
- Just a minute.
Being 20 and having a six-pack does not make you talented, sweetie.
- Dad, it's important.
- Wait a minute.
He's rehearsing.
Stop!
- Did you see what he did?
- No, I was talking to Laurent.
- He was blowing bubbles.
- He wasn't!
He was blowing bubbles while I was singing!
He shouldn't be blowing bubbles.
Why are you blowing bubbles?
He's right.
Blowing bubbles is annoying.
It may be a transvestite show, but it still involves serious drama.
You must concentrate and think about your character.
Are you familiar with your character?
He's magnificent.
He's walking along Broadway.
He's very masculine.
Suddenly, he sees this wonderful apparition.
You look at her and you feel a kind of sexual ache in your groin...
Like that.
You do it.
It's a little exaggerated for a sexual ache.
- Dad.
- What now?
I'll be back in a minute.
Carry on without me.
- Can I talk to you?
- What is it?
Let's go upstairs.
Andréa's coming with her parents.
- So?
- They want to meet you.
You disturbed me to tell me that?
She said you were a cultural attaché and Albin a housewife.
- She's out of her mind.
- Remember my first day at school?
- No.
- I remember it well.
You told me to tell them you were a shopkeeper.
So?
I imagine your friend's father is rather more broad-minded than your teacher.
No.
Less broad-minded.
Charrier.
The MP.
The Moral Order.
Does that ring a bell?
So she told them you were a cultural attaché and Albin was a housewife.
So what do I do?
Sell La Cage aux Folles, study politics and become a diplomat?
What about Albin?
Snip!
You want him to have the operation?
Lf her father finds out she's lied, it's over.
It'd be nice if you could help us.
How?
First, send Albin away for a few days.
Albin?
You try and send Albin away.
And we'll have to get rid of some things here.
- For example?
- That.
And, well, I don't know...
- And that.
- The Greek statue?
Why?
And that, too.
- Is that it?
- I don't know...
Try and make it a little less fussy, a little more stark.
- You know what I mean?
- You mean redecorate it.
A dream home photographed by Homes and Gardens.
Listen, we're changing nothing.
Have you got that?
- You'll have to make a little effort, too.
- Why?
Try not to show you're that way inclined.
- It's not obvious, is it?
- Dad.
Laurent.
It was only painted a month ago.
Come in!
Sir, Albin is hitting Salomé and trying to take his chewing gum.
Yes, I use foundation.
Yes, I live with a man.
Yes, I'm an old queen.
But I'm at ease with myself.
It's taken me 20 years, and I won't let your bloody MP destroy it all.
I don't give a damn about your MP!
To hell with your MP!
Are you going on holiday?
Saint-Tropez.
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to see them.
- Use the door.
Speak to them.
- No!
Leave me alone.
You have to announce the news.
We agreed.
- You do it.
It was your idea.
- Oh, Simon!
I'm going down.
Tell the chauffeur to come round.
- Are you leaving us?
- Are you going to Berthier's funeral?
What do you think the future holds for the Union for Moral Order?
I have one thing to say to you.
I'm going away for a few days to organize an event which perfectly epitomizes the spirit of our movement.
Oh là là là là!
The little white master is in a bad mood!
He told me I dressed like a whore.
He's right.
From this evening you'll dress normally, like a real butler.
Take this and the painting to the cellar.
Get rid of all these tacky knick-knacks, these cushions.
Get rid of it all.
Especially this.
Take it to the cellar.
Don't bother.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Laurent, stop pestering me.
I've got to talk to poor Albin now.
It's making me feel nauseous.
What am I going to say to him?
What shall I say?
Huh?
"Get out, you fat cow"?
"Clear off, you old faggot"?
I don't think you have to put it like that.
- Are you OK?
- It's hot.
- You shouldn't be out in the sun.
- It's nice.
No, it's not.
You shouldn't be out in the sun in your condition.
- What do you mean?
- Did you look in the mirror this morning?
- What's wrong with me?
- You look pale.
- I'm suntanned.
- Yes.
Yes, you're pale brown.
That's what's worrying me.
I think you need a holiday.
Why do I need a holiday?
I feel great.
OK.
Forget I said anything.
Renato, you're scaring me.
Has someone said something?
- Did Dr Deslandes tell you something?
- No, no, he didn't tell me anything.
No.
I was just thinking that as you're a bit touchy, a bit depressed even, maybe a few days' holiday would do you good.
Renato, darling, I may not be very bright, but when you spell things out,
I catch on eventually.
You're trying to get rid of me.
I'm not a child anymore.
I know all the tricks now.
And you're up to no good, Renato.
No good.
And it's degrading.
- Do you know what date it is?
- No.
- The 25th of June.
- Ah!
"Ah." as you say.
Our anniversary.
20 years together.
That's nice!
You picked this day to lie to me so shamelessly, to deceive me.
- Albin, do you want Laurent to be happy?
- What's that got to do with it?
Lf you want Laurent to be happy, you have to go away.
- Jacob!
- Did the little white master call me?
Stop being a jerk and take the Greek statue out.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
Get a move on.
You're casting me aside!
You're banishing me like a leper!
You're ashamed of me!
I've spent nights at the boy's bedside.
I've sacrificed my life for him.
- Albin, listen to me.
- No!
You listen to me, Renato.
Either I stay here where I belong, to meet these people, or I never set foot in here again.
What's happened?
Laurent, you could have waited a bit.
It doesn't matter.
I understand.
You're sending me away.
You're driving me out of my home.
It doesn't matter.
I'm going.
I'm leaving you.
The ogre...
The ogre is leaving.
Are you happy now?
Come on.
Come on.
Come inside.
- Come and cry inside.
- No!
Albin!
Albin!
Albin, stop being so stupid!
I don't want to see you anymore.
I hate you.
It's OK.
You can stay.
I don't feel very well at all.
All this upset.
It's too much for me.
I'm in such a state.
Feel my pulse.
It's all over.
- Come on.
We'll go to Marcel's.
- It's all over.
All over.
You're just a little weak.
You haven't eaten all day.
Come on, sit down.
- Hello, Renato.
Hello, Albin.
- Hi, Marcel.
Two teas and some crackers.
- Is he all right?
- He's just a bit tired.
- Why don't you have a lie-down?
- He'll be fine after a cup of tea.
Salt-free crackers, please!
What are we going to do about tonight?
Lt's difficult.
What are we going to tell them?
Two men like us?
You're sweet.
That feels good on my neck.
Couldn't I be a relative?
No?
Maybe his uncle?
Couldn't you say I was his uncle?
Oh, all right.
I know I don't look like an uncle.
But you're not home and dry either, you know.
- He said you were a cultural attaché.
- Yes.
So?
A cultural attaché.
As if!
Oh là là!
We're not out of the woods yet.
Here's your tea and crackers.
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.
Oh là là.
Cultural attaché!
You have a unique way of eating.
Rather like a mechanical digger.
Your finger.
What's it doing up in the air?
Just look at it.
- So?
Lt's got a mind of its own.
- Really?
Tell the MP that tonight.
Let's start to make a man out of this uncle.
Let's try, huh?
Learn how a man holds a cracker.
Hold it like this.
Watch.
Spread the butter with vigor.
And watch your little finger when you drink your tea.
Go on!
- And sit up straight...
- Oh, no!
What now?
Please stop whining when I try to correct you.
It's for your own good.
- I want you to be presentable tonight.
- Of course.
Right.
Let's take the cracker and some butter.
Like a man.
Don't be afraid to press.
That's it.
Good.
You're doing it on purpose.
You've got it in for me.
- It's all right.
Take another one.
- I'll never get it.
Never.
You're whining again.
That's enough.
Hold the cracker firmly in your little hand.
Steadily and confidently.
- An iron fist in a velvet glove.
- OK.
- That's right.
A man's cracker.
- OK.
- Now for something harder.
- A little jam?
- Yes.
Take a spoon.
- The teaspoon?
No!
Not like that.
What are you doing?
Lt looks like you're ringing a little bell.
It's just a spoon.
- Hold it without quivering, firmly!
- All right!
Lf you're trying to kill me, aim for the eyes.
It's a sure hit.
I'll never get it.
- I broke my cracker.
- Fine.
You broke your cracker.
It's a disaster.
The important thing is to know how to respond as a man.
Get it?
Yes.
Yes, you're right.
You have to say to yourself, calmly, "Albin, you broke it."
"But there's no harm done.
It's not the end of the world."
- Try again.
Take another cracker.
- Yes, you're right.
There's no harm done.
After all, there are more crackers.
For a moment...
- Be careful with your little finger.
- It's got a mind of its own.
That's enough.
Blow.
That's it.
- We're going home.
- Wait a minute.
I'm going to freshen up.
- No, no, no!
- What did I do?
- What kind of walk is that?
- What's the matter with it?
Mince like that tonight and we're done for.
- What am I going to do?
- Come here.
- What?
- Try and walk like John Wayne.
- The cowboy?
- Yes.
John Wayne.
Get off your horse, walk towards the saloon, send the doors flying, and pow!
- Give it a go.
- John Wayne?
That's Miss John Wayne.
You poof!
Someone called me a poof.
Now he'll show you.
Did you call my friend a poof?
The swelling's gone down a bit.
It's nothing.
You were marvelous, wonderful.
I'm proud of you.
The big guy looked so stupid when he sat on you and banged your head on the floor.
I felt sorry for him.
A beast who didn't know how to fight.
Poor chap.
No, leave it.
I'll go and get some ice.
I'll be right back, sweetheart.
I've got some bad news for you.
- I gave in.
I told him he could stay.
- Why?
Because I thought I'd have to bring him home on a stretcher.
Because he's my partner.
Besides, he's got an 80 percent stake in the club.
- How are you going to introduce him?
- As your uncle.
- That's it, then.
I've had it.
- You're so touchy!
You're being rude.
Can't we even discuss it?
Of course, it would be better if we had a woman here.
Funny, isn't it?
For once, we need a woman here.
Why don't we simply ask your mother?
- No way!
- Why?
She abandoned me 20 years ago.
I won't ask her for a thing.
You're not making this any easier.
Very well.
I'll take care of it...
I'll take care of it.
Are you serious?
You can't go and see that woman after what she did to us.
- You're out of your mind, Renato.
- Why?
Excuse me.
Mme Deblon, please.
Ask at the office.
- Come in.
- May I see Mme Deblon?
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.
Just tell her it's Renato Baldi.
If you don't have an appointment, I doubt she'll see you.
Mme Deblon is very busy.
Try, please.
It's urgent.
I won't keep her long.
Renato Baldi.
Wait in the foyer.
The director will see you.
- I'll come with you.
- No, please don't.
I won't leave you alone with her.
I know what she's capable of.
- The director is waiting for you.
- I'm coming.
It's you I love.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Renato Baldi.
My dear madam.
This is a real surprise.
Have a seat.
I never drink in the morning, but today...
To what do I owe this pleasure?
Laurent.
- Nothing serious, I hope?
- Actually, it is.
He's getting married.
Already?
How old is he, for heaven's sake?
How old?
Old enough.
It's almost 20 years since you saw the boy.
I know.
Have you come here to scold me?
No, don't think that.
But today, for the first time ever, he needs you.
No problem.
I'll cancel my appointments and I'm all yours tonight.
- Thank you.
- It's a pleasure.
I haven't done much for that child in 20 years.
- I often feel bad about it.
- You shouldn't.
I'm not very maternal.
I am.
That's true.
He's lucky.
OK.
What time this evening?
Eight o'clock.
We'll put on our one-act play, then send them back to the country and relax.
- Do you remember the revue?
- Yes, I remember.
You were so handsome.
I'd never seen such a body.
I get embarrassed when you talk like that.
- Remember how afraid you were?
- I thought I was going to have a coronary!
I went into the room, and what did I find in the bed?
A woman.
I gave the doorman 50 francs.
50 francs, in those days!
I was so tipsy.
Otherwise, I would never have dared to say to myself
"Why not?
You've got to try everything once."
I'd heard so much about it.
What did I have to lose?
So I took the plunge.
How long did we last?
I can tell you exactly.
From 2:30 until 3:45.
Twice.
It's warm in here.
- You haven't changed, you know.
- No?
You've put on a little weight.
It suits you.
You're all man.
What's all this hair?
You didn't have any when I met you.
- I shaved it off for the stage.
- He shaved it off.
Yes.
- He used to shave it.
And now?
- Be careful, Simone.
- I love hairy chests.
- Be careful.
Careful, it's a crepe shirt.
With those nails of yours, you're going to...
Look!
Look, you've snagged it.
What does that red light mean?
That the director should not be disturbed for any reason.
Albin!
Thank you.
Have you got my glasses?
Where are my glasses?
Here it is.
"M. Berthier's death." There's nothing much about it.
There's nothing.
Splendid.
"Exemplary career..."
"Heart attack..."
Nothing else.
Splendid.
Nothing at all.
Very good.
Sometimes it's useful to have friends who are journalists.
I knew it!
I just knew it!
What drivel!
Two columns!
"The ecstatic death of M. Berthier." Filthy rats!
- Calm down.
- Just listen to this.
"Lt seems that the last words uttered by Berthier were 'Don't forget my little gift."'
The rotten swines!
Rotten swines!
The swines!
Forget all this filth, Simon.
Think of the reason for this trip.
I borrowed it from the antique dealer.
I've got to return it tomorrow.
I've refurnished the living room, too.
I hope your friends appreciate it.
What's going on?
Thank you, Jacob.
I would have liked to have known your children.
Don't leave, mistress!
My good Jacob.
What is this?
Uncle Tom's Cabin?
I know...
I know what you're thinking.
I'm a laughing stock.
Not just in the club.
Out in the street, too.
Everywhere.
I know I'm ridiculous.
There's only one place where people aren't ridiculed.
That's where I'm going.
Farewell, Renato.
Mistress, don't go!
I'm leaving you my hi-fi, my red boots and my wigs.
Where are you going?
Where?
- To Foissy.
- Foissy?
There's nothing but a cemetery there.
That's why I'm taking as little as possible.
You're taking a toothbrush to your tomb?
- Farewell, Renato.
- Mistress!
- That's enough, Jacob.
- I'm praying, master.
You know my cemetery is in Lombardy.
It's the prettiest cemetery in the world.
It's full of trees.
The sky is blue.
There are birds.
Compared to that, Foissy is shit.
In Foissy, they bury the dead in shit.
Forgive me for saying this, but you're a bitter old pain in the neck.
It's true that you don't excite anyone anymore.
You're a parody.
Everyone laughs at you.
But I'm still with you because you make me laugh.
So do you know what I'm going to do?
Sell my burial plot in Lombardy and lie beside you in the shit at Foissy, so I can keep on laughing.
Every time you're alone with that woman, it's the same.
It's only the second time in 20 years.
Exactly!
Can you imagine having a second child at your age?
You'd be on your own this time, girl.
Really!
I couldn't go through motherhood a second time.
What's so funny?
I feel like strangling you again.
- Dad.
- Yes?
Can I talk to you a moment?
I know you're having problems right now, and... and the press will be watching us for a few days still.
I wanted to tell you that
- the people we're going to meet...
- Just a moment.
- Waiter!
- Coming, sir.
Sir?
- Your meat is past its best.
- We'll change it right away.
No!
I'm not waiting for you to prepare another one.
But it's outrageous that a restaurant of this standing serves rotten meat.
If you don't want me to change it, what can I do, sir?
What I'm going to do is write to Michelin.
I'd be very surprised if you keep your stars.
You can go now.
Very good, Simon.
You were saying, the people we're going to meet...
Nothing.
It doesn't matter.
Very good.
Brilliant!
The butler.
Jacob!
Aren't you forgetting something?
I can't wear shoes.
I've never worn them.
They make me fall over.
Go on!
Go off and put some shoes on.
And speak in your normal voice.
This is a real black man's voice, like the little white master requested.
- Get out of my sight!
- Great, Dad.
Do you think so?
You know, this reminds me of my grandfather.
He dressed just like this.
He committed suicide when he was 30.
And remember, Dad, as few gestures as possible.
Don't walk around.
Don't speak.
- In short, do as little as possible.
- As little as possible.
No good?
I dressed the same as you.
I took all my rings off.
I've...
I've got no make-up on.
And your feet?
Obviously, there's still a hint of color.
OK.
You're right.
I look even more outrageous like this.
Is that what you were thinking?
I was.
Very well.
I'll go.
I'll be off.
I wanted so much to help you, sweetheart.
Right, then.
- Hello?
- May I speak to M. Baldi?
- Who's speaking, please?
- Simone Deblon.
It's my mother.
- M. Baldi isn't here.
- Who is this?
Is it Laurent?
Laurent, I want you to know that since I saw your father, I've been doing some thinking.
You may well say it's a bit late.
Laurent, listen.
I think your father's right.
You'll be better off with a woman.
So, I'm at a petrol station, on the way to your place.
If you still want me, I'll be there.
Come over.
What do you mean, "come over"?
Are you out of your mind?
- It'll be better with her.
- What about him?
Do you know what he'll do if Simone sets foot in here?
!
He said he wanted to help me.
He'll be cool about it.
Come on.
Relax!
Lt'll be fine.
Here.
Touch it.
Touch it now.
The dealer that lent you is a con merchant, but if all goes well,
I'll buy you and use you instead of the charm.
I'll give it to you now.
Here you are.
Jacob!
Have you got your shoes on?
Go and let them in.
- Laurent.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Delighted to meet you.
Please, come in.
- Thank you.
My father.
- Pleased to meet you.
- My daughter.
Delighted to meet you.
- My husband.
- It's an honor to meet you.
My mother is sorry, but she'll be late.
She's visiting my brothers and sisters.
They're at my grandparents'.
Yes.
Andréa told us you have a large family, M. Baldi.
Quite large.
How many brothers and sisters does Laurent have?
- Six.
- Six.
- Six.
- We don't have enough children today.
Our movement is very concerned by this drop in birth rate.
May I congratulate you?
A family like yours should be held up as an example.
Please sit down.
One, two, three.
- Hello?
- This is Charrier's chauffeur.
Hold the line.
- It's Charrier's chauffeur.
- Yes?
What is it?
They're with the owners of La Cage aux Folles.
- What?
Are you sure?
- Yes.
I dropped them off there.
Call Toulon and get me Moreau.
Now!
Charrier at the Folles!
Lt's too good to be true!
Did you have a good trip?
Very good.
Splendid weather.
The roads were good.
We spent the night near Lyon, at my friend, Bouchard's.
I first met him in the army.
I met up with him again a few years later in the hotel business.
He... he inherited the hotel from his father.
He's turned it into a modern, comfortable hotel.
Comfortable.
Very pleasant.
It was nice.
It was nice.
It was a pleasant place to break the journey.
Hm?
Lt was... it was pleasant...
I like the austerity of this place.
Actually, for my father, this house is more a place for work and contemplation than a real holiday home.
A monastery.
I'm very sensitive to my surroundings.
When I visit someone, I can immediately tell what they're like.
I'm happy to say that I feel very comfortable here.
Very comfortable.
You've won my husband over, M. Baldi.
It's not often he pays such a compliment.
I must confess that, although I hold a public office, I'm rather...
Would you prefer something other than champagne?
Port or whisky, perhaps?
- Madame?
- No, no.
Just some water, please.
I don't usually drink, but I think I'll make an exception today.
Watch what you're doing, you idiot!
No harm done!
Champagne brings good luck.
Thanks, Jacob.
We'll pour it ourselves.
- Can I help?
- Yes.
Jacob's very sweet, but he's not up to serving yet, is he?
Lt's difficult finding domestic staff nowadays.
Oh, yes.
If you knew how many chauffeurs I've had this year!
Lt must be worse for you, with all the traveling you do as a diplomat.
Here we are.
It's me.
Mother.
Please forgive me.
I'm so sorry, but this traffic!
These hold-ups are really...
It's getting impossible.
Good evening, sir.
I'm so thrilled to meet you.
The father of that naughty girl who stole my boy from me.
Naughty girl!
Excuse me.
Hello, my dear, hello.
I'm only joking.
I like the dear girl already.
She's adorable.
Well?
Do I get a kiss?
Does Mother get a kiss?
Come here, sweetheart.
I like her already.
She's a darling.
She's bound to be intimidated.
Come here.
Do I frighten you?
What a treasure!
Isn't she a darling?
My little girl.
Have you got a cigarette?
Try and stop your mother.
Explain the situation.
Thank you.
- Please excuse me a moment.
- Where's he going?
Dinner is served!
- Jacob!
What's come over you?
- Nothing.
Nothing at all.
- Servants are such a problem!
- We were just saying that.
It's almost impossible to get decent staff these days.
You're telling me!
You've no idea how many maids we've been through.
Each one as clumsy as the next.
They're not disobedient, just inept.
I could name half a dozen!
- Roger, Marcel, Lucien, André, Michel...
- Dinner.
- What?
- Dinner!
All right!
No need to be nasty.
Oh, I say!
- This crucifix is beautiful.
- Yes, it's my father.
- Pardon?
- My father restored it.
My father was a connoisseur.
He loved art and bric-a-brac.
Here we are.
M. Charrier to my right.
Renato here.
Mme Charrier.
And the little darling, opposite her mother.
Please sit down.
These plates are unusual.
It's young people playing together, isn't it?
We have so many plates, I've no idea which ones they are.
They're Greeks.
I think they're Greeks.
Indeed, they are Greeks - Greeks on my plates.
How strange.
- You want to see it?
- Yes, please.
I can't see a thing without my glasses.
They're young boys.
Yes, young boys.
You've got boys on your plate?
There aren't any girls?
Of course.
I think I saw one.
What a treasure she is!
She's right, of course.
Look, there's a girl just there.
That's a girl, isn't it?
Lt's a long time since you've seen them.
Because these are boys.
You can tell they are!
They're naked.
Where are my glasses?
Hold it a moment.
I'll be right back.
Idiot!
You set the table and didn't even notice!
Give me the pan!
Lt's amazing.
I can never find them.
Let's see what the Greeks are doing.
Caribbean soup.
Jacob's specialty.
- M. Baldi!
- I'm sorry, dear.
Jacob, continue serving, please.
Poor Mme Charrier has the Lord in her arms.
Forgive me, dear.
It's one of those days.
I'm so sorry.
There we go.
Over here, please.
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.
There are only two entrances.
Morin and Chauvet, wait outside the club.
We'll stay here.
Are you staying on the Riviera for long?
No, no.
I don't like leaving my constituency for too long.
- Your?
- My constituency.
I must confess the free and easy attitude and the loose morals of this area make my stomach turn.
Speaking of which, doesn't that nightclub downstairs bother you?
A night... nightclub?
Yes, that discotheque.
La...
- La Cage aux Folles.
- Oh, yes, La Cage aux Folles.
Oh, no.
You share a building with those people?
Only the walls.
We don't mix with them at all.
It's another world.
- But who owns the building?
- We do.
You rent your basement to a nightclub owner?
Yes.
Yes, we do.
Yes!
We didn't know that he ran a nightclub.
Of course we didn't know.
The man didn't speak much.
He was very reserved.
He just said hello and goodbye.
He wasn't the type to say "Hey,
I'm going to open a nightclub in your basement."
Excuse me.
Could we discuss the wedding perhaps?
Laurent isn't here, but...
These are things parents should discuss, even though our children take no notice of us nowadays.
So, M. Charrier, what do you think of our children's decision?
I was a little against it at first.
But when my daughter spoke so highly of your family, of its integrity...
Is that what your daughter said about our family?
Yes.
It... it reassured me a little.
I thought Andréa was too young to get married.
And your son, too.
But since they love each other and they've already made up their minds...
Since they've chosen each other...
Since they've chosen each other...
Well, I must admit that, to begin with, we were somewhat opposed to this marriage.
Especially me.
It's always very difficult for a mother when her son leaves her for another woman.
I know you'll say to me "That's life." Of course it is.
I know that sooner or later all children leave home.
That's our lot.
- Nevertheless, it's hard to bear...
- Excuse us a moment.
- Come with me, sweetheart.
- He wants to talk to me.
Excuse me a moment.
- What's the matter?
- Have you seen yourself?
Take a look in the mirror!
All right, it's slightly crooked.
- What were you thinking of?
- Renato, they believe it!
They were all charming towards me.
I think I made a big impression.
What are you talking about?
We'll end up in a mess.
Remember, I'm not doing this for you.
It's for Laurent.
And it's working very well.
On stage perhaps - not in real life.
Look at your hairy wrists.
When the MP kissed your hand, he must have noticed.
- They'll be wondering what's going on.
- Albin!
Albin!
Don't move!
I'm sorry.
- My wig!
- No.
- Renato, give me my wig back!
- No.
- Give me my wig back!
- No, no, no!
20 YEARS OF HAPPINESS
They're not expecting this.
It will be such a surprise!
- Yes, madame?
- M. Baldi, please.
He's upstairs, but you'll have to go round.
I'm Laurent's mother.
Come with me, madame.
?
Happy anniversary to you
?
Happy anniversary to you
What's going on?
Leaving us alone like this!
And their son left abruptly before the meal.
Maybe he had to run an urgent errand.
I don't know.
That woman is strange.
I don't know what you think...
When she speaks, there's something not quite right.
I think she's nice.
Didn't someone knock?
- Yes.
- Where's the butler?
- Who is it?
- It's Laurent's mother.
Laurent's mother?
It's me, Renato!
Open the door.
Laurent's mother?
- Who is it?
- Laurent's mother.
M. Baldi isn't here.
I don't have the key.
It's in the alcove by the door.
- He said the key is in the alcove.
Where...
- To the left.
You must be M. Charrier.
Simone Baldi.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Your daughter is adorable, Mme Charrier.
Congratulations.
She's beautiful.
I knew Laurent had good taste, but he's excelled himself.
M. Baldi, how many mothers does your son have?
Would you mind repeating the question?
I'm asking you how many mothers your son has.
Just one.
Albin.
Pleased to meet you, M. Charrier.
?
Happy anniversary to you
?
Happy anniversary to you
?
Happy anniversary to you
La Cage aux Folles.
It's La Cage aux Folles.
Dad, can I talk to you?
What kind of yarn did you spin?
!
Cultural attaché?
Housewife?
Now, that's enough!
I tried to tell you but I was afraid.
I've been afraid of you for 18 years!
- Simon!
- M. Charrier, please!
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go!
- No.
I'm staying here.
- Stay, then.
You are no longer my daughter.
Reporters.
Reporters.
That's the last straw.
A lovely white wedding?
Pomp and ceremony!
With the Pope's blessing!
Well done!
What are you gonna do with a shit photo like that?
What can you see, huh?
A door, with Charrier behind the door.
What use is that?
I can just see the headlines tomorrow.
"After M. Berthier and the whore, it's Charrier, MP, in La Cage aux Folles."
Have you considered that this door does not bear a neon sign saying "Cage aux Folles"?
You can leave peacefully...
- The bastards have blocked the door.
- Blocked it?
They're blocking this door to force you to go through the nightclub.
- Through the nightclub?
- Very cunning.
Through the nightclub?
This can't be!
- Call the police.
- No!
Not the police!
A ladder.
Have you got a ladder?
Don't start that again, Simon.
It's all over.
The man's right, Renato.
His poor wife, too.
They're both in a tight spot.
It's a pleasure to see.
Right!
I'm going to have to save the day once again.
You want to get out of here, am I right?
No scandal, no publicity.
Oh, no!
Lt's always shocking the first time.
No, you'll get used to it.
What a physique!
You're extraordinary!
- You look hideous, Simon.
- White makes me look fat.
I wanted black!
No, leave him alone.
He's got charm - that's all he needs.
Come on, hurry up!
Mercedes, dance.
Dance with her!
Come on, big boy.
Act naturally.
Go on.
Go on, doll!
The hotel!
Quickly!
The hotel!
- How much is it?
- What?
Lt's me!
- Madame...
- What do you mean, "Madame"?
Simon!
Simon!
Hello.
She's here.
She came.
I knew she would.
- I told you I didn't want that woman here.
- She is the mother of my son.
- It's only natural for her to be here.
- It's not natural!
Playing the model mother after all these years!
Lf she stays, I'm not staying for the reception.
I won't be here.
I shall leave!
- Please, Albin...
- I shall leave!
That's all there is to it.
- Please, Albin.
- Yeah, "please." I'm sick of all this!
And you can tell Laurent.
He'll understand because he loves me.
He'll understand why his auntie wasn't at the wedding.
He went home all alone, like a dog...
Some things are just too much to bear...

RAPlNG!
I have a flat Can I use your crowbar?
Sorry.
It seems to be mising from my truck.
Okay.
Let me find it.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
.
Don't touch me!
Help!
Help me!
.
Watch out!
Stupid!
No!
No.....
Don't touch me!
So all your stuff is here?
.
You're heading to Tokyo after spending time on vacation
Yes
Can I see your driver's license?
.
How are you doing?
.
Do you feel like telling the truth?
.
I already told you.
We met at the drive-in restaurant...
We fell in love at first sight.
Don't lie.
It's time to tell the real truth.
Look.
I don't have any money.
Why do you think I was selling my body for sex?
...
You are hiding it somewhere.
Eh?
...
Hey... you!
Look for it anywhere.
Eh?
.
What?
.
Do you know where you're at?
.
The police station!
- Where is it hidden?
.
-Go away.
Get dressed and leave...
Disrespect...
Detective... will you hook this for me?
.
Quit joking
You have no respect for the police.
Thank you.
Well..... bye bye now...
While driving through the woods you met the truck driver he chased you into the forest and caught you.
Yes
Then what did he do?
.
I don't remember.
It's impossible not to remember.
Were you wearing your underpants afterwards?
.
Did you remove them, or did he?
.
I wouldn't have done it.
Did he use his left or right hand to remove them?
.
I don't know.
Why don't you think about it carefully?
.
I really don't remember...
'cause I was scared and upset.
Really?
.
If such rapist truly exists...
We need your information to arrest him.
Did you say if?
.
He exists!
T ry one more time.
Yes.
After he took your underwear did he ejaculate?
.
Did you see his erection?
.
-I'm asking you.
- I don't know.
Was there foreplay involved?
.
Do you know about foreplay?
.
Did he use his fingers?
.
Did he use saliva?
...
Or not?
.
Did he rape you from the front or from the back?
...
Really..... in that type of case, we often discover..... despite the girl's claim.....
it was consensual sex.
We have to be careful.
Hey you!
Don't trust them.
They won't find him...
I may know the guy who raped you
I could take you to him.......
We could drag him to the cops
Then they can't doubt you.
Don't worry.
He'll be here...
He always hangs out here.
Do you have a cigarette?
...
I'm going to the restroom.
-May I take the plates?
.
- Yes.
Hey, why are you so dressed up?
.
Are you running away with some guy?
...
I'd run away with you.
Then let's run away for a couple of hours.
Jump in.
Are you feeling good, or what?
.
You get on me this time.
Don't you love it?
...
Make some sexy noises.
I said get on top of me
You're pulling my neck.
That hurts.
C'mon, make the aound.
Scream.
Car problems?
.
I can take a look at it...
My station is very close.
Jump in...
Come on.
Do you think you can fix it?
.
Will it be alright?
...
This opne is a bit involved.
I can do it tomorrow morning...
Are you worried about where to stay?
.
Stop...
Stop the car.
- It's a love hotel.....
-But there's nothing else here.
This way.
Please.
Here'a the key...
Enjoy your stay...
Get comfortable.
What about the guy?
.
She's by herself...
Oh?
...
That's rare...
Are you disappointed?
.
How about the other rooms?
.
She's the only guest tonight.
I was looking forward to this.
What a disappointment.
You can't have sex without watching?
...
THAT disappoints me.
Well..... well... don't make fun of me...
I'm still young.
-She's watching us.
- Eh?
.
What are you doing?
.
I'm showing off for her.
Impossible.
She can't see us.
-She's crying
- Yes.
Madam..... do you have a key?
.
Nasty boy.
Here.
Easy...
Easy.
Eh?
.
What are you doing here?
.
I just wonder why you're here by yourself...
Eh?
...
No!
...
Don't touch me.
No!
.
No!
.
Stop it!
No!
No!
...
-Please, can you open the hood?
.
- Yes
1 53,000?
... 1 53,000 yen?
.
Here's the breakdown.
I will send the rest from Tokyo...
Then I must keep your car.
You can't do that...
What are you doing?
.
Then...
You can drive your car, but.......
Let me out!
How's your business?
.
- So, so
-Yeah
-Okay, bye
- Yeah
Bye bye.
What happened to you?
.
You look awful.
I'm sorry for borrowing yopur stuff without telling you.
Why don't you change your clothes inside?
.
You're under bad luck.
Have you finished eating?
.
-Hey girl-Ah
-I haven't seen you for a while.
Are you doing OK?
.
Eh?
.
Do you have time?
.
Ok with me.
But what about her?
.
-Eh?
.
She's still a virgin.
Is that true?
...
She's very cute.
Hey....... do you want to take my place?
.
What do you mean?
.
Have a quickie with this gentleman.
You don't have any money...
I can't...
I'm not.....
I'm sorry.
She can't give up her virginity yet...
I'm so disappointed...
Then I have no other choice.
Bad attitude.
-Can you wait for me there?
.
-Sure, see you.....
Keep that.
I'll get some money right now.
See you later...
Wait a minute...
What's wrong?
.
Don't make me wait.
Not yet.
Patient.
Do it...
Quickly.
Sorry to scare you...
But you turned down a dead end road.
-Thank you very much.
-No problem.
What are you doing?
.
Don't touch me!
...
What happened to you?
.
Such a serious wound.
Right.
- Does it atill hurt?
.
- A little...
Then...
The pain will go away after some sleep.
Rest in the clinic for a while.
Be quiet.
Somebody help me!
.
Nobody's there... you must pay my fee
If you don't pay, I'll call the police.
Answer me...
Enough of your fabrications.
We have a signed complaint from the doctor...
You tried to run away without paying your bill.
That's not true.
How awful!
Really?
.
Then give me the details on how the doctor raped you.
Did the doctor do this?
.
And then, did he do this?
.
Your screaming does not help at all.
Nobody will come here.
Let me go!
Wait.
Don't panic.
We can't be obvious.
Damn it.
You again!
What's wrong with you?
...
When I don't catch any client for the night, I sleep here...
Come in.
You're atupid... if I were you, I'd have used this thing...
They would've been in trouble over it...
If you don't do anything or say anything....... people take advantage of you.
That's how the world is.
If you become like me, you've reached the end too
You say your car is in front of the clinic?
...
The cops will have it staked out.
Where are you going?
.
To work.
You need money to get out of here.
Hey...
Do you have a cigarette?
...
Here
- Mister..... you look new to me.
- What?
.
It's very late, so I can give you a special...
What do you mean?
.
You don't have to act naive.
Here.
You are under arrest for prostitution...
You've been a difficult case, but now you'll go to jail...
No business at all last night.
Sorry to be a bother.
No other choice.
You've got to get your car.
Cops will be there.
Give me the gun, I'll pretend I found it on the street.
Please take care of it...
Eat...
Let's do it.
Just as you requested...
Hey...
How about the girl?
.
She went to the back like I suggested.
-That's good.
By the way, can you really make the new guy back off?
.
Alright.
Alright.
Don't worry.
All right.
Let's cut her off...
Again.
Do it.
Slut!

And we will pick up a couple of birds.
I don't want to pick up a couple of birds.
Professor is right.
We don't want to pick up a couple of birds, we'd pick up three birds.
One each.
Now you two go on.
Why don't you want to come with us?
Well, I feel tired and wounded.
I think I'll just turn in for the night.

We better go to the disco.
Okay.
It's locked.
Hey, professor.
The house was very quiet, nothing could be heard.
Yet the old lady could almost feel a sense of heaving.
She listened, the silence was opressive.
Suddenly there was a knock at the window.
Yes, sergeant.
Oh, it's not you again ma'am.
Are you sure it's not the same fellow?
There are two fellows?
Look, I suggest you just sit there and wait, go around and see a neighbor and wait till the constable arrives, okay?
Coming!
Oh please excuse me, the front door was open.
I did knock.
Oh sorry, I was a sleep.
There are burglars on my balcony.
Are you sure?
Yes, I saw their evil looks.
They might be opening my doors now.
The front window wasn't locked.
Oh I see alright leave it with me.
I'll go see what they're up to.
Do be careful!
Yes!
What are we going to do?
Break the window.

She thought you were burglars.
Come on, get inside.

Sid was us telling how he used to dart playing.
Well in future Sidney, kindly remember that the students have more important things to do, did you get my point?
Yeah, and his point as well.
- Good heavens!
- What's the matter?
This door is full of holes.
Maybe it's a wooden worm.
Wood worm.
Yeah, it's alright.
Yes.
I just had a telephone call from Mr. Brown.
He says he Would be along later.
Apparently, he is tied up at his flat.
Oh, blimey.
Shouldn't we be going to untie him?
I was speaking metaphorically.
It is better you speako English.
Silence.
Now Mr. Brown may put up With you stupid remarks but I assure you
Will find me a very different kettle of fish.
Excuse me please, what is mean kettle of fish?

What is a comma?
Por favor.
What is a comma?
Comma is when you are unconscious.
That's a coma.
A comma is a Punctuation mark.
Oh, it's alright.
I don't think Mr. Brown is teaching you anything.
Master is teaching us very much English.
When I am arrived, not one body is understand me, now everybody is understand every thing I am speak.

Well, then in that case, if someone will stop you in the street and ask you the time what would you say?

Silence.
You!
Yes please.

A damn nuisance.
Have you never heard of swarm?
Yes please.
England call Pakistan a swarm.
Silence.
Oh sorry I'm late Miss Courtney.
So am I!
I have just been seeing how your students are getting on.
- Well, I think they're progressing.
- Yes, but in which direction?
What have you been saying?
Nothing, she is asking some questions and we are telling her some answers.
Well, that explains it.
Are you going away?
Only for one night.
I'm having my flat painted that's why I can't sleep there.
You're having your bed painted also?
No, just I can't stand the smell of fresh glass paint.
Where would you be sleeping tonight?
I'll probably stay at the YMCA.
Hey, much better that the YWCA.
I suppose any of you have a spare room, do you?
It would give me much pleasure for you to Share my humble house, but unfortunately, my cousin and his family and also his cousin and his family are staying with me.
You've got two families both living in one house?
Two families both living in one room.
You are very welcome to come and Stay with me.
Have you got a spare room?
No.
But I have a very big bed.
Well, thank you for the offer but I thing it'd better be in the YMCA.
- You can with me stay.

No.
I have a small bed, better much.
Okay, you stay with us.
Who's Huss?
Us?
Me and Giovanni.
Sure we've got a room.
I didn't know you share a flat.
Yeah, I had to leave my other place.
I had a big fight with the neighbor because of the noise.
What noise?
Every night after mid night guitar practice For one hour.
- Surely you can ask them to stop.
- No.
- Why not?
- It's me who practice the guitar.
And you still practice the guitar, do you?
- No, finish guitar.
- Thanks goodness for that.
Now I practice the drums.
What?
That's ajoke.
I don't practice anything.
What do you say?
- Will you stay with us?
- Well, I am
Okay, you stay.

Oh, thank you.
This is the hall, this is the kitchen, this is my bedroom, Max's bedroom, this is the Living room, and this
And that's my bedroom.
No, that's the bathroom.
Oh, where am I sleeping?
You sleep here on the sofa.
Sure, it's very comfortable.
What was that?
What was what?
That awful noise.
It's only a train.
Only a train!
This is worse then the Waiting room of waterloo station.
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
They only run every ten minutes After rush hour finish.
I'll never get to sleep through all that noise.
We'll give you cotton ball to put in your ears.
Well, I would need it.
Hey, we better go get the drinks.
You wanna come with us professor?
Well actually I'd like a bath if that's alright with you?
Okay, we'll be back in 10 minutes.
I left them here on the table.
Where is professor?
- Well he said he was going to have a bath. -
- Okay, come on.
Alright.
Just a moment.
Hello!
Max!
Giovanni!
Anybody there?
The sergeant!
Yes madame!
A burgaler.
Don't panic.
Stay where you are and I'll send a police car around right way.
- He's trying to pick next door's lock.
- Don't worry, I'll sort him out.
Oh, I do hope this sort of thing doesn't happen often.
I only moved in here yesterday.
Stand back, I'm going out there.
George, you stay with Mrs. Partridge.
Alright, come quietly.
- Oh, look you're making a mistake.
- Could be.
No but I'm staying here with a friend.
What's the address?
I don't know.
I've never been here before, you see?
I see.
Look there's a perfectly simple explanation
Well, why don't we come down to the station
And tell it to the perfectly simple sergeant.
Come on Ranjeet, it's your turn.
I'm thinking what I'm going to be doing.
You have been thinking for five minutes.
Patience
We are playing scrabblo not patience.

What happened?
You are supposed to throw it forward not to the backwards.
Where is it?
It's alright.
I see it.
Oh me.
It's a good thing you were wearing a turban Ranjeet otherwise it would have gone straight through your head.
Oh, blimey!
You wouldn't have felt it.
You will feel my first in a moment.
Come on Ranjeet.
I'm still thinking.
Yeah, Shiks are slow thinkers.
Shut up man.
We must have time limito.
Come.
Oh, I'm getting a good one.
Sugar.
No goodo.
Quel idiot!
Sugar is not spelled S-H-U-G-A-R.
I think you are mistaken.
You damn fool.
Everybody know sugar is spelled with two Gs.
We win!
You want game Juan?
We no have time.
Mr. Brown he will be here pretty soon!
You frighten you lose?
I bet you blind folded.
Let's see you get double the top with Your eyes closed.
Easy.
Easy.
Closed.
One, two,
Jamila.
Who did this?
Me.
I was trying to get that in top.
Looks like you get it in the bottom.
Are you hurt Sid?
Huh?
Did it hurt?
You bend down and you'll find out.
- What is going on in here?
- Not a thing.
- A dart game.
- I beg your pardon.
Sid was us telling how he used to dart playing.
Well in future Sidney, kindly remember that the students have more important things to do, did you get my point?
Yeah, and his point as well.
- Good heavens!
- What's the matter?
This door is full of holes.
Maybe it's a wooden worm.
Wood warm.
Yeah, it's alright.
Yes.
I just had a telephone call from Mr. Brown.
He says he would be along later.
Apparently, he is tied up at his flat.
Oh, blimey.
Shouldn't we be going to untie him?
I was speaking metaphorically.
It is better you speako English.
Silence.
Now Mr. Brown may put up with you stupid remarks but I assure you will find me a very different kettle of fish.
Excuse me please, what is mean kettle of fish?
You'll find out.
Now, until Mr. Brown
Arrives, I intend to find out what sort of progress you are making.
You, how are you doing?
How are you doing?
Very pleased, thank you.
How are you doing?
I'm inquiring about your English.
Your English
No, no, Hungarian.
You're hopeless.
No, no, look Hungarian.
Sit down.
Thank you.
You.
Give me the present of the verb to move.
You know it not?
Well, of course I know it.
Oh good, then you can me tell?
It is not my place to tell you anything.
Okay, then you can tell me not.
- You!
- Sí, señora.
What is a comma?
Por favor.
What is a comma?
Comma is when you are unconscious.
That's a comma.
A comma is a punctuation mark.
Oh, it's alright.
I don't think Mr. Brown is teaching you anything.
Master is teaching us very much English.
When I am arrived, not one body is understand me, now everybody is understand every thing I am speak.
I see.
Well, then in that case, if someone will stop you in the street and ask you the time what would you say?
That's wouldn't help them!
Oh yes, in my street, it's all Indian peoples.
Silence.
You!
Yes please.
Give ma a collective noun for a collection of ants.
Aunties.
Not aunts.
Ants.
Insects.
What is a lot of ants?
I don't use that.
Have you never heard of swarm?
Yes please.
England call Pakistan a swarm.
Silence.

[Gear noises]
[Gear noises]
Would you do me favor?
I'd like to stop talking, and when I do take a look at the room you're in and above all, at the man-made objects in that room that surround you, the television set, the lights, the phone, and so on,
and ask yourself what those objects do to your life just because they're there.
Go ahead.
Well, that is what this series is going to be all about.
It's about the things that surround you in the modern world and just because they're there, shaped the way you think and behave, and why they exist in the form they do.
And who or what was responsible for them existing at all.
The search for those clues will take us all over the world and 12,000 years into the past, because it's in those strange places, and in those long gone centuries that the secret of the modern world lies.
And you'd never believe the extraordinary things that led to us being the way we are today.
Things like, for instance, why a 16th century doctor at the court of Queen Elizabeth did something that made possible for you
To watch this screen, now.
Or the fact, that, because 18th century merchants
Were worried about ship's bottoms you have nylon to wear.
Or why a group of french monks
And their involvement with sheep rearing helped to give the modern world, the computer.
Or what medieval europeans did with their fire in winter, that led to motorcar manufacture.
[Prayer]
The story of the events and the people who over centuries came together to bring us in from the cold, and to wrap us in a warm blanket of technology, is a matter of vital importance!
Since more and more of that technology infiltrates every aspect of our lives.
It's become a life support system without which we can't survive.
And yet, how much of it do we understand?
Do I bother myself with the reality of what happens when I get into a big steel box, press a button, and rise into the sky?
Of course, i don't.
I take going up in the world like that, for granted
We all do, and as the years of the 20th century have gone by the things we take for granted have multiplied way beyond the ability of any individual to understand in a lifetime.
The things around us the man made inventions we provide ourselves with, are like a vast network, each part of which is interdependent with all the others.
I mean, cross the road.
Whether or not a car coming around the corner knocks you down may have something to do with a person you've never met fitting the brakes correctly.
Change anything in that network and the effects spread like ripples on a pond.
And all the things in that network have become so specialized that only the people involved in making them understand them.
I don't mean use them - anybody can use them.
Down there, is one of the biggest, most complex cities in the world;
Full of people, using things *as if* they understood them and sometimes not even knowing they're doing it.
New york city like all the other major high-Density population centers, scattered across the earth
Is a technology island.
It can neither feed, nor clothe, nor house, nor warm its inhabitants
Without supplies from outside.
Without those supplies, the entire massive structure and the teeming millions it encloses, would die.
And yet, in cities everywhere
We act as if that were not so.
We have no choice.
The pace of life in New York is set by the pace of the technology that serve it.
You just have to hope it will stay that way.
I'd like you to meet a few people who were in or near New York City on a November evening, over a decade ago.
And the reason I'd like to meet them is because they all have one thing in common.
They were all brought to a sudden and catastrophic realization of how vulnerable they were how dependent on one aspect of that technological network I was talking about.
Because of what this did to their lives.
Now, until i was told what *this* is,
I was no more able to recognize what it is that you are now.
But watch what it did to those people.
And, if you look very carefully, you'll see evidence of what this does in every second of what follows...
...now
It's one minute past 5:00 in the evening.
Rush-hour in downtown Manhattan.
800.000 people crowd onto subways looking forward to home - to the end of this journey.
For most of them, the technology carrying them
Doesn't exist.
They take it for granted.
Two minutes past 5, Kennedy airport;
The usual evening departure rate.
Passengers with appointments in New Delhi, London, Tokyo.
Appointments they expect to keep.
And 200 planes due to arrive in the next 5 hours.
[Announcement]
No delays expected.
Three minutes past 5.
At the energy control center, downtown, nothing special is happening.
It's the standard rush-hour condition in the main control room.
The time of day, when power consumption starts to come up to a maximum, as people head for home and meals get cooked.
It's cool outside, after a high of 58 the temperature's falling to an expected low of 39 with a predicted wind chill fact starts of 5 degrees.
The energy levels are more than enough to cope, even on a chilly November evening.
Ten past 5:00, Mount Sinai hospital.
The patient, Mrs. Marconna, is expecting twins.
[Banging hammer]
(James Burke) 12 minutes past 5:00
The UN General Assembly in session
The speaker is President Roosevelt's son.
In their boxes, the interpreters.
The invisible support structure of the debate, whatever the language.
At the U.N., that's taked for granted.
(James Burke) In the subway,
Herbert Friedman, a lawyer, reads his paper on his way home to suburban Jamaica.
Al Haydock works for a publisher on 5th Avenue.
He passes the time doing a crossword.
Marjorie O'Shaughnessy also works for a publisher looking forward to spending a quiet evening at home.
Steve Boetty, late, been to a movie.
Bruce Singer, works iin Greenwich Village.
Bill Palmer is a student, Just been playing basketball.
And Hans Kramer:
Insurance broker.
All these people take the subway every evening, they expect to get home, they always do.
5:15, Kennedy Airport.
At one of the international terminals on the board, Scandinavian Airlines 911.
Scandinavian 911 is on its way into Kennedy.
The pilot is veteran captain Carl Lustet.
Kennedy airport control, scandinavian 911
Weather information, Jenkins 5,000 feet, approaching riverhead.
Scandinavian 911, ROGER 1221 radio back to the final runway, four right
(James Burke) A clear moonlight night, the flight manifests lists 89 passengers.
(James Burke) The descent into Kennedy is so far, uneventful.
It's now 15 minutes and 30 seconds past 5.
Announcement on public system
Please fasten your seatbelts.
The runaway lights appeared, two apart.
Okay, nice feeling.
With the next contraction there,
You'll take a deep breath and push real hard, okay?
.
The big one's about to start.
Take a deep breath and
Push,Okay?
(James Burke) At Mount Sinai hospital,
Ms. Markana is in labor.
Okay Peter, I think you can put her to sleep.
(James Burke):
The anesthetic being used at the time
Is a mixture of gases,
Including one called cyclopropane.
It's potentially explosive, but everybody know that.
Okay, she's fairly sleep now.
Okay, with the next contraction we'll have a little bit of pressure.
All right, look;
she's starting contraction now.
Just a little bit more.
Okay.
Okay.
[Baby crying]
Okay guys, we've now got a baby.
(James burke) It's now exactly 16 minutes and 10 seconds past 5 one second later, several hundred miles north west of the New York City THIS did what it was built to do.
with disastrous consequences.
You may have already guessed what kind of technological network this is part of;
It's a bit of a Power Station.
The Power Station known as Adam Beck 2, here at Niagara, where electricity is generated by the tremendous power of falling water.
The water turns turbine blades that make a shaft spin.
At the top of the shaft are magnets, and they spin inside a cylinder up there, that has copper wire coils on its inner wall.
The interaction between the spinning magnets and the copper coils, makes electricity, that's where THIS comes in.
It's a relay, and its job is to detect changes in power going on to a transmission line;
These up here.
Power flows north along these lines, and on the particular evening in question, this relay detected an increase in power on one of those lines, that was above a pre-set limit when that happened, magnets set around this metal cup
caused it to rotate, and that brought this on to make a contact like this.
[Bang]
That contact was made on the evening of november 9th, 1965, at 16 minutes and 11 seconds past 5.
The effect was to cascade power off the overloaded line and on to another, which overload and tripped the next, until all five lines going north had tripped out, dumping their entire load onto lines going south.
Within seven seconds, the tremendous overload began to take out generating stations all over northeastern America, from Boston to New York, as the network fell apart.
As each area went, it overloaded the next.
Within 10 seconds, the only major system left was the great energy island of New York.
As the network fell apart, links between one energy center and another, broke, instead of 300,000 kilowatts coming into New York to help meet demand, 1.5 million kilowatts were draining out of the city to supply areas now cutt off from the network,
but still connected.
Like Leeches, to the New York Generators.
As the overload hit the New York generators, they too began to trip out.
[Siren]
As the lifeblood of the city drained, it went into spasm.
At the U.N, chaos, the power to keep the lights on also served the interpreters.
[Interpreters at work]
And without interpreters, trapped in their darkened boxes, deprived of access to the ears of the delegates, the United Nations was suddenly and totally disunited, as completely as if at war.
[Female interpreter]
The city's elevators stopped.
Perhaps the subways were the only technology that people expected to fail.
Here we go again.
(James Burke) 800.000 people were now deep in the ground, under New York, caught in a technology trap, most of them had never thought twice about.
As light went, so did the one in Ms. Markana's operating field.
(Female nurse) Okay, i've got her.
(Male doctor) What the hell's going on?
(James Burke) It was now only ten minutes since the crisis have been triggered by the relay at Niagara, more than 500 miles away.
The generators continued to trip out, and at the Kennedy airport, the radar screens went blank,
and flight 911 was in trouble.
Flag warning;
Switch number 22 ILA
Okay.
Kennedy airport - yeah, who've we got?
Yeah, John, can you hold it?
i'll take 200 if I can.
What time did it go off?
Started at 2131 out, they can't hold on.
(James Burke) By 5:28, the time had come to protect the system by deliberately switching what was left, off.
We shut down those lights in Broocklyn it's the only thing left going ought to kill the supply in Broocklyn.
Shall we leave that in or shut down it down?
We've got to shut it down, i guess.
The system operator recommends shutting down Staten Island
[Roar of vehicles]
(James Burke) Over an area of 18 million square miles, 30 million people were now in darkness.
John, i've goton the phone.
[Roar of traffic]
(James Burke) Isolated from each other in small groups, millions of people were still unaware of the extent of the blackout, in the subway especially.
(Male voice) people started chatting -- But for the most part,
No one really got into it yet, because we thought
It was just another typical rush hour delay, but it was dark, and that was kind of uncertain to be in such a crowd but not to be able to to see anybody, so one of the women had candles in her bag.
(Female voice) You know, i have some candles;
maybe we can light them.
(James Burke) This abnormal business of actually talking to anybody on the subway, caught on briefly, all over New York.
(Female voice) Let's put some light on the situation.
It's my birthday anyway.
Anybody feel like singing 'Happy Birthday' to me?
.
[Laughter]
Make a happy situation out of a terrible one.
(James Burke) But, while this journey had taken on a meaning nobody expected so too at the hospital, at ms.
Markana's delivery of twins, thanks to the anesthetic.
(Male doctor) There was then, a general scurry around to find flashlights and I immediately commanded one, so i can see what was happening.
One of the nurses whom i shall never forget,
Walked into the room, carrying a lighted candle.
Put the candle out.
Get out of here.
What's going on?
Get out of here,
I'm scared out of my mind, but especially with the anesthetic agent, i had visions of all of us, the whole place blowing up in one great conflagration.
(James Burke) The phone system was the only thing working, if you could get a number.
[Conversation in french]
I can't see the runway.
(James Burke) And captain Lustet
Was learning the full extent of his predicament.
ILS, the landing aid that guided him in, wasn't there anymore.
-
- And needs to check the radio.
Kennedy airport control Scandinavian 911,
The ils went
(James Burke) The extraordinary thing in the subways was that a full hour into the crisis, nobody was trying to escape from the trap.
[Multiple voices]
(Male passenger) I just assumed that something went wrong with the particular train that i was riding on.
There was a feeling of "it's being something to wait out together".
There was nothing anybody could do about it, no one knew anything about anything.
(James Burke) Put yourself in this position, would you do any different?
Here they were, one hour into a major disaster, and still trying to laugh their way out of it.
[Laughing and chatting]
(Male voice) People began to be very jovial, and began to sing
"Show me the way to go home" and everything that people could think of, that related to our plight.
At the hospital, darkness made no difference.
[Multiple voices]
(Male doctor) Well, the baby was delivered without the lights, because you didn't need the light for the delivery.
That's manipulative, remember, you're reaching up into the uterus, grabbing a foot, which is strictly by feel, erupting the membranes and you bring the foot down.
The second baby was vigorous, and we prepared the babies.
(Female nurse) There you go, you're such a pretty girl, yes.
(James Burke) Captain Lustet had only a few second left to make his decision.
He was at 2.000 feet, past the airport, and heading straight for Manhattan in the darkness.
[Roar of plane]
There was only one thing he could do:
Lustet and 200 other jets that night, landed with the help of radio working on planes sitting on the ground.
In the subway, people were still coping.
(Male passenger) About half an hour or an hour and a half, people became very restless.
It was not, not pleasant;
it was not very congenial, but everybody felt scared.
Never been this late before.
you sit here and wonder and wonder,
And sent nobody down to help us.
[Multiple voices] Somebody knocked on the window
After about an hour and a half of thiss train employees would pass outside, but not look at us and not asnwer us.
When we were banging on the windows and called out, they just ignored us.
I think he's a conductor from a train, but i'm not sure.
(James Burke) Gradually, finally, people began to realize where they were, lost under the ground, helpless unless help came.
(Male voice) Well, we have a major power blackout, it's at least hit the entire city.
Let's all relax;
We'll be trying to get you off
As soon as possible, okay.
[Multiple voices] I don't knok how long this will take,
It's con edison
And it affects the entire city.
We have people coming by, evacuating the trains now, please relax
(James Burke) Ms. Markana found out what had happened to her, though not the way she expected.
(Ms. Markana) How's that?
When i woke up and i saw hall the candles lit around the room, I thought I was dead.
And where was a priest standing nearby, and for a minute there, I thought he had come to give me my latest rites, and i was afraid that all my family when knew that I was --
and they came to light candles for me.
Don't be frightened now;
you're going to be okay.
(James burke) And finally, as in all good faity stories, it was over.
(Male voice) And exactly 5 hours after the train stopped, about 10:30 the train began to empty by having all the passengers walk out singly upon the catwalk.
(James Burke) A few days later, people were back at their daily routine as if it had never happened, the night New York became a trap, forgotten.
This is one of the more perfect examples of the kind of technological trap that we set for ourselves.
The lift, the elevator;
I mean, what is this?
It's a steel box with some buttons in it, and, maybe, a trapdoor for emergency.
But whoever looks that close, Except when this happens, where is it?
and even in this situation, closed in, with an escape route that we can't handle, we behave like many of those new yorkers did.
We strike a light and we look around to see how badly things are.
And, if we find in this case, an emergency button, absolutely great; we sit back, and, we wait for help to come.
We wait for technology to come back and save our lives, because it's inconceivable that it won't, isn't it?
I mean, if you admit that, you've got to admit that every single day of your life, in some form or other, you unconsciously walk youself into a technology trap, because that's the only way to live in the modern world.
So, you don't admit it, you say, oh well, in the situation, we'll cope.
But, what happens when the effects become widespread, irreversible, devastating?
What happens when, what little resources you have to help you cope, give up.
Then what?
Well, in all the disaster scenarios you read, what happens is that without power, technologically based civilisation cracks up rapidly.
Without enough auxiliary power, and most major cities don't have it, organisation is imposible.
It's every man for himself, looting and arson follow, and in a city not prepared to be a fortress, supplies run out, fast.
And, however frightening the thought of leaving your technological room, soon or later, there is no way to go but out, away from the danger.
The minute you decide to move you're on your own, in a way that no modern 20th century city dweller has ever been, in his life.
And then the traps begin to close.
To start with, do you even know where to go in order to survive?
Did you manage to get a map before you left?
And if you did, how do you get out?
Walk, drive until you run out of fuel?
Are you ahead of the millions of other people pouring down these roads, trying to do just what you're trying to do?
And if they catch up with you, have you got something they need?
And if you have, can you protect yourself?
Did you bring enough food and drink to last as long as necessary, and if you didn't, where will you get, steal?
How far out will you have to push on, until you're far enough out to be safe?
And can you be sure that's far enough?
And even, if by some miracle, you finally make it, do you know enough to recognize a place to stop when you see it?
I mean, what does survival without technology look like?
There'd be no signs up.
So, let's say that finally, somewhere far out into the country, you come across a place that looks right.
and, let's say that you've had the good sense, and the good luck, to look for a farm, because that's where food comes from, isn't it?
Okay, so it's a farm, so you decide to stop.
Has anybody got there first?
Or, are the owner still here?
Because you're going to need shelter and people don't give their homes away, they barricade themselves in.
So, sooner or later, exhausted and desperate, you may have to make the decision to give up and die or, to make somebody else give up and die because they won't accept you in their home, voluntarily.
And, what in your comfortable urban life has ever prepared you for that decision?
Okay, let's say by some miracle, the place is empty and it's all yours.
Is there enough food in the house?
How long would it last?
How would you cook it?
Wood fires;
are you fit enough to chop all the wood you need before winter comes?
If you're lucky, you've got livestock on the farm.
Great: meat, but can you slaughter and bleed and butcheires,
Okay, supposing you manage that, you've got enough meat to eat until you've eaten all the cows, but at least you can, start running a farm.
But, it's a modern farm, remember?
It's mechanized.
There's a gasoline pump, but it's empty.
So, you can't use -- The tractor.
What you need is horse and cart.
But, when did you last see a horse and cart on a modern farm?
And everything else here, the saw, the power drills, the light, the sterilizer, the water supply, the sewage system, the hoist, the milking parlor, the pumps, and everything on this control panel
demands the one thing you don't have - electric power.
Everything on this farm that you found, doesn't work.
The place is a trap.
But, there's nowhere else to go.
The only way you're going to survive is if you find the one thing you need, to keep on providing the food you're going to have, and you don't need a mechanized version of that thing.
You need the kind, people haven't used in a 100 years.
Ah, you need that kind of plough;
you're saved.
Or are you, because What it comes down to at this point is this, can you use a plough?
It's taken a series of miracles just to get you this far, and here you are, with the biggest miracle of all, a plough, and animals to pull it.
So, maybe after few days of fumbling around with the harnesses and the bits and pieces, you manage to yoke up the oxen and plough the land.
And then, and only then, can you say that you have succeesully escaped the wreckage of technological civilization, and lived off the land and survived.
if you know how to use the furrow, you plough,
I mean, can you tell the difference between an ear of corn and a geranium seed?
Do you know when to sow, ehatever it is you think it is?
Do you know when to harvest it, and eat the bit that you think isn't poisonous.
I mean, it's no accident that the chain of events, triggered off by that relay in the power station, back there in Niagara Falls ends here with the plough.
The relay itself doesn't matter, i mean, any one of a million things could fail and cause our complex civilization to colapse for an hour, for a day, however long, because that's when you find out the extent to which you are reliant on technology, and don't even know it.
That's when you see that, it's so interdependent, you take one thing away and the whole thing falls down, leaves you with nothing, unless you can plough and survive, and start the whole process off again, from scratch.
And, it's no accident that to do that, you have to have a plough.
Because it was the plough you that triggered everything off, a long way back in the past,
After a different set of people also found out that their comfortable life was falling apart --
-- in a world where events came to a point where a fundamentally new way of life had to be found.
That's exactly what happened about 12,000 years ago in maybe four places on the earth, Nothert India, Syria, Egypt and Central America.
It stopped raining and got very hot.
The result of that change in the weather was to lead an invention, that would trigger the development of a civilization, that ends with us in the modern world.
Let me explain that.
You see, the high grasslands started to dry out, became like this place, and the plants and the animals that had sustained the wandering tribes, started to disappear.
People began to die.
There was only thing that survivors could do, head for water, and so, down they came, into the great river valleys.
Here in Egypt, that river was the Nile and the Nile was an extraordinary river.
It rose in two places, from one, it brought rotting vegetation, and from the other, potash.
and any gardener will tell you what that means.
When it flooded every year, it dumped compost and fertilizer onto the land, and the land bloomed.
Too well.
With easy flood, the population grew to where Not even the Nile could support it without help.
Faced with starvation, the river dwellers tried planting grain by hand.
Not enough.
What solved their problem was an invention that triggered off a series of events, because that invention was to trigger the beginnings of civilization.
This is the first great man-made trigger of change, the plough, because with it, you know how much harvest you're going to get next year, and because of that, you know you're going to be here next year.
And after a while, when you can produce surplus food, then, that's when things really start to move, in the tiny settlements.
With regular food supplies, the population explodes.
The village expands.
There are more buildings, and they're bigger for bigger families, and they're more permanent.
You domesticate animals for their milk and their meat and their skin, because they're not there to hunt anymore.
and, basket weaving and the twisting of grass to do it, teaches you how to spin flax, and that makes linen.
But, it's the grain that causes the fundamental change, because with it, you can bake the bread that is the staple diet on which everybody lives, and you learn about ovens, and about the effects of heat on mus and brick.
But, above all, you have to have somewhere to store the grain surplus, in pots.
But, there's so much surplus by now, you need the posts to be made faster, and you need them to last longer.
So, the potter's wheel happens, then comes the problem of, who does it belong to?
And the only answer to that is this, writing.
And the very first writing takes that form, a name and a symbol for what's inside this pot, or a lot of pots or an entire village granary.
And so, the little villages grew with their huts and their granary and then, almost out of nowhere, it seems, that happened.
The oldest stone building in the world, the step pyramid of king Zoser at Saqqara near Cairo, built around 2700 B.C.
Instant sophisticated architecture from mud huts, in one jump.
How did they do it?
Because of what they'd had to do to feed themselves, irrigate.
Because the river flooded every year, and destroyed landmarks and then, retreated, leaving the soil to dry out, they had to do two things:
find a way of measuring lands, so the farmer got his own fields back, and a way of channeling the water away for use after the flood had gone.
The kind of measurement you need, to do those things, involves geometry and the type of mathematics a civil engineer uses, and building canals teaches you to work stone.
[Hitting stone]
If you know stonework and geometry and mathematics, you can build pyramids, especially if a strong central government, that was developed to run the irrigation schemes in the first place, tells you to.
If the pharaoh said he wanted a pointed stone monument, that's what he got.
Funny thing is, the same drough that drove everybody down to the Nile, also preserved the things they built, like their tombs, for thousands of years.
The stuff on the walls in this tomb for example, is 4.500 years old, a kind of cartoon view of the civilizations the plough created.
I mean, look, here's the irrigation, here are these people carrying water pots, you see them?
And, they carry them across and they pour the water into a garden that has wall around it.
And then, over here, look, there's a fellow doing a bit of weeding.
There's the plough, they domesticated oxen,
They tried to domesticate any animal that they can get their hand on.
I mean, take a look at this, animal flat on its back, tie its back legs, hang on its front legs, stuff food down its throat, and hope it'll learn to love you.
Didn't get too far with that one, it was a hyena.
Well, you've got a growing community, and plenty of spare food,
And you'll need to protect yourself.
So, making weapons becomes very important.
And here, on this wall, is the whole thing about handling metals.
Look, here are the "Weights and Measure" people checking on how much metal's going to be used.
Next to them, the furnace men,
You see the way they're raising the temperature?
They're blowing on these tubes to create a draft in the furnace, to get the temperature high.
Next to them, here's the molten metal being poured into a mold, and here, a fellow's beating it flat.
Okay, you get yourself a kingdom, you get what you deserve.
You get bureaucrats, here they are, the scribes writing everything down.
See the pens behind their ears?
In this case, they're noting taxes.
Here the people coming in to pay their taxes, led persuasively by the local police.
Here's a policeman, with the rod of office, more policemen, here's an egyptian scruff of the neck, he obviously doesn't want pay.
If you end uo not paying they get out their whips, and they tie you to a pole.
And that's what you get for not coming up with the money.
So, you have a busy sophisticated society,
You have to have peopel at the top, in charge.
This is the tomb of one of them.
He was a kind of egyptian chancellor, responsible directly to the king.
There he is: his name was Miraluka.
By sometime around 3200 B.C., the entire 700-mile length of the Nile, from the Mediterranean to Aswan, was united and administered by officials like Miraluka, each one running what was called a water province, a section of the irrigation network,
and of the river, under his command.
What held it all togheter was the king's magic ability as a god, to come up year after year, with an inundation of the Nile, and to know exactly how high the waters would do go,
of course, it wasn't magic, it was his astronomers.
They observed that one particular star, Sirius, rises just before dawn on one particular day, the 17th of july, every year, and that day is one day before the flood begins.
They also saw that on average, the flood itself came once every 365 days.
Now, you put those two facts together, the star before dawn and the flood, and you've got yourself a calendar.
Under the calendar you can organize people, you can give them a date to do something on.
and for the King's ability to predict how high the water would go, well, you record the level of the flood every year with a scratch on the wall.
And after a while, your experience will tell you, early on, how high the water's going to be later.
Now in Egypt, where water is life, that kind of knowledge and the ability to control, gives you the power to build empires.
These are the great ancient temples of Karnak, on the edge of the Nile, about 450 miles south of Cairo.
They were the center of egyptian religion build in the imperial of city of Thebes, when the egyptian empire was at its height, the greatest power in the world, this was the New York of the time.
The temples were built over a period of about 2.000 years,
Each pharaoh adding his bit, living his name in stone to last forever.
Inside the temple domain, there were 65 towns, 433 gardens and orchards, 400.000 animals, and it took 80.000 people just to run the place.
Small wonder that centuries afterwards, the greeks and the romans came here, and gawked like peasants, at a civilization that made their efforts look like well-dressed mud huts.
It still has that effect today.
You come here, from the great modern cities, full of the immense power of modern technology
At your fingertips: press a button, turn a switch, and this place -- stops you dead.
And then, just when you think you've got the measure of Karnak, you come here at dawn, to the hall of columns, one of the most massive structure ever built, and anything i was going to say,
isn't enough.
Look at it.
[Dramatic music]
The egyptian built an empire, and ran it with a handful of technology, the wheel, the irrigation canals, the loom, the calendar, pen and ink, some cutting tools, simple metallurgy, and the plough, the invention that triggered it all off.
And yet, look hoe complex and sophisticated their civilization was, and how soon it happened
After that first man-made harvest, the egyptian plough, and those of the few other civilizations that sprang up around the world at the same time, gave us control over nature, and at the same time, tide us for good to the things that we invent,
so that tomorrow will be better than today.
The egyptians knew that, that's why they had gods, to make sure that their systems didn't fail.
Karnak was the first great statement of what technology could do with unlimited manpower, and the approval of the gods.
Ironically, the modern equivalent lies again, in the desert.
This time, the nomads also settled by a river, a river of oil.
But, what it took the pharaohs 4.000 years to build, took the kuwaitis 4.000 days.
What's happened in Kuwait, the change from a nomadic existence to being able to buy and use everything modern technology has to offer, has come in much less than one generation.
[Arabian music]
Kuwait represents the immense power of technology used in a way most of us have never experienced, because we've lived with a kind of change it can bring, for more than a 100 years.
Here, it's been focused.
Change has been instant and total.
[Arabic language]
Kuwait has suddenly become like New York, or any other of the great urban island of technology, totally dependent on that technology, like them, without it,
Kuwait would return to the desert.
Hello, how are you?
Hey listen, I'm coming to spend my Christmas in New York, okay?
(James Burke) You see how increasingly, the only way we, in the advanced industrial nations, with our bewildering technology network can survive, is by selling bewilderment and dependence on technology to the rest of the world.
Or is it not bewilderment and depence, but a healthier, wealthier, better way of living, than the old way?
And yet, whether or not you dress up technology to look local, the technology network is the same.
And as it spreads, will it spread the ability to use machines as we do, without understanding them.
Somebody said, a few years ago, about the way our modern world affects us all,
"If you understand something today, that means it must already be obsolete."
or, to put it in another way, never have so many people understood so little about so much.
So, why are we in this position?
Why is our modern industrialized world the way it is, and not some different way with different technology, doing different things to us?
Well, that's what the rest of this series is going to look at.
You saw, just now, the plough and irrigation kicked us all off.
And, that an invention acts rather like a trigger, because once it's there, it changes the way things are.
And that change stimulates the production of another invention, which in turn, causes change and so on.
Why those inventions happened between 6.000 years ago and now, where they happened and where they happened is a fascinating blend of accident, genius, craftsmanship, geography, religion, war, money, ambition.
Above all, at some point everybody is involved in a business of change, not just the so-called great men, given what they knew at the time and a moderate amount of what's up here
I hope to show you that you or I could have done just what they did, or come close to it,
because at no time, did an invention come out of thin air into somebody's head, like that.
You just had to put a number of bits and peices that were already there, together, in the right way.
Following the trail of events, from some point in the past, to a piece of modern technology, is rather like a detective story with you as the detective, knowing only as much as the people in the past do,
and like them, having to guess at what was likely to happen next.
So, the trigger that sets off the first of those detective stories -- is that.
And i'd like to leave you with one question before next time: why does a modern invention that fundamentally affects the lives of every single human being on this planet, begin 2.600 years ago, with somebody doing this:
[rubbing stone]?
- Ow!
My foot!
- Where do you want me to sit?
- Shh!
- Sit on her foot.
- Shh!
We're supposed to be hidden.
- Pretty lady.
- Boy, look what beautiful glaze she's got on her eyes.
- I'd call that glassy-eyes.
- Mmm.
- This one on the end.
- Wait a minute.
- I'm not sure who -
- Wait a minute.
You're not sure?
I thought you knew what you were talking about.
Oh, my God!
- What is it?
- She has a big spot on her dress.
Wait a moment.
I may have something.
Just a minute.
Sorry.
- Nervous, baby?
Here.
I'll take care of it.
Just a minute, honey.
Looks like a fly.
It looks like somebody squashed a fly on your dress.
My God.
Look at your sister.
Isn't she beautiful?
It's perfect.
- Here we go.
What do you say we stick with -
If you do that one more time I'll break your arm.
Uh, please.
Let's not fight.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God... and in the face of the- this company... to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony...
- which is an honorable estate instituted of God -
- It was a fly.
and therefore is not by any to be entered into... unadvisedly or lightly... but reverently, discreetly, advisedly... soberly and in the fear of God.
Into this holy estate... these two persons present come now to be joined.
If any man can show just cause... why they may not lawfully be joined together... let him now speak... or else hereafter forever hold his peace.
Her's got a dress like me too!
Dino, wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife... to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony?
Wilt thou love her, comfort her... honor her and keep her in sickness and in health... and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her... so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
Muffin.
- Muffin.
- Oh, uh, Muffin... wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband... to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony?
Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honor him... and keep him in sickness and in health... and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him... so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
Who grivets this woman to be married to this man?
Snooks Brenner.
Liam.
It's Irish.
Nurse.
- Nurse.
- Yes?
- Any sign of them yet?
- Of who?
- The wedding party.
- Uh, no.
No.
I don't see them.
Yes.
Here, birdie.
Here, bird, bird, bird, bird.
Here, birds.
Here, birds.
Mrs. Sloan, what are you doing out of bed?
I told you not to feed the birds.
You heard what Dr. Meecham said.
Dr. Meecham's a friend of mine, but he couldn't cure a ham.
- You've been smoking again.
- Oh.
- Now, you know it's bad for you.
- Yes, Mrs. Sloan.
- Did you ask Randolph to come up and see me?
- Yes.
He said he'd be right up.
Is the wedding over?
Oh.
I'm sure it must be by now, Mrs. Sloan.
- How sure?
- Well, it's almost 2:00.
A formal wedding only takes about an hour to perform.
That's ridiculous.
With Bishop Fuddy-Duddy presiding it could take a day and a half.
Poor old dear.
He's been in mothballs for 25 years.
I shouldn't have taken him out.
First we must get the rings for him.
Get the rings.
- What?
- Get the rings.
- Oh, yes.
- The rings.
The rings.
And then we turn to the altar.
- Bless -
- Bless, O Lord, this ring- these rings -
- That they - - that they may - they who give the- give them
- Oh.
I don't believe it.
Where are the flowers?
There's all these tables that have no flowers on them.
Come on, girls.
This should have been done hours ago.
Will you do up your dress, my dear girl?
This isn't a circus.
It's a wedding.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Run, girls.
What do you have legs for?
Correct.
Correct.
Co -
What on earth is this doing on the table?
Bloody Mary mix?
Is that what you call a uniform, Randolph?
You look like you're dressed for a picnic.
No, madam.
It's just that I haven't had a chance yet to go down and put on my jacket.
- There have been quite a few telephone calls.
- That's no surprise.
Randy.
Now, Randy.
I expect you to be on your best behavior today.
And you know what that means.
- Yes, madam.
- No conversations with my daughter in front of the guests.
- No, madam.
- No whisperings.
Not even looks.
- Now you promise.
- Yes, madam.
- The groom takes the ring for the bride.
- Huh?
- Groom.
The groom takes it.
- Find a way to do this.
- There.
There you go.
That's good.
- Everything's beautiful, Ingrid.
We have plenty of time.
- Looks terrific.
You better leave this kitchen as immaculate as you found it.
- Oh, don't worry about it.
It'll be
- It'll be all right.
- It better.
Let me see those birds over there, will you?
Ah.
Ah.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Superb.
- Oscar.
- Yeah?
I
- I think I'm really getting sick, you know.
Oh.
Well, come on.
Let's get out of this hot kitchen.
Go in the other room where it's cool.
You don't look good at all.
My head is just killing me.
I can't see.
- Will that be all, madam?
- No.
Please tell the wedding lady to come up to see me.
One drink is one and a half jiggers.
Now, that's not one jigger, and that's not two jiggers.
That's one and a half jiggers.
You may get someone who will ask you for a double.
You give 'em a double.
A double is two jiggers.
if you see that you don't have enough champagne -
- Miss Billingsley.
- Yes?
- Mrs. Sloan would like to see you.
Now.
- Mrs. Sloan.
Little does Mrs. Sloan realize that Miss Billingsley... has a thousand and one details to look after.
Here's some more.
Don't take pills.
Those are the wrong kind of pills.
I don't care what she says.
As soon as we get you straightened out, you're going home.
- Take these.
These are a lot better.
- And go to bed.
They'll really make you feel good.
I should be home and go to bed.
I'm dying.
I'm really dying.
Mrs. Sloan.
Oh.
Mrs. Sloan.
Come here.
It's a lovely wedding.
Hmm.
How many guests did we have?
- Guests?
- Mmm.
Well, there were no guests, Mrs. Sloan.
It was a family wedding.
Remember?
The guests are gonna come to the reception.
You want to bet on it?
What about the telegrams?
Were there many regrets?
- Oh, regrets.
- Mmm.
Oh.
A few.
More than a hundred?
- A few more than a hundred.
I knew it.
Oh!
My family!
Bless
- God the - God the Father -
God the S - God the Father...
God the Son, God the Holy Ghost.
I pronounce that you - that they are man and wife.
Amen.
Amen.
You may rise.
- Jesus Christ!
- Jake.
Jake, right here.
Jake.
Okay.
Um -
- Thank you, God.
Catastrophe.
- Miss Billingsley, she's gone.
- Oh, my cake!
Miss Billingsley, she's dead.
She knows about the regrets.
Someone must have told her.
Randolph.
Randolph, she's gone.
- Gone where?
- She's dead.
Dear Mrs. Sloan.
It happened so suddenly, Randolph.
One minute she was fine, then she was dead.
I mean, I've never seen anything like it before.
She just stopped.
You know what I mean?
Randolph, nobody's ever died before.
I mean, I've never taken care of a dead person before, Randolph.
What am I supposed to do?
Randolph, what am I supposed to do?
Hello.
Mrs. Corelli.
- Dr. Meecham.
- What is it, Randolph?
There's something awfully important I must discuss with you.
- Well, can't it wait?
- Sorry, Dr. Meecham.
It can't wait.
Uh, Dr. Meecham.
Just a minute, Randolph.
Bartender.
- Yes, sir.
- Give me a double Jack Daniel's on the rocks, and hurry it up.
May I help you?
Are you Miss Billingsley?
No, no.
I'm Mrs. Corelli.
I -
Oh, no.
Mrs. Corelli is at the church.
You see, the wedding isn't over yet.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Uh, sir.
No.
Sir.
Oh, my God.
Don't.
Please, sir.
I could be fired for that, sir.
Miss Billingsley told me not to let anybody pour their own drinks.
- Who are you?
- I'm with security.
- Now, what is it, Randolph?
It's Mrs. Sloan, Doctor.
I think she's -
- You think what?
- I think sh -
I think you ought to see her, Doctor.
I own this house.
Randolph -
- Just a minute.
- could you please explain to this insane person who I am?
Jules.
Jules.
Jules.
- I can't believe it.
- Let's not touch the car.
Look at it.
That's for you, my boy - from your mother and myself.
- Do you like it?
- It's great.
- Oh!
It's beautiful!
- What am I gonna do with the other one?
It's for Muffin.
It's for you.
Oh, honey, it's beautiful.
Uh, by yourself.
Thanks a lot.
Man, look at that.
Give me some sugar.
Mmm!
- You look as pretty as the bride today.
You know that?
Let's shoot right here.
Okay?
No.
- How many rooms you figure they have in there?
- No.
Let's shoot right here.
A lot of'em.
I'll tell you that.
- Do you read?
- Take my arm.
Oh, hey, Louie.
What kind of car is that?
- A Mercedes.
Mercedes, we say.
Mercedes-Benz.
- Mercedes?
- Mm-hmm.
- Now I speak Italian.
As usual, you just missed everything.
Is anybody hearing me?
Is anybody getting this?
Oh, will you look at this?
You give me some sugar now, and you go upstairs with the other girls.
Oh!
- You're looking pretty too.
- Hi.
Welcome to the family, son.
You can call me - Uh, no, don't call me pop.
- Call me Snooks.
Okay?
- Okay.
What a beautiful wedding.
Yeah.
Geez.
I haven't been in a church since Tulip and my brother got hitched.
All my marriages were civil.
- Or not so civil.
- Occupe.
- I belong to a church group.
- Ah?
We do charity work.
I do interpretive dancing.
I dance in hospitals and -
Someone's in there, Mrs. Goddard.
It's that tall French girl.
uh, prisons and insane asylums.
- That's Victoria.
She's not French.
She's our cousin.
- I really enjoy helping people.
Okay, Sis.
- How does it feel to be father of the bride?
- I'm proud.
- Proud as I can be.
- Come down to my grotto for some special drinks.
Oh.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Grotto.
It's like a large Italian sewer... where the Christians used to hide from the Romans.
- Oh, the woman who went to-That tramp.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Honey.
Let me go in before you.
Honey, I have got to go to the bathroom so bad, I'm about to pop.
You'll let me go in front of you, right?
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's all right.
I can wait.
- Oh, thank you.
- Hello.
Oh!
Thank God!
Oh, my God.
Oh, well.
Must be -
No.
Just
- It's gotta be here someplace.
Just a minute now, everybody.
- Quiet.
No.
Ah!
I found it.
All right.
No.
No.
No.
Mama first.
This whole thing just isn't gonna work unless you take off that damn wedding ring.
- Cameron'll kill me.
- He isn't here.
Besides, he's probably gonna kill you someday anyway for something.
You might as well give him something to kill you for.
- Hey.
- Hey!
It's the groom.
- Hey, Dino.
Can I have a ride in that Mercedes later?
- Sure.
- That thing is intense.
- Yeah.
It's all right.
I wish they would have gotten us the S. L. C. though.
- How come?
- It's a four-seater.
What do you want with four seats, Corelli?
You have a family we don't know about?
- They say a man's home is his castle.
Amazing how many people go down to the basement to have fun, huh?
- Well, looks like we're going into a torture chamber.
- This is my throne room.
- Ah!
- Louis, I see you got a new jukebox here.
Uh, where do you put the coin?
What do you think - What do you think of my kingdom?
- Look here.
Looks like a cave in here.
- It's quite remarkable.
Hey.
Speaking of thrones, Louis, is the plumbing still functional?
Hmm?
Oh, yes.
Of course, Mac.
Right around the corner.
This is great, Louie.
You got this place fixed up just like a real Italian restaurant.
- No offense.
- You have a keen eye, Snook.
This is an exact replica of my favorite cafe in Rome.
- The hell you say.
- A link to my heritage.
So, uh, what are you, in the restaurant business in Italy too?
Yeah.
You-You might say so.
Where's my gift?
It's too big to be mislaid.
Did you intercept it?
Now, why would I do a thing like that, darling?
Of course not.
I'm sure it'll be along.
I'm gonna go up and see Mother.
Um, Aunt Bea, would you like to come with us?
- Where?
- We're going to see Mama.
If that sister of mine wants to see me, she can just walk down those stairs... instead of receiving callers as though she were some dowager queen.
Look, I don't think it's a good idea if we descend on Mother in droves.
- I'll go up there by myself.
- That's silly.
Mama loves it -
No, dear.
Toni knows best.
This is a beautiful room.
Must be yours and Dino's room.
This is my room.
Dino has his own room.
- Oh.
I have my own room at home too.
But, um, it's, uh- it's only got one bed in it.
I
- I only use one bed.
I'll see you in there when you're finished, okay?
Hi, y'all.
Hi, Muffin.
How you doin'?
- I feel so much better.
- What is this?
The line?
- You might say so.
- Buffy, you were so beautiful today.
Really.
Daddy thought so too.
I want to thank you for being my maid of honor... 'cause, really, we've been able to share the happiest day of my life.
I just hope you can be as happy as I am someday.
I've been thinking about it.
Put these down your dress.
- Down my dress?
- Trust me.
Just, you know, to kind of push yourself up.
Well what's it like having that little boy you used to take baths with... all of a sudden be a big old grown married man?
I can't believe it, to tell you the truth.
Hey.
I'm sorry about Briggs, Dino.
That was a real fish move, wasn't it?
- What happened to him?
- Uh, knowing him, he probably got lucky last night.
- Yeah.
Knowing him, best man wasn't good enough.
Lemay, the fly.
It was probably a case of sour grapes, Corelli.
After all, you took his girl.
- Daphne, I want you to know -
- But hide 'em.
- that I kind of know what it's like being a twin.
- What are you doing that for?
I'm so close to my brother Hughie, you know?
And I don't want you to ever think that you're losing a twin... but I want to assure you you're gaining a sister.
- And I hope we can be real close.
- Time will tell, I guess.
- Go ahead.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, no.
That's all right.
- I can wait.
- No, no, no.
That's all right.
You just go right on in.
- Regina, how are you?
- Oh, stop fussing, Clarice.
Where did Toni go?
- She went up to see Mama.
- But Jules is with her.
Jesus, Nettie.
You couldn't even wait until the party was over.
Dr. Meecham, I thought you would like to break the news to the family.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, uh, yeah.
Yeah.
All-All right, uh, Randolph.
Uh, I'll take care of it.
Very well, Doctor.
She was feistier than ever this morning, Dr. Meecham.
- I mean, I couldn't even keep her in bed.
- That figures.
I was looking at your hair in church.
It is beautiful.
- It really is beautiful.
- Thank you.
Yeah.
I have often thought of going blonde myself... but I'm kind of scared to bleach it, on account of it might, you know, get straw-like.
But yours looks real natural.
Would you mind if I asked you what you use on it?
- Oh.
- Oh.
I'm
- I'm sorry.
That's probably a family secret, isn't it?
Well, listen.
Hey.
We're all family now anyway.
Lord, your hands are cold.
- Guess it's pretty rotten timing, huh?
It's never good.
- Mother.
- Oh, uh, she, uh
- She can't talk now, dear.
I'm, uh, taking her temperature.
I'm sorry, Jules.
Don't try to speak, darling.
I just wanted you to know that the wedding ceremony was absolutely divine.
And we missed you.
How's her temperature, Jules?
- Uh, a little below normal, I think.
- Below?
Nothing to worry about, uh, under the circumstances.
Well, I'll stop by later and see you.
- Love and kisses, darling.
- Uh, Toni.
I don't think Nettie should have any more visitors just now.
I'd like her to get all the rest she can.
- So, uh, if you'll tell the others.
- I know.
The poor darling.
She's been under such a strain lately.
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.
- Hold the fort until I get back, Janet.
- What am I supposed to do?
Don't do anything.
Just stay here.
Uh, ashes on your chest.
As far as anyone else is concerned, she's just asleep.
- Gentlemen, shall we toast to the occasion?
To the children and their new life.
- Ah.
May they inherit the Earth.
- Evviva.
Dear Lord Jesus, we invoke thy spirit on these young people... as they engage their hearts and minds and bodies in holy matrimony.
- Want some champagne?
- Oh, shoot!
Thank you.
- Lemay, the fly.
- Excuse me.
- Christ.
- He's awfully interested in your fly, isn't he?
Yeah.
That faggot's interested in everybody's fly.
Oh, The Fly - Oh.
I remember The Fly.
That was a great picture.
Uh, David Hedison, Vincent Price.
- I'll see you down there.
- Catch you later.
Excellent film.
Science fiction -
- Hey, Hughie.
- Hi, Hughie.
How are you?
- I wonder if he saw us.
- Did you see Buffy?
- Oh, she's in looking in the mirror again.
- Yeah.
Just squish 'em.
- Have you got it?
- Naturally.
Sure.
Buffy.
- Buffy.
- Okay.
All right.
Are you ready to go down?
- I will be.
- Well, here he is- the brush boy.
- I forgot my flowers.
I'll be right back.
- I'm glad you had it.
Guess it's the last time I'll be doing it for you.
Oh, you shouldn't put tap water on your face, hon... 'cause it'll dry your skin out and give you wrinkles.
That's okay.
I plan to age interestingly.
Oh.
You are cute.
I wish you were my sister-in-law.
- Do you smoke?
- No.
It
- It makes me dizzy.
- Me too.
That's why I like it.
- Well...
I try to do natural things.
A lot of people in my family died of cancer.
Bye.
They-They-They died of cancer from smoking pot?
- I got a little surprise for Dino.
- A frog.
- That's great.
Wait.
Between you and me we gotta find out where they're sleeping.
Dino and Muffin.
Okay?
- What for?
- 'Cause we're gonna put the frog in the bed, man.
- All right.
Are you with me?
Yeah.
I'm with you.
That's great.
That's great.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Hey.
Did you ever hear of a movie called Frogs?
- Frogs?
No.
- Frogs.
It starred Ray Milland.
He played this industrialist.
Poor old Briggs.
He's really gonna miss out on this one.
He owned all these factories, you see... and he kept polluting all these rivers and stuff.
- Amen.
- Salute.
- To the kids.
- [Speaking Italian]
Evviva.
Have either of you acknowledged delivery of a rather large painting?
Negative.
I mean, no, ma'am.
Nothing rather large has been delivered.
Well, then, when it arrives I would like to be notified immediately.
Thank you.
Hmm.
Just look at this workmanship.
- Isn't that interesting?
- You can't touch the gifts.
There's no touching the gifts.
Would you put it back where you found it, please?
- Thank you.
- You don't say.
Well...
I'll have you know that I - Oh, never mind.
- Okay, Ma.
What's going on?
- ... a boy treating his mother like that.
- After all I've done for you.
- If you've got a beef with Chris and me...
- we want to hear about it.
- I've got a beef.
Boy, have I got a beef!
.
- All right.
We're listening.
- You two slept in the same room last night.
If that's the way you want to conduct your lives...
I say fine, but not under the same roof with me.
Are you happy with your work?
Guarding, hiding, sneaking about... spying on your fellow man?
Such a handsome lad too.
You could be doing something constructive... working with your fellow man on a farm or a factory.
We need workers in factories.
- And you
- Why, you could be having babies.
- I like my work.
Well, shame on you then.
Pinko.
Ooh!
Don't you sweet-talk me, Kevin Clinton.
It won't work.
Mrs. Clinton, please.
Listen to him.
Chris is my wife.
We were married -
I don't care what -
- Married?
- That's right.
- On the way from Boston.
We just decided to do it.
- Oh!
You big galoot.
Why didn't you tell me last night?
- Well, we couldn't.
- We didn't want to upstage Dino's wedding, Mom.
- Oh.
- May I call you mom, Mom?
Call me Mom!
Who's that man right there?
Over there.
In the red.
Randolph.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Uh, miss, you're not going to be using lights, are you?
- Clarice.
Not now.
- Nobody's around.
Listen to me.
Your mother- she died.
Toni'll die when she finds out I heard first.
- You must not let them know.
- Mrs. Goddard.
My name is Florence Farmer, and I just wanted to apologize for our conduct at the church.
We'll have these things out of here as soon as possible.
- As soon as you can because the guests are coming.
- Absolutely.
You look lovely.
Mom's gone.
I can't believe it.
Miss Farmer -
- Randolph.
- I'm just leaving.
We do not have time for these little jokes.
Darling, I've just been up to see Mother, and she's fine.
But I don't think we ought to visit her any more today.
You know, she's tired... and it's been so much excitement with the wedding and everything.
Shoot up here.
Jake.
- Hey, Ms. Goddard.
- Regrets.
- Uh, Antoinette.
- Oh.
- Toni.
We call her Toni.
- Oh, well, that's a lot easier.
How's your mama feeling?
I was just telling Clarice.
I just went up to see her, and she's fine.
She's resting.
But I don't think we ought to go up and call on her.
- No.
- No, no.
I
- I don't think she's -
- She's been under such a strain.
All the excitement.
- I understand.
Certainly.
You know, you're very lucky to still have your mama.
- Mmm.
- I lost mine when I was 1 3 years old.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- That's a terrible time for a young girl to lose her mama.
- It's hard.
You look like the Jolly Green Giant.
- Green for gardener.
Get it?
- Green for gardener.
Perfect.
- Doctor.
- What is it?
- Could you come to the kitchen?
We need you in the kitchen.
- What for?
- Well, there's a lady back here that's not feeling well.
- What seems to be the problem?
Did y'all see that movie, uh, Carrie?
- Movie?
No.
- It was this, um- this horror film.
And the thing that happened to her in that film happened to me in school.
The exact same thing.
Only hers happened in the gym class...
- and mine, uh, happened in algebra.
- Mmm?
- Turned into a woman right there in school.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Am I dying, Doctor?
- You shouldn't even be out of bed with a fever like that.
I know.
I should be home.
That's what I said to everybody.
I want to go home.
But if you insist, I can give you something that'll keep you on your feet.
No, I don't insist, Doctor.
Please, I can't take any more pills.
These won't hurt ya.
Get me a glass of water, will you, dear?
- Really.
I mean, pink -
- These won't hurt you.
I take 'em all the time myself.
- But I'm allergic to pink.
- I made her a hot toddy, but she won't drink it.
No, no.
She shouldn't have any alcohol at all.
- Take the pill, Mrs. Hellstrom.
- All right, all right, all right.
Here we go.
Everybody on the count of three.
One, two and three.
Good.
Sir, could you keep your eyes open, please?
- Sir, could you step out of the way?
- Who's closing their eyes?
This is just for the ushers.
Thank you.
Please.
One
- Gentlemen, please.
One, two and three.
Your, uh, invitation, please, sir.
William Williamson.
Thank you, sir.
Walk this way, please.
Let's have this gentlemen move to the front.
Nice smiles.
On the count of three.
Here we go.
One, two and -
Would you like to sign the guest book, sir?
- One, two, three.
- It's a game.
- Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
Will you please hold the positions?
Fellas.
Mr. William Williamson.
Mrs. Sloan.
William Williamson.
No.
I'm not Mrs. Sloan.
I'm Mrs. Brenner.
I'm the mother of the bride.
Oh, congratulations.
She's married well.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure to be at a Sloan wedding.
I'm Luigi Corelli.
I happen to be the husband of former Miss Sloan.
Oh.
I'm sorry my wife isn't here tonight... but she cut her fingertip off with the rose cutters.
Oh, what a pity.
- Hello.
William Williamson.
- Uh, Snooks Brenner.
- Right.
- Father of the bride.
Chairman of the board.
Oh, Your Eminence.
William Williamson.
Seer.
He took my cane.
And three.
Sir, please.
Keep the magazine down.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, hold it right there.
Just hold it for one more, gentlemen.
- Please, gentlemen.
One more.
Hold it right there.
- All green.
- Thank you.
I "rentaled" this.
- Oh.
Green!
- Hi.
I'm Rosie Bean.
- Rosie Bean.
- That's my husband Russell over there.
- Hello, Russell.
- Um, this is my friend Shelby -
- Hi.
and she does not, uh - she left her husband at home.
- She's alone here at the wedding.
- Nice to know you, Shelby.
- She's kind of on the loose.
- Ah.
Good.
Good.
That's it, Miss Billingsley.
The last guest.
Flo.
Flo.
- Rita.
- Help me.
- What's the matter?
- Atrocious.
Will you go down the receiving line for me?
- Oh, God.
- Take her down the receiving line, Melba.
- Say hello for us, Flo.
- Take her down the receiving line... and see if you can find anyone else who's decent and take them down the line.
Oh.
- Hey.
You look like you're pregnant.
- Seven months.
- Seven months.
- I do this a lot.
- Good.
Congratulations.
Hi.
- Corelli.
- You look Italian.
- Half.
Half.
Yeah.
There's a lot of Italians around here.
- Mr. Corleone.
Florence Farmer.
- Corelli, please.
- Corelli.
This is a fine house you have here.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Corielli.
I'm sorry about the disturbance at the church, but, um -
- We met before.
- Oh, yes.
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Clarice.
- Florence Farmer, head of the film team.
- Ah.
Well, I'm Snooks Brenner.
Head of the bride.
- Are you all right?
- I spoke to Toni, and Mama's resting.
- Congratulations.
- Oh.
- I'll go through the goddamn line.
How are you?
How do you do?
Thank you, Russell.
- Isn't she pretty?
- Oh, she sure is.
- Nice to see you.
- How are you?
Russell's my name.
- Luigi.
- Louie?
- Louis.
- Um, would you go down the receiving line?
- I should be in line.
- Yes.
If that sister of mine weren't sick upstairs, she'd be in line, you can be sure.
- Of course.
Uh
- Oh, why not?
- Ah.
Great.
How you doin', cowboy?
- Mrs. Godard.
- Goddard, darling.
Mrs. Goddard.
We've got all stations at alert.
- Terribly sorry to put you through this -
- That's all right.
- Would you go through the receiving line?
- Of course.
- For the bride.
- Come on, Mac.
We might as well.
- Well, looks like we'll all do this.
- Father.
- Reverend.
- Reverend.
- Yes.
I'd be happy to.
- Oh.
Thank you.
- It was a lovely service.
- Ingrid Bergman.
- Yes.
I'm Giuseppe Garibaldi.
- [Speaking Swedish]
Oh, that Swedish cateress.
- I'm your servant.
- Aunt Bea.
I don't know how to keep these kids from touching the stuff!
.
- I don't like to hit them.
Hey!
- Don't touch that.
Don't let 'em touch any of the gifts, Koons.
Now, they're just kids.
You ought to be able to handle it.
Excuse me.
Jeff Kuykendall, chief of security.
- Well, you do a wonderful job.
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you.
- Everything satisfactory?
- Sure.
- It's working.
Can you help me to a bathroom?
A private one.
Why don't we go upstairs, sir?
Right this way.
Follow me.
- I just saw Mother, and she's fine.
- Follow me, Bishop.
I think you'll have more privacy upstairs here.
Crowd control is always a problem in my line of work.
Especially when you get 300 or 400 people trying to use the same bathrooms.
You get potential - Excuse me, sir.
Didn't mean to run off and leave you like that.
- Lean on me, Bishop.
Take my arm.
- No, no.
You think I'm weak or something?
Want to do it yourself.
I admire that, sir.
You just set your own pace.
I'll stay with you this time.
Very nice to see you.
You go ahead.
You go ahead.
I can do this.
This is Kuykendall here.
Uh, I'm going up to the second floor with the bishop.
Uh, Abernathy, you better fill in for me.
I may be up here longer than I expected.
- Doin' fine, sir.
- Nice to see you.
Anytime you want to stop and rest, you just give me a signal.
There we go.
Just a few more.
Hi there, pretty lady.
- That, uh, sounds like a line.
- Well, it is.
Well, I like it.
I like it.
Here you go, sir.
Best bathroom in the house.
Enjoy your day.
Go on.
No.
Actually, I'm, um - I'm the sister of the father of the bride.
- Marge Spar.
Glad to meet ya.
- Marge.
I'm
- I'm Jim Habor, and I'm an architectural, um -
No.
Actually, I'm the
- I'm the gardener around here, and I just kind of -
- Ah.
Hey.
The gardener.
That's terrific.
- What?
Really?
Yeah.
You know what?
My, uh - My second husband
- His name was Jim too.
- Jim?
- Yeah.
He couldn't mow the goddamn lawn.
I know the feeling.
Yes, Jules?
What is it?
It's Nettie, Luigi.
She's gone.
Yeah.
It happened just before we got back.
[Speaking Italian]
[Italian] She planned this.
- [Italian]
- In English, Luigi.
English.
- Of all times, now?
- It's never a good time.
The fact remains that somebody's gotta tell the rest of the family.
Oh, no, Jules.
Not now, for God's sake.
We'll do nothing.
We say nothing.
- Well, they have to know sometime.
- Jules.
I have to see you right away.
I'll
- I'll be there in a minute, Regina.
Her mother's lying upstairs dead.
Please, Jules.
Let me handle this.
I'll tell Regina after you've seen her.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will follow tradition.
The first dance will be danced by the bride and the groom together to their favorite song.
And then the F.O.G. will cut in and dance with the bride while the groom dances with the M.O.B.
Then the F.O.B. will cut in and dance with his daughter... while the F.O.G. will cut in on his son and dance with the M.O.B.
And then- and only then, ladies and gentlemen - may you commence to dance.
And now, for their very first dance together as man and wife... the new Mr. and Mrs. Corelli.
- Melba.
- Where are they?
- What are they doing in the hall, Melba?
- I don't -
Get them!
Oh, I love a good wedding.
I went to a lollapalooza last week.
They had 2 4 white doves, you know, and this great big canopy for the bride and groom... but there was a time delay, and 24 dead birds fell on the bride and groom.
Oh, they're coming.
Here they come.
- Just go ahead and dance.
Yes.
The first dance.
- Get a load of this.
- Good Lord.
Uh -
- Hugh.
Hughie.
What are all those?
It's nothing.
They're just some pills.
- You're not sick, are you, dear?
- No, it's okay.
I have to take them all the time.
What on earth for?
Epilepsy.
- Jules.
- Hmm?
Jules, isn't epilepsy something you can inherit?
Damned if I can remember, my dear.
I must have missed that class.
But, uh, I can look it up for you.
- Who has epilepsy?
- That boy.
Muffin's younger brother.
Ingrid.
- Ingrid.
Please.
You're spoiling everything.
You're spoiling everything.
Please don't spoil everything.
Did you pick this song?
No.
But that must have been why they were asking me about it.
I saw it on TV last week, and I was just saying how much I like Jennifer Jones... 'cause she has such pretty teeth.
You look so beautiful on this, uh... saddest of all occasions.
You know?
Of course I know.
I wish she'd waited.
She was alone.
Alone?
Well - Well, we are all alone.
You know, parallel lines.
Parallel lines.
I guess one can't ever prepare oneself... for one's parent's death.
Mama and I were very close.
I was
- I was her favorite.
Your mother is dead?
Gone?
Bye-bye?
We're the only ones who know.
Death is a horseman.
Death is a thief in the night.
Death is a four-letter word.
What?
Excuse me.
Mrs. Brenner.
You're next.
- Oh, is it time for the M.O.B.?
- It is.
So, Muffin, you happy?
Oh, I'm very happy.
I love Dino very much.
Love him.
That's good.
Only don't spoil him too much.
You know, it can be difficult for someone in his situation.
Second generation of all of this.
- God, he's dreamy.
- Oh, Italians always are.
How do you think he got so rich?
Well, Russell says that he is mafioso for sure...
- and Russell's never wrong about things like that.
- Yeah.
You really think so?
- Well, whatever Russell says goes in my household.
- Hmm.
Hey.
Hey.
You see that gal over there?
The bridesmaid.
That's, uh, Daphne, I think.
- No.
The one next to her.
The one with the bangs.
- The one with the real red lips.
Yeah.
You got it.
Yeah.
You know who that is?
Do you think she looks like me, huh?
- That's my kid sister.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Well, I knew you had a sister here.
- Oh, go on.
That's my daughter.
- Your daughter?
- Mmm.
- No.
I don't believe that.
- What is your secret?
- Aw.
Well, I guess we have the Drummond Military Academy to thank for all of this, don't we?
You know, when-when we first moved right next to the military academy...
Snooks was really kind of worried about it, because he - he kept saying that he thought maybe some of you boys would be a bad influence on our girls.
Well, I just put my foot down, and I said...
"Snooks, any boy who is willing to go through that kind of discipline...
"and who has that kind of patriotism...
"to go to a military academy nowadays... well, he's worthy of either one of my girls."
Yeah.
Drummond's okay.
I mean, after I got kicked out of my last school... most of the other schools wouldn't even take me.
- Hi.
- Fine.
Must be really fascinating to be a twin.
Interesting.
I think the thing that interests me the most is how... incredibly different two people can be...
- that shared the same womb.
- Do you hear a frog?
What's the matter?
- I thought I heard a frog.
- What?
- Croaking.
No.
It must have been the trumpet player.
Missed a note.
- Did you hear a frog?
- No.
I didn't hear anything.
No.
- Mac!
- It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
- Mr. Brenner, you're next.
- Oh.
- Oh.
No, no, no, no.
Goodness, no.
- Oh.
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry.
No, no.
With the bride.
- Oh.
Not yet.
Not yet, Buffy.
- I'm sorry.
- I have to dance with Muffin right now.
- Sorry.
I thought you understood.
You look great.
If you weren't my mother, I would have asked you to marry me.
Oh, sweetheart.
I want you to be really happy.
I'm happy.
I'm always happy.
I know.
Don't you find it a little cold in here?
- This is my kind of music.
- Well, I don't know who picked it.
They thought it was my favorite, and it isn't.
Well, it's in the family.
It's Buffy's favorite.
- I told them that.
- Oh.
- The last should be the first.
- What?
Well, it's a serious matter.
A sister's a sister, even if she's dead.
Sister?
My sister's dead?
You got it, comrade.
- You're drunk.
- Impossible.
I never drink.
Miss, please.
Why don't we take a little walk?
- Why not?
- Right this way.
Oh.
Here you are, you old sinner.
Ah.
Thought I couldn't make it up those stairs, didn't you?
Dear good Lord, that was quite a climb.
Playin' possum, huh?
Well, let me tell you, Nettie, you don't fool me.
I know you wanted a quickie service.
No frills, no fancy ceremony.
Well, I'm here to tell you, old fox... your granddaughter -
No.
Grandson.
Yeah.
Your grandson got the bishop's best today.
I didn't miss a cue.
I haven't done a wedding in fif - 25 years.
Well, Mrs. Know-It-All, you'll come around.
And I'll be at the gate to let you in when it's your turn.
Just remember.
I've got 25 years on you.
And - And I always will have.
- Who the devil are you?
- Oh.
I'm just the nurse, Your Honor.
- Well, don't you believe in knocking on doors, young lady?
- Yes.
- Yes, Your Honor.
Uh, what?
Oh.
She says she's your nurse.
Well, never mind.
Uh, I've got what I wanted here.
Uh, see you in church, old girl.
- What the hell is that?
- That's a glass of milk.
Stuff'll kill ya.
Dr. Meecham, as a physician, you should know that the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
- You mean you don't drink?
- No.
In other words, when you get up in the morning, that's as good as you're gonna feel all day.
- May I cut in?
- Oh, sure.
Jules, for God's sake, what are you trying to do to me?
- Shall we go to your room?
- Oh, yes, please.
Excuse me, big fella.
- All right.
- Hello.
Nice place you got here.
Yes, sirree.
What a- a place like this run you on the open market?
- Well, I really wouldn't have any idea.
- Oh.
- You all live here together, do ya?
- No, no.
Just my sisters and Luigi live here with Mother.
- Mac and I live in Palm Beach.
- Oh, I hear that's nice.
- I understand Frank Sinatra lives there.
- No.
That's Palm Springs.
Oh, right.
- Hey, you.
- You have got lipstick on your collar.
- Well, I was dancing with that -
- Let me see your mouth.
- Look at that mouth.
- Oh, get out of here.
- Let's you and I dance now.
- Oh.
Okay.
Well, how you doin', sweet thing?
You staying away from the champagne?
Well, I had just about a half of a glass to take my pills with.
But it's okay.
I
- I promise I won't -
Hughie, you know better than that.
Mama -
- May I have the honor of this dance?
- Oh.
Mr. Goddard.
- Mackenzie.
- Uh, could I dance with my sister, mister?
I'm sorry.
You know, I
- I have always been embarrassed by the fact that I can't dance.
I -
Of course, back home in Louisville... we don't have much occasion to, except for the socials at my brother's church.
And then, of course, that's mostly square dancing.
I
- I hope
- I hope you don't mind my asking you to dance... but I find you devilishly attractive.
Thanks.
I -
What do you do down there in - what is it
- Palm Springs?
- No.
Palm Beach.
- Palm Beach.
You go out on the beach and get a tan, do you?
- No.
I have my own business.
- Oh, yeah?
What do you do?
I design maids' uniforms.
- Do you like older women?
- Well-
I like my mom a lot.
My husband, Snooks, is a marvelous dancer.
You kn - He's a regular Fred Astaire.
You ought to see him and our oldest daughter Buffy dance together.
Well, I tell you, they get out there... and they just glide around that floor like they were Siamese twins.
It is absolutely beautiful.
Pretty good yourself.
- S-Something I ate.
- Lemay, what are you -
- Are you all right?
- Did you bring that damn frog up here?
- No, sir.
- You stand up straight.
Did you -
- No, sir.
- Get rid of that thing right now.
Go on.
- Yes, sir.
- You put that thing loose in the garden.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Why do you think he has a frog with him?
- Well, it's a long story.
I just -
- Oh!
- My God.
I could just cut my foot off.
- Oh, no.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Come over here.
Sit down.
Your beautiful wife, Antoinette, tells me that, uh, you are an art collector.
I think that's just wonderful.
I love art.
Of course, I don't know too much about it, but I do know I love looking at pictures.
I think it would just be wonderful to be able to collect it like that.
You certainly don't look like an art collector.
Well, you know, if, uh... you were walking down the street and somebody pointed you out... and asked me what I thought you did, and I didn't know you...
I would never in a million years guess art collector.
You could go on What's My Line?
and stump the panel.
I can't wait any longer, Tulip.
There's something I must say to you.
Well, of course.
You go right ahead.
My goodness.
I've just been rattling on and on, and I haven't given you a chance to say one word.
You just go right ahead.
I love you, Tulip.
Now, I don't think that's very funny, Mr. Goddard.
I know it sounds insane... but I've never felt like this about anybody else before in my life.
I'm an intelligent, well-educated man, Tulip... but I know myself, and I know my heart.
There are four billion people on this planet.
When I saw you in church, our love chemistry clicked on.
- And I just can't deny the fact that I'm -
- Oh.
Oh, no.
- I've fallen hopelessly in love with you, Tulip.
- Oh, don't.
Please.
I know.
I know.
Please.
Please.
I know it's brash, and it's foolhardy.
- It makes no sense at all.
I know that, Tulip.
But it's real.
- I can't help myself.
- Oh, no.
Don't.
I have to be with you.
I want to be with you and touch you and -
- Oh!
- feel you -
- Oh!
- speak to you.
Please don't go.
Please.
Don't
- Don't go.
We-We could meet.
- We could meet later.
- Oh!
Jules, hurry up.
I feel so awful.
I feel so cold.
It'll just be a minute, dear.
Luigi saw me.
You know how upset he gets me when he sees me like this.
And everybody saw me.
I know they noticed.
All the people.
Why'd you do it?
You're not indispensable, you know.
This is no question of money.
Ouch.
Oh, I can't get used to that damn needle after all these years.
All the people.
- There you are.
And the wedding.
We haven't had a wedding here for years.
A wedding.
Oh.
Jules.
Did you notice Daphne?
- Who?
- Daphne.
- She was the prettiest of them all.
- Oh.
Well, come on now.
Come on.
Let's get down there before they miss us.
There's a party, you know.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You can't come in here.
Mrs. Sloan is sleeping.
Tulip.
Are you looking for a bathroom?
Here.
I'll show you.
Come on.
You can use mine.
- Jesus, Janet.
What the hell are you doing out here?
- Straight ahead.
You're supposed to be in there with Nettie.
I know, Doctor, but I just had to have a cigarette...
- and you know she doesn't like me to smoke in there.
- Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
Gotta keep those ashes off your chest.
Jules, come and join the party.
- Lovely woman, isn't she?
- Who?
- Tulip.
- Yeah.
Well, she didn't look like she was feeling too well.
I thought she looked lovely.
- Dino.
- Huh?
- I'm pregnant.
- What?
I'm going to have a baby.
Huh.
That's great.
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Well, you're the father.
- Asshole.
Whoa.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hold it!
You can't go thr -
I got it, Burns!
All right, son, you wanna show me some identification?
Whoa, this is some getaway car here.
Come on.
Ho.
Who was that son of a bitch on the driveway with the goddamn motorcycle?
- Briggs, dear.
- Regina.
- Must be a guest.
- What happened to you?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I spent the night in jail.
- Ohh!
Are you all right?
- Oh, Toni, I'm so sorry I missed the wedding.
- I had a terrible fall -
- Hello, Tracy.
Welcome, dear.
- I had a terrible fall on Noteworthy this morning.
- Jules!
Come here!
- I want you to look at her.
- I'm really much better now.
But I was out for about five hours.
- We went on a short hunt.
I was trying to exercise his leg -
- Hi, Tracy.
- Hi, Dr. Meecham.
- I think it'd be a good idea if you examined her.
- Can you do it here?
- Did you have a little fall?
- Yes, I -
- Let's have a look at it.
I stopped off at that tournament yesterday at Lake Airdale.
Stopped at a restaurant and some kids ripped me off- money, license, I. D. , everything.
And cut my clutch cable.
So I called the cops.
They put a run on me and found a warrant out for a guy named Briggs.
- Spent the night in jail.
- Lovely.
Come and join the party.
Take a - Take a deep breath, huh?
Now, hold it.
Now let it out slowly.
Good.
- I'm really all right -
- You had a - a leaf on your chest.
Oh.
Anyway, I want to apologize because I was so flattered to be invited -
Now, look at my finger, dear.
Look at my finger.
- I saw you in the lineup.
- Hi, Uncle Jim.
- She's all right.
- See?
I'm really fine.
You're the Tracy I've heard so much about?
- You must be Muffin.
- Yes.
I'm Muffin Corelli.
So, Muffin...
I've heard a lot about you too.
When do your braces come off?
Oh, and by the way, congratulations.
You two make an interesting couple.
Where is Dino anyway?
I've gotta congratulate him.
Hey, that was quite a story.
This is quite an occasion.
Son of a bitch.
So you really went and did it, huh?
Hey.
- Couldn't stay away, huh?
- On my roomie's big day?
No way.
Did I miss anything?
Oh, not really.
Except Buffy just told me she's pregnant.
- You've gotta be kidding.
- Ha-ha.
No.
But I hope she is.
- Well, it wasn't me.
- She says it's me.
- Well, was it?
- Dino!
- Tracy.
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- Sorry I missed the wedding.
She has many talents... and she is a genius when it comes to things to eat -
- That's a lot better than braces, now, isn't it?
What happened?
It's here!
Everyone into the gift room!
Muffin!
Dino!
Into the gift room!
Let's go see the gift.
Everyone into the gift room, ladies and gentlemen!
- Stay right here till the room clears.
Well, so you're Tracy, huh?
- Yeah.
Who are you?
- Wilson Briggs.
- The roommate!
Oh.
- Mm-hmm.
- Ex-roomie.
- Ah.
- You ruined my entrance.
- You didn't help mine a whole lot.
How'd you know who I was?
- You were Dino's pin-up girl for a couple years.
- Before Little Miss Muffet, huh?
- Before and during.
- Oh, you know her, then?
You might say so.
She was my girl when it all began.
Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, join the club.
Tulip, Tulip, my precious Tulip.
Oh, please.
Please don't.
Please d -
My sweet, my treasure, my baby.
Dino's off to a good start - he's knocked up her sister, Buffy.
- What?
- The maid of honor.
- No shit!
- Of course, I'm telling you this in the strictest confidence.
Oh, absolutely.
Why would I wanna tell anybody?
My love for you is like a shrine.
I could kneel before you till all eternity.
Don't you understand that this is absolutely wrong -
Oh, my God.
Please get up.
You must get up.
You're making a spectacle of yourself.
- I don't care.
- Oh, but I do.
All right, look, we've got to meet.
We need some time.
Meet?
- I can't meet you.
- I've got it!
The perfect place is the greenhouse.
We'll be alone there.
- The what?
- The greenhouse.
You take this path out the side door and it leads right to it.
- You can't miss it.
- I am sorry!
You must excuse me!
I have to go mix!
- I'll meet you there in five minutes.
- No!
- It's too soon.
- Ten minutes.
Come on, Buffy, honey, come on.
Let's go see all your sister's gifts.
As some of you may have been aware, I have been very impatient most of the day... awaiting the arrival of my gift for Dino and Muffin... on this, their wedding day.
Well, it's here... and I wanted everyone to share in the presentation... as it is a very special interpretation of Muffin... by a very important socialist-minded young artist...
Raoul Benton.
- He calls it Bride for the People.
- Lovely.
Lovely!
- All right, Muffin!
- A socialist Botticelli.
- What the hell is going on here?
Did you pose for that?
You'd better say no.
- What kind of a present is that anyway?
- Daddy, I didn't pose for it.
It's just a picture from my yearbook!
- Somebody cover that up!
- What the hell is the big uproar?
Hey, Snooks, hell, all you gotta do is get some guy... to paint a goddamn bikini on the goddamn thing!
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now proceed to the cake room.
- Miss Billingsley, we cannot.
These people are hungry.
- Melba, do as I say!
The food will be spoiled!
Y'all wanna go to the cake room?
I'll set an example now.
Here I go.
We're going to the cake room.
- I'm sorry.
- That's crazy.
- I-I'll meet you in there.
- Okay.
- How's it going, Daph?
- Great, Trace.
That brother of yours sure is full of surprises, isn't he?
- That's right.
- I just found out another one.
- You wanna know what it is?
- Sure.
Well, it seems that he's impregnated your sister-in-law, Buffy.
Oh, excuse me.
- I wish I was stoned.
My God, Aunt Bea!
Now, don't start, Antoinette.
I have certain ideals... that are far more important to me than mere conventions or -
Oh, forget that radical nonsense.
How can you ignore the fact that our family has money?
Which, by the way, I notice you manage to live off of very comfortably... despite your egalitarian views.
And as far as the common masses are concerned...
I'm the one who has a factory that employs over 300 people.
300 fascist cowards who fled their land rather than fight.
300 refugees from an egocentric, maniacal but attractive dictator.
- 300 -
- There's no point in arguing.
We're not gonna get anywhere.
Here's to tonight.
Right-Who?
- Your wedding night.
- Ah.
Okay.
Don't do that, sir.
This is my daughter, and I'm covering it up.
Look, I never punched no woman, but if you force me to -
Sir, I don't want to have to neutralize you.
Damn it.
- Excuse me.
My dearest Tulip, how wonderful you came.
Yes, I-I did.
I came for one reason only, and that was to tell you we have got to stop meeting like this.
- But, Tulip, I -
- No, please.
Please.
Please, just - just hear me out.
I am thrilled and flattered by all the nice things you have been saying -
I'm in love with you, Tulip.
Like that one.
But we-we can't go on like this.
Don't you understand?
You-You have to stop.
Not until you answer this one question.
I must hear "I love you" come out of your mouth.
Right now that's the most important opening in your body.
Could you love me?
Oh, please.
Oh, God, please don't.
Please just leave me alone.
I must hear it from your lips, one way or the other.
Yes.
- I'm so scared.
I know, I know, my dearest.
Life is a frightening experience... and love is even worse.
My legs are shaking.
I won't let you fall, Tulip.
I'll never let you fall.
- Oh, please, not now.
- Hello, Aunt Tulip!
- Oh.
- That's a lot of broken glass.
I've been looking for my earring.
Why don't you help us find it.
Think you could?
First one to find it gets a quarter.
Make that a hundred dollars.
- Roll sound.
- All right.
Come, tesoro, sit down.
Listen, I brought you here... because there is something you must be told... and I would like to be the one to tell you.
- Now -
- I haven't been bad, have I?
- Of course not, darling.
- I've been all right?
You've been marvelous, as always.
Thank you, Aggie.
It was lovely.
That's enough.
It was a table in the sunlight.
Do you remember?
- Yes, yes.
- Remember when we first met?
- We sat near the sidewalk in the sun -
- Tesoro.
- Tesoro, are you with me?
- Yes.
- Do you know where we met?
- No, you're not.
- We met in Rome with Toni and Clarice.
And then you came over to us... and I ordered more and more food just so I could talk to you.
- Sure.
- I didn't know what I was ordering.
- Do you know mademoiselle only taught us French?
- Mm-hmm.
And Mama got very annoyed.
What a funny little thing you were.
And you fell in love with me right then.
- The moment you saw me.
I shall never forget paying your waiter to let me replace him.
And then -
May I, madam?
- Your humble busboy.
- Thank you.
Then that first letter from you.
And we had two beautiful children.
Mm-hmm.
And I asked Mama if you could come to America.
And she
- No.
No.
No, she let you come here.
And then we had the twins.
That's right.
That's right.
You must remember that letter.
You told me the first thing you did coming back to your country... was to have a blood test... to make sure... you didn't contract any disease.
And then I was allowed to join you.
- You kept your promise all these years.
- Mmm.
- You kept your promise to Mama, didn't you?
- I sure did.
You're a good man, Luigi.
So good.
And, I'd say, an understanding one.
I must have loved you very much, because - because that was a very peculiar thing to do, wasn't it?
- It was worth it, wasn't it?
- Yes.
All the pain.
All those horrible pains when I had the twins.
I gave you a son.
I did.
Didn't I?
Yes.
But listen now, tesoro -
And now he's married.
Dino's married.
- I must talk to you -
- My son.
- [Sighs] Now, Regina
- Regina -
- It was worth it, wasn't it?
- I must talk to you.
- I haven't done anything wrong, have I?
- No, I told you -
- I can't help it.
It wasn't my fault.
You know that.
Nobody noticed.
I promise you.
Nobody noticed.
Nobody saw it.
Let's go - Let's go back now.
- We can't.
We can't go back.
- Why?
You used to think I was beautiful.
Ladies and gentlemen... marriage is the single most important event in a lifetime.
The interests of the community and of nature... fuse at this moment... though they so often conflict during the rest of man's life.
Now, there are certain accepted customs which one must observe.
Some because they involve social and economic factors -
Reverend, I'm surprised to find you interested... in such mundane matters as cakes.
- Oh, Mrs. Goddard, I was not always a servant of the Lord.
- Oh?
The first 20 years of my life I spent mired in sin.
I drank.
I smoked.
I danced.
I did every kind of physical indulgence that you can think of.
And then one night...
I was in a Holiday Inn in Arcadia, West Virginia... in bed with somebody... and I decided to watch television.
So I got up, turned it on and laid back down, waiting for it to warm up.
Well, there was no picture.
And instead of the regular sound... the voice of God came to me from that TV set... and it said, "David-"
And I trembled, 'cause I knew who it was.
And I said, "Yes, Lord?"
- And the voice said, "Enough is enough.
So I got right up out of bed, drove right back to Kentucky... and I found the woman that I had impregnated and deserted... and married her, of course.
This is my lovely wife, Candice.
Then, about five months later, we had our son, Matthew... and he's living proof of our sin.
- How utterly amazing.
God bless you, Mrs. Goddard.
Now, do not attempt to bring the blade down like a lever.
One straight thrust, followed by a series of similar thrusts.
I think the cake should have been chocolate.
Briggs.
I have something for you.
Where have you been?
- How could you leave me alone this long?
- Clarice!
There's a lot for me to do.
I promised your mother before she died -
We can get married.
We can live here.
Car keys and the marriage certificate.
You are the best man.
I was only standing in for you.
- So these are your responsibilities.
- Okay, I'll take care of it.
We can't live as man and wife in this house.
W-W-We just can't.
Society did not accept Luigi.
They're not gonna accept me.
We have something that is very special.
Clarice, let's not ruin it by trying to improve it.
Isn't it beautiful?
Aren't you proud?
What the hell is the matter with you?
Beautiful?
That damn painting is an insult to our whole family.
- Painting?
It sure as hell ain't nothin' to be proud of, unless you got your head screwed on backwards.
- Well, I am sorry.
- That's true.
You're the sorriest woman I ever seen.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
I would like to call upon a very special guest - a most distinguished clergyman... the spiritual adviser of the Sloan family...
- and of the Corelli family for so many years...
Bishop Martin.
Would you honor us with a blessing?
- What's she talking about?
- She wants you to bless the bride and groom.
I already did that!
Oh, it would be wonderful, Bishop.
Truly, it would.
Ohh
- Nobody said anything about a blessing.
Thank you.
A-Always calling on me to -
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today...
- to welcome the coming together... of two young people, Dino and...
Muffin...
- in the sacred bond of holy matrimony.
- Blow, wind, blow!
Come on.
The wind is getting stronger.
Let-Let -
Let's go to my grotto!
This way!
Proceed in an orderly fashion to the basement!
- To the basement!
- Do not push!
Please don't panic!
There's no need to panic!
- Down here to the grotto.
- All bodies to the basement!
- Don't be hysterical.
- It goes up!
Baby, then it comes down!
Oh, my God.
I think we have a hysterical woman here!
All right, single file!
Do not run!
Do not push!
- Careful!
It's fine!
Do not panic!
- You have to go to the cellar!
- I'm going up to see Mother.
I'll be down in a minute.
- Crushed between!
Lord, that seems like it's going to be quite a st -
Can you believe it?
I've missed you already.
Mackenzie.
You shouldn't be in the ladies' room.
Tulip, my dearest.
Oh, Mackenzie.
Mackenzie, we're-we're just being so foolhardy.
All able-bodied male volunteers - You!
You!
We must go on meeting the rest of our lives.
- Huh?
Just
- Just a minute!
Mrs. Brenner, I'm sorry.
This is an emergency.
Everyone must go down to the cellar immediately.
We have an impending tornado.
- I'll just check this room.
- No.
Someone's in there.
You can't go in there.
- But I must!
- No, uh, you can't.
They're-They're sick.
They're-Yeah.
- Would you please hurry up.
- Come on!
Hurry up!
This is an emergency.
Everyone must go down to the cellar.
And I have to use these facilities.
Could you help me?
I seem to have lost my earring someplace.
I can't find it anywhere.
- Go to the cellar and wait -
- No, I can't go down without my earring.
- My husband would kill me.
- I'm sure we'll find it.
- We can always find another earring.
- Not like this.
- Wait a minute.
Is that it under your foot?
- Oh!
Did you hear that?
- What?
- That noise.
- Oh, it's thunder.
Of course.
- Did you lose an earring too?
- No.
Then how come you got your hand over your ear?
Ladies, there's a tornado.
I urge you to follow me to safety in the cellar.
Oh, will you please look after that person?
- Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen, quiet!
Quiet!
May I have your attention, please?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency!
- Quiet, everybody!
Ladies and gentlemen, I will be passing out among you... aromatic ammonia capsules... for inhalation only... to prevent or treat fainting.
- God!
Nurse!
Nurse!
- Nurse!
- Yes?
- Where's Dr. Meecham?
- Uh, Dr. Meecham?
I think he went, uh, uh -
You looking for me, Toni?
Jules, it's Mother.
I think she's -
I'm sorry, Toni.
I'm afraid she's gone.
I just came in here to check on her.
She smiled, kind of waved at me... and I thought she was saying "hello".
It was good-bye.
Now, Jules,you just calm down.
I'll take care of everything.
Now, you go down and look after Regina.
She needs you.
Regina.
Yeah.
And don't tell her!
I want to be the one to tell the family.
Tulip, listen to me.
There is something you have got to know.
- Candice, lay off.
All right?
- It is important!
This is a family crisis.
It's horrible.
What on earth are you talking about?
Brace yourself, Tulip.
Buffy is impregnated by Dino.
What are you saying?
I know it sounds awful, but it is true.
Your daughter is carrying Dino's baby.
My -
Is that all?
Tulip Ruteledge Brenner.
Candice, I think it's awful sweet of you to want to bring me this news... but I just don't see anything to get that excited about.
Children are walkin' down the aisle pregnant every day of the week.
These are new times.
We are living in a restless age.
That's all.
Let's not let the inclemency of this weather deprive us of peace.
- What the hell happened to you?
- I was in the powder room.
Join me in singing "Heavenly Sunlight." Okay?
Heavenly sunlight Heavenly sunlight
Flooding my soul with glory divine
Heavenly sunlight Heavenly sunlight
Hallelujah Jesus is mine
Tulip, join us.

- Hallelujah Jesus is mine
I
- I have an aunt - My Aunt Ina -
She lives in Tallahassee.
Tallahassee?
That's not very far from where I live in Palm Beach.
I know.
And it's been a real long time since I paid her a visit.
Tallahassee?
Sounds like heaven.
Well, then do you -
Heavenly sunlight Heavenly sunlight
- Flooding my soul with glory divine
- This oughta give you a lift.
- Okay.
Fill 'er up.
- Dino, come on.
- What?
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
Oh, my God!
You stepped on my other foot!
Course, you could always have "Ramrod" Reedley Roots stand in for you.
- Maybe Muffin's painting turned him around.
- Reedley?
- I wouldn't bet on it.
- Why?
What's wrong with him?
- Hallelujah, Jesus is mine
- He's gay.
- Shit.
- Heavenly sunlight
- Ooh.
You never told me that.
Tell me where.
Well, uh, there's a... small motel right across from the Dairy Queen.
Dairy Queen.
That sounds perfect.
- When, Tulip?
When can we meet?
Oh, God, Mackenzie.
Tulip, tell me when we can meet.
Two weeks from tonight, 6:00.
Oh, rapture!
- Two weeks from tonight?
It's done.
Hallelujah God is mine
Heavenly sunlight
See?
I bent my antenna hitting one of those kids.
I could have used that the other day.
All right, men, we got ourselves a little outside
- Get that out of my face.
- I'm instituting emergency room closure procedures.
- Gotcha, chief.
Powder room is secure.
We are now entering the hallway -
Red alert.
Unidentified person in the gift room.
Possible "B" and "E".
You've got a what?
Well, handle it, Redford!
You're trained to handle those things!
Lombardo, reconnoiter.
[Speaks Italian] Corelli.
Luigi!
Luigi!

- Excuse me.
- I know you probably don't smoke, but do you have a cigarette?
- Oh!
Of course.
Which would you like?
Tobacco for your lungs... or a mind for your dreams?
Hallelujah Jesus is mine
- Heavenly sunlight Heavenly sunlight
- You're gonna be all right.
Good work, Redford, Lombardo.
- Momentito.
- He's a foreigner, all right.
- Here's his passport.
- Momento.
- Gotta clean you up real good.
- [Speaking Italian, Weeping]
"Dino Corelli"?
Well, how do you do.
We've got an impostor on our hands.
- Take it easy.
Oh, that's not necessary.
- Brother -
- Hold it.
Hold it.
- Let me see that.
- Please don't interfere with this investigation, son.
- We're experts in these matters.
- Are you?
Well, Mr. Expert Investigator...
I'll have you know that this Dino Corelli... happens to be the brother of Mr. Luigi Corelli... your employer.
- What?
- That's right, you bloody idiot.
But I'm gonna let you explain this personally to Mr. Corelli.
- Wait a minute -
- Stupid fool.
Jesus Christ.
Shit, shit, shit!
Ladies and gentlemen, the bride has announced to her bridesmaids... that she's going upstairs to change her clothes.
Now, halfway up the stairs she tosses her bridal bouquet to the bridesmaids...
Mr. Corelli, there's a bit of a problem.
to symbolically epitomize the virginal state from which she is departing.
[Speaking Italian] It's impossible.
In the laundry.
The bouquet is almost always made of white flowers.
Buffy is impregnated.
Impregnated?
What the hell is the matter with you?
Are you nuts?
I swear to God it's true, Snooks.
The whole family knows.
- Well, who did it?
- Dino!
It was Dino that did it.
That's what everyone's sayin'.
- Jesus Christ.
David, get our people together.
As soon as this is over, we're gonna have a family meeting.
Of course, in the strictest of old-fashioned weddings... only unmarried girls could be bridesmaids.
So may I just suggest to those of you bridesmaids who are married... not to attempt to catch the bouquet.
I have a great idea.
Oh, Miss Farmer!
Come on!
Maybe you'll be the lucky one.
You wouldn't have to work so h - Oh, dear, I'm very sorry.
This is for unmarried females.
I saw a ring.
Oh, the lady with the horse.
You step right in here now.
Get right in the front.
- I'm sure the bride will be very happy to see you.
- Oh, I'm sure she will.
- Are we ready?
- Uh, just about.
Settle down, girls, and good luck.
- All right, Rita.
- Who's going to be the lucky girl?
- Ohh!
- Oh, my -
Oh, it's Flo Farmer!
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
Yes!
I told her to go over there -
Should we go to the greenhouse now?
- Test your reflexes.
- Where is he?
- [Dino Wailing] - [Speaks Italian]
- They did it, Mr. Corelli!
Animals!
- Ah, Dino!
- Luigi!
- You son of a bitch.
- Huh?
- [Speaking Italian]
[Both Shouting In Italian]
Jesus, Luigi!
I just patched him up!
- I don't care!
Let him bleed!
[Italian]
[Italian]
[Italian Continues]
In
- In English, Luigi.
English!
I want that son of a bitch out of here immediately!
For Christ's sake, he's your own brother.
I could lose everything!
You know the arrangement.
I live here with Regina as long as no member of my family... sets foot in this house.
Luigi, Nettie's gone now.
She's dead.
The arrangement doesn't hold anymore.
There are no conditions.
You're in charge!
You're right.
I -
- Yeah.
I am in charge.
- Right.
I
- I make the rules.
Right.
My brother, come here.
- Come here.
- [Speaking Italian]
[Italian]
Uh, Randolph!
Bring me some wine, please!
- [Italian]
My wine, please!
We must celebrate the arrival of my -
- Aah!
- Scus;
of my own little brother!
- I'll drink to that!
- Dino Corelli!
Come stai?
[Italian]
[Singing In Italian]
Tulip, get in here!
Move your ass!
Matthew, close that door.
Buffy, I am gonna ask you a question... and I'm just gonna ask it the once.
Are you -
Did you have relations with your sister's husband?
- Oh, my God.
- Answer me, damn it!
Don't give me that silent routine.
I know you can talk!
Did you?
Are you impregnated - Damn you, Candice.
You told me downstairs that it was Muffin who was pregnant!
- I said it was Buffy!
- Shut up!
Are you pregnant with his baby?
- Jesus!
- Goddamn it.
My Lord.
My baby.
What are you gonna do?
What the hell can I do?
She's pregnant with his goddamn baby.
I sure as hell ain't gonna let him marry Muffin.
- Snooks, please -
- Dad, he's already married.
But it's void.
The marriage vows were violated.
Will you just butt out.
This doesn't concern you.
Hold it a second.
She's right.
You can't lie about a thing like this.
It's too damn big.
- We're gonna have to have this marriage annulled.
- Just like that, huh?
You can't.
I won't let you.
I mean, my God, what would the Goddards think?
- The Goddards?
You know, that big fat man that's always following around Aunt Tulip.
- What the hell have they got to do with this?
- I meant the Corellis!
The hell with the Corellis!
I don't give a damn what they think about it!
It's them and their goddamn snot-nosed kid that's got us into this trouble.
He's foolin' around even before he's gone off on his honeymoon!
Listen to me.
What about all our friends back home?
We gotta think about them.
Everybody in town knows.
We're gonna be laughed right out of Louisville!
Simmer down, woman.
I can take care of that.
- We'll just go away for a month or two.
- I can't go away.
- What do you mean, you can't?
I promised Aunt Ina I-I was gonna, uh, pay her a visit in two weeks.
- Well, go some other time.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
- I can't!
Jesus H. Christ, Tulip!
Do you realize what we're talking about here?
Do you have any idea what the hell we're talking about?
What about an abortion?
- Sure.
- What?
- What about an abortion?
- I can't believe my ears!
- You're talking about murder!
- It's a possibility!
That's all I'm sayin;!
- I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll try anything.
- You'll try anything?
- Tulip Ruteledge Brenner, bite your tongue!
- Lay off of me, Candice!
- I have had it with you today!
- The two of you, shut up!
Can it!
Can it, Candice!
- Can it!
Hughie,you know that Dr. What's-His-Name -
- Meecham.
Go get him.
And get Dino in here too!
Hurry up!
That little dago's got some explainin' to do!
Y-Y-You don't need me anymore.
I
- I
- I, uh -
Good-bye, Buffy.
Uh, sit down, all of you.
I have something important to share with you, something not at all pleasant -
Toni, if this is about me, I'm not staying.
It's my own business what I do with my own personal life.
Clarice, shut up and listen.
I have no intention of talking about your personal life.
- I don't give a damn about your personal life.
- Please, you two!
- What is it you want to talk to us about?
- Money, of course.
- My sister's money.
- Aunt Bea!
God!
Don't deny it, dear.
You can't wait to get your hands on that estate... so you can buy more factories and employ more illegal aliens.
Shut up, Aunt Bea!
I'm not going to even dignify that with a denial.
I can assure you that I did not bring you all here to discuss material things.
All right, Aunt Toni.
You tell us, and we'll listen.
Thank you, Daphne.
I have some news.
It's about Mother.
She -
- Dead.
- Regina!
Mama is dead.
Will you stop putting words in my mouth and let me finish what I have to say!
- She is dead, isn't she?
- No!
Well -
I mean, she wasn't when I saw her earlier.
But then later I went to visit her and -
Oh, God, why is this so difficult?
Oh, my dear Toni.
Courage.
We're with you.
Then... she seemed fine.
She even smiled a little and waved.
I thought it was hello.
But it was really good-bye.
- It was tres thoughtful of you to tell us, Toni.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Toni dear, remember, whatever is, is.
Toni, I'm sorry I yelled.
- Oh, darling.
What can I say?
I know, dear.
It's never easy.
Where did Jules go?
- Thank you for letting us know, Aunt Toni.
- Daphne dearest.
Look, why don't you stay here at least two weeks.
- It'll do you good.
- Oh, Mac.
You're so understanding.
Seems like a perfectly healthy young girl to me.
We know that, for Christ's sakes.
What about the abortion?
- Snooks -
- One word, Candice, and it's your ass!
Ordinarily I'm in favor of'em, but in this case, well, four months is pushing it... even for me.
So I suggest that you, uh, go ahead and have this baby.
- Praise the Lord.
- Shit.
Hi, everybody.
I -
I was just upstairs changing.
If you'll excuse me, uh, I'm probably needed in another ward.
Here, son.
You, uh, might need this more than I do.
Well, here's, uh -
What the hell have you got to say for yourself?
Come on.
This better be good.
We all know what you did.
You took advantage of my daughter, Buffy, and you got her pregnant.
I wanna know what the hell you intend to do about it.
Wait a minute, Dad - Sir, I didn't
- I wasn't -
Don't you try to fast-talk me, you little shit!
I'll wring your goddamn neck!
Now, did you sleep with my daughter, Buffy?
Snooks, just stop it.
You know it isn't true.
Yes or no, goddamn it.
Well,yes, sir, but - but...
I wasn't -
I mean -
Well... just about everyone in the barracks did too, sir.
Buffy, is it true?
Have there been other ones?
Oh, dear Jesus, have mercy on us.
- How many?
- Don't, Snooks.
You'd better tell me right now.
How many?
Buffy, stop it.
That's enough.
Get out.
Get the hell out of my sight.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.
Well, what the hell's everybody standing around for?
Not a goddamn thing we can do about it now.
Hell of a wedding.
Again.
You know, I've -
I've been married four times... and I never thought I was gonna do it again.
- At least I didn't think so.
Well, I never have been married.
- Never?
- Never.
Unless you can call being married to a lawn mower a marriage.
There's, uh -
There's nothing wrong with you, is there?
No.
No, there's nothing wrong with me.
Well, uh...
- have you ever given some real thought, maybe... to a trip to New Jersey, huh?
- You have some hedges that need trimming, my dear?
I got a whole lawn that needs trimming'.
That sounds good.
How do you feel?
I don't know.
Here, have some more of this coffee.
Come on, now.
Come on.
Come on.
Drink up.
- Ow.
- Drink it.
- Drink it!
All of it.
I want you to sober up, because you are not getting out ofhere... unless you can walk a straight line.
You are not driving a car that distance in this condition.
Now you oughta feel better.
- Ohh!
- Just stay where you are.
Just gonna get you into that shower and sober.
Then I can wash my hands of this whole thing.
Goddamn, Corelli.
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh, good.
- Mrs. Corelli.
I sure hope I get used to that funny name.
But I do love it.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- Oh, what's that horror?
- Oh, that's my brother Hughie's graduation ring.
You know, something borrowed, something blue.
Well, he kinda loaned it to me forever.
- Very quaint.
- Yeah.
You know, in spite of all the various semi-disastrous mishaps... that we've had...
I think I'll cherish the memory of this wedding... more than any other wedding I've ever done.
Well, I know I will.
I should hope you will.
Thank you.
You're the loveliest bride I've ever had.
Well, thank you.
You know, I just hope Dino's not too drunk.
- He'll be all right.
- You think?
Well, thank you...
for everything.
- Can I-Your hair is -
- Can't have you going away looking like that.
- No.
And I think this should be... out of the dress.
You're such a child.
Well, thank you.
My brides are the only children I'll ever have.
- Thanks.
- Please don't misunderstand.
I'll see you before you leave.
Dino?
Dino, you ready to go?
- Come on.
- Down here, man.
- It's coming.
- This stuff is dynamite.
Don't take more than a couple hits unless you wanna get really wrecked.
- That's gonna hold me all night.
- I don't wanna go back there.
- Oh, wow!
Hey, man -
It's kinda harsh, man.
Oh, how wonderful!
They're leaving!
Rita!
Rita!
The newlyweds are leaving!
- Call the guests out!
Come on, everyone!
- Bye!
So long!
Good luck to you!
- Oh, come out and wave, children!
Wanted to give 'em a few tips.
[Luigi, Dino Speaking Italian]
Oh, isn't it wonderful?
Oh!
Oh, children, get right in the front!
Come on!
- Can finally rest in peace now.
- Oh, Lord!
- I didn't get a chance to kiss Muffin good-bye.
- Neither did I.
Have them guys bring our cars around, boy.
The name is Randolph.
Yeah.
We got two of'em.
- What are you doing?
Are you leaving already?
- Yeah, we're going.
- I didn't even introduce my brother.
- Well, I have to go.
- Hey, join the fun.
- I've had all the fun I can take, thank you.
Hughie?
Hughie.
I got the cars coming around.
We're going home now.
Put the Ruteledges in the second car.
We'll go in the first car.
- Should I go get Buffy?
- No.
Let her go with them.
I don't wanna see her anymore.
No, no, no, no.
Wait, now.
I think we get in this-Wait!
Wait, wait.
Help get the children into the car.
- That's good.
- Oh, thank you very much.
It was awfully nice meeting you, Mr. Goddard.
I do hope we see each other sometime in the near future.
Well, I'm looking forward to when our paths cross again.
Until that time, tally, uh -
- Hassee.
- It was so lovely to meet you.
- Thank you.
You did such a good job.
Thank you.
It was a wonderful wedding.
Watch your dress.
- Bye-bye.
- I hope your mama feels better real soon.
- We'll catch up with you.
- All right, honey.
Okay.
- Bye!
- Bye now!
Bye now!
- Bye-bye!
- [Speaking Italian]
Okay, everybody inside.
The party goes on.
Actually, the party starts.
[Speaking Italian]
[Speaking Italian]
[Italian]
[Italian]
- I don't speak Spanish.
- [Italian]
Oh, she's great.
- She's gonna die.
- Good night, Miss Farmer.
You ever work in a woman's prison, Lombardo?
- Uh, no, I haven't.
Have you?
- Yeah.
It's good.
It's a lot of action.
It's a lot of fun.
- But the food's not as good as these little birds.
- It's a life of commitment... deprivation, service.
I'm not particularly a religious man, Bishop... but we both know there are no atheists in the foxholes.
Am I right, or am I wrong?
This may surprise you, sir... but I took a - a vow of celibacy... when I got into this line of work.
It wasn't mandatory.
I just did it out of commitment.
- Russell?
- Shelby, do not move.
Russell, are you out here?
Come on!
Russell?
Russell!
- Russell!
Muffin?
It's them!
It's Muffin!
Sir!
There's no one in there alive!
- Oh, my God!
- Get them out ofhere.
- Muffin!
I can't leave my baby alone!
- My God!
It's my daughter!
It's too dangerous.
No use getting yourselfkilled too, sir.
- If I can get close, I can pull her out!
- No.
No,you can't.
- Don't look.
No.
No.
- David!
David!
- It's all right!
God is punishing me!
- Come, come.
Jesus is with us.
Jesus is with us.
- Oh, God!
- Where is Buffy?
Daddy, Buffy's back at the house!
Get in the car!
- Buffy!
- Get in the car, Daddy!
- Please!
Daddy, get in the car!
- No, no!
- What do we do, Hughie?
- Pray, for God's sake!
We'll call you at the hotel!
We're going to the Corellis.
Talbot, get us back to the Corelli house.
[Dino Giggles, Speaks Italian]
[Singing In Italian]
[Luigi Joins In]
[Italian, Laughing]
Oh, Mama.
- [Italian] - [Continues, Italian]
Mr. Corelli!
- Mama, I'm gonna put you here.
Where the hell is everybody?
Daddy, just shut up and stay with Mama.
I'm gonna get Dr. Meecham.
- Mr. Corelli?
- Yes?
Darling,you're back!
- Dr. Meecham, could you look at my mama?
- What's wrong?
She's dead.
- Tulip is dead?
- What?
No, Muffin's dead.
Dino's dead.
They've both been killed in a car accident on the freeway!
- Snooks, what happened?
- You did this.
- Is it true?
- It's your fault!
You gave them that car!
- Goddamn foreign car!
- What are you talking about?
- You drink too much too!
My goddamn Muffin is dead because of your son!
Will you stop yelling!
For God's sake!
- You're a guest in this house!
- Don't give me that "guest"!
I paid $20,000 for this goddamn wedding, and your phony friends didn't even show up!
- Well, if that's true, you will be amply repaid.
- Bullshit.
Because our family does not take contributions from truck drivers.
Oh, yeah, I'm a truck driver, but I can buy and sell your ass.
I made five million last year -
Stop, you-you bastards!
- Stop it!
- Will you shut up!
Will you all shut up!
They're dead!
Let's
- Let's calm down.
You-You tell us wh-what happened.
We were in the car driving back to the hotel... and there was this gasoline truck jackknifed in the middle of the road.
- And Dino's car was underneath it.
- The license plate-And it was on fire.
- [Speaking Italian]
And the cops said that nobody was left alive in the car.
And I saw Muffin's clothes all on the floor.
Muff -
- Jules!
- He's having a seizure.
Oh, darling, oh, darling.
It's all right.
Mama?
Mama?
Muffin!
Where is Dino?
- Mama!
- Where is my boy?
- Where is Dino?
Where is he?
- Did you see my boy?
- I think he's upstairs.
- Dino!
- What?
- He's here!
- Yes, I'm -
- What?
- [Speaking Italian]
- I was upstairs.
I passed out.
- Dino!
- Hey-hey!
- He's here!
He never left!
- Of course!
They never left!
They are safe!
[Italian]
- What's happened?
- Nothing.
- I was upstairs.
I passed out upstairs.
- Dino!
- Dino!
Why are you all so excited?
Dino, it's 'cause you were upstairs in the shower with Reedley.
- Who took the car?
- What car?
- I had to sober up.
- I gave Briggs the keys.
- It must have been Briggs.
- And Tracy!
Yes.
Briggs and Tracy, they -
- Briggs took Dino's car?
- Yes.
He had no right to do that.
- What are you talking about?
You're insane!
- Come on, Dino.
He has his motorbike and Tracy has her horse.
- We must notify the families.
- [Speaking Italian]
[Speaking Italian]
We must notify the families!
They have a right to know!
- Let's have some champagne!
Come on!
Captain, you call Briggs's family.
- You knew him.
- Not really.
What
- Dino.
- [Italian] - [Italian]
- They are mad, yes.
Or worse than mad.
Much worse than mad.
Oh, boy.
Let's celebrate!
Here, nursey.
Have a little drink, huh?
Where the hell are them waiters?
Need something'to drink.
[Meecham] You got a little ash on your chest again.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Gotta stop doing that.
Tulip, my sweet baby.
We must talk.
Today, uh, temptation was thrust upon me... in the form of you... and, uh, I succumbed.
And so I was punished for my evil thoughts.
- Just to the brim, please.
- God took my baby away from me.
He's given me a second chance.
What I'm trying to tell you is, uh, I won't be... meeting my Aunt Ina in Tallahassee, ever.
Just creamed it right there on the highway.
Big oil rig.
So, Nettie, you can rest now.
And I'm glad.
It's been a long time.
For me too - 22 years in obedient service.
Even you will agree to that, I hope.
I think I kept my promise - our bargain.
Nobody here knows who I really am.
I'm even getting confused about my name.
Luigi?
Louis?
Louie?
F.O.G.?
Giuseppe Garibaldi?
It's very confusing, Nettie.
But -
But the work is done.
Mmm.
Your children are secure.
Mine are grown.
Dino is married.
So there- there is nothing left for me to do here.
Nettie, I -
I -
I think I'm going to take my leave.

Ciao.
Shh.
Ciao.
Dino!

You know, weddings are the happiest events I could possibly dream of.
And yet somehow, when they're over, it's always so sad.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
You must have had a beautiful wedding.
Did you?
Oh, yeah, I had a great wedding'.
Uh, it wasn't anything like this.
We were real poor.
But it was beautiful.
And my husband, Russell, looked so handsome.
All the girls were after him... but he picked me to marry.
Yeah, I think that was the happiest day of my life.
But you're right - when it's over it gets real sad.
Nanu-nanu.

Ow.
Ow.
Eer, ow, ooh.
Ah, hah, hah.
That's enough.
I'll tell you what you want to know.
I don't believe you.
Don't you get haircuts on Ork?
No, we try to avoid them because of the noggachomps.
"Noggachomps"?
What's that?
It's a small green creature about this big.
We put them on our heads and let them graze.
They're vicious little animals.
Kind of ( snarling ).
That sounds dangerous.
Oh, only if you fall asleep in the chair.
Occasionally a maverick will get loose from the herd and run down your neck.
That's why we have to set traps in our shorts.
What a horrible system.
Mindy, you don't understand Orkan philosophy.
If something works, don't fix it.
Well, there, you look much better.
Ah.
You're all done.
Ooh, ah, I feels worse, though.
How much do I owe you?
Where did you get the money?
I baby-sat for Eugene.
Here, six big ones.
Well, you just keep the money.
The haircut is on me.
No, it's on me.

Hello?
Hello.
Brad.
( nasally ):
Hi, there.
How are you?
Well, it's so nice to hear from you again.
Nice to hear from you, too.
I thought you were in law school somewhere.
I'm out now...
Ow!
Well, congratulations.
No big deal.
Uh...
Here, go water yourself.
Oh.
Well, sure, that would be fine.
I'd love to have dinner.
Sure.
All right, 7:30 it is.
Okay, great, I'll see you then.
Bye.
Mork, I have a date.
Don't tell me...
June 2, 1852.
No, I mean this guy that I really used to like is back in town and we're going to have dinner tonight.
Oh, good, where are we going?
"Where are we going?"
Oh, boy.
Mork, you know I've been thinking.
You and I have...
I think we've been seeing too much of each other lately.
Well, then all you have to do is close one eye.
No, I mean, I think you should get out and meet more people.
You know, see more things.
Oh, I get it.
Two's company, "we's" a crowd.
Oh, no.
No, not that, necessarily.
I mean, for your own development you really should get out and meet more people.
Like who?
Are you ready to start the inventory, Cora?
Certainly, Fredzo.
And don't call me Fredzo.
It sounds like a detergent.
Yes.
Now, let's see, there are one, two, three, four, five, six
Meat Loaf albums.
Six Meat Loaf.
Mm-hmm.
One, two, three, four...
Nine Bread albums.
Nine Bread.
This isn't an inventory.
It's a grocery list.
Hi, Grandma.
Oh.
Oh, hello, darling.
Daddy.
How's the nicest, sweetest, most wonderful father in the world?
Suspicious.
Now you think I want something from you?
Is that how little you think of your own daughter?
Well, as a matter of fact,
I have something for you.
Two free tickets to tonight's basketball game.
You're taking Mork.
That's the nicest thing you've given me since the chicken pox.
Fredzo, it's only 11:00.
You're not usually a wiener before noon.
See, Dad, I need Mork out of the house tonight.
I have a date.
With a human?
That's wonderful.
Yeah, well, it won't be wonderful if he comes to pick me up at my place and finds Mork there.
That's why you just have got to take him to that game.
But Mindy, I detest basketball.
Oh, but Dad, I haven't had a date since Mork moved in.
Every time the phone rings,
I almost hope it's heavy breathing.
I didn't hear that.
Basketball.
How can anybody sit through a game that has so much dribbling?
Well, if I can't date other men
I guess I'll just have to settle down with Mork and have cute little green babies that drink their formula with their finger.
Free throw!
One-on-one!
Jump shot!
Dunk shot!
I'll go!
I'll go!
MINDY:
That was such a nice dinner, Brad.
Here's to the old times.
Here's to the new times.
All right.
Brad, can I ask you something kind of dumb?
Sure.
How come you never asked me out when we were in high school?
Because I was a jerk.
Yeah, you were.
I wish I'd kept in touch with you, Mindy.
You're a wonderful girl.
Yeah, I am.
Greetings!
Mork!
( humming ) What are you doing here?
Dribbling.
Oh, is this the guy you used to like?
Mork, this is Brad Jackson.
Brad, this is my friend Mork.
Hi.
I'm glad to meet you.
Nanu-nanu.
Certainly.
So is "Mork" your first or last name?
Yes.
Did you enjoy having food with Mindy?
Yes, I did.
So do I.
Everybody enjoys having food with Mindy.
So, did the basketball game end early?
I guess so.
After about an hour, your father stopped it.
My father stopped it?
Yeah, he said, "This has gone on long enough."
Oh, Mork, what did you do?
Oh, lots of things.
I had a great time.
Ever been to a basketball game?
My favorite part was when I got to dance.
You danced?
Oh, yeah, that part at the beginning, where they played the music, everyone stood up and
♪ Oh, say can you see?
♪
He's a great kidder.
Then some man asked me to pass him his coffee, so I did.
He didn't catch it, though.
That's too bad.
But your father caught it with his pants.
Then it was his turn to dance.
Then we went to a place called the rest room.
I didn't get any rest there, though.
I had a terrible seat.
Couldn't even see the game.
We went back and some woman asked me to hold her seat, so I....
Never mind.
I know, that's when they made us leave.
Uh, are you a friend of the family?
No, I live here.
Live here?
Oh, Brad, see, it's not what you think.
Mindy, he lives here with you, and you go out with other men?
Oh, yeah, but you see, uh...
Mork, Brad and I aren't quite finished yet.
Oh, I see, you're still hungry.
Mork...
I'll whip up my special dessert.
No, Mork.
Oh, for you, le monde, mama.
( barks ) Stay.
Maybe I should leave.
No, Brad.
No, Brad, stay.
We'd like to get to know you better.
Mork.
( Mork whistling, humming )
You see, Mork and I live together, but I still go out with whoever I want.
I mean...
Mindy, I...
I don't know what your idea of a relationship is, but I-I'm not a swinger.
Well, neither am I.
Oh, swinger.
Baseball.
( swishing sound )
How about them Broncos?
Brad, I'd really like to see you again.
Oh, we'll get together again.
Soon.
Hey, wait.
You missed the bologna sundae.
Your eyes are leaking.
Are they?
That means something has hurt you, doesn't it?
Yes.
Brad did something, that slimemunger.
I'll follow him to the ends of the universe.
I'll vaporize his entrails.
No, Mork.
It's not what Brad did.
It's that
Brad misunderstood our relationship.
That's what made me sad.
Ever since you moved in, guys have stopped asking me out.
And then when somebody does finally like me, like Brad, well...
He think that you and I are...
Lovelings.
Yeah.
And then when I tell them we're not, they either don't understand or they don't believe the situation, so I end up not going anywhere, I never go out.
I guess I'm feeling kind of lonely.
It's all because I'm staying here, isn't it?
No, it's not your fault.
It was my idea in the first place to have you move in.
I just have to work this out.
Night.
( door closes )
Hm.
Leaking.
Come on, Mork, get up.
Breakfast.
What do you want, pancakes?
Waffles?
Gladiolas?
Come on, you lazy Orkan.
MORK:
"Mindy, I know you are sad
"because people think you and I are lovelings.
"I don't want you to be sad anymore,
"so I'm going away.
"If people from Ork knew how to love,
"I'm sure I would love you.
"But I don't even understand what love is.
Love, Mork."
You're doing that very well, Eugene.
Grandma Hudson, thank you for letting me work today.
I need the money so I can buy my mom a birthday present.
Oh, well, that's all right, Eugene.
What are you going to buy her?
The best present in the whole world.
A catcher's mitt.
Wow, that's great.
And it'll go so well with those shin guards you gave her last year.
Oh, say, Eugene, uh, call me if any customer comes in.
Okay.
Guess who?
Uh...
Stevie Wonder?
What's happening, Mork?
!
Hey, plasma, what it is?
What you doing with the suitcase?
You taking a vacation?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
If you were taking a vacation, where would you go?
I've always wanted to see France.
Kay-o; dosvedanya.
Or maybe the Swiss Alps.
Hey, make up my mind.
It depends on how much money you want to spend.
Uh, six smackers.
You can't go to the Alps with six dollars.
Then France it is.
Arrivederci.
♪ Or France, either. ♪
Hey, bummer.
Are you running away?
How can you tell?
It's written all over your face.
Shazbot...
I've broken out in words.
Psst.
Can you keep a secret?
I don't want you to tell Mindy where I'm going.
You see, I've, I've been a lot of trouble to her.
Man, you aren't going far on six dollars.
You can't even get a place to sleep unless you stay in a flophouse.
Oh.
Sounds perfect for a flop like me.
Well, there are some places on Mission Street.
But they're awful seedy.
"Seedy." Oh, I love horticulture.
Hello, Eugene.
Good morning, Mr. McConnell.
What's this?
Looks like a suitcase.
Yes.
Well, somebody must have left it here.
Maybe I better open it up and see if I can find the name of the owner.
( making soft ray-gun sounds )
Good heavens!
How did that happen?
I don't know.
( blowing )
I told you never to sit on my throne!
I leave you two alone for five minutes, and the whole place goes to pot!
You scoff?
You don't believe?
I tell you, the men from Venus are coming down to take us to their planet.
They arrive...
Labor Day.
Then they're going to blow up the whole world!
And you sit there eating a sandwich?
Where's the passenger list?
There's only room on the escape ship for... 1,000 people, and so far we've lined up... three.
Pressure.
I've been walking the streets all day, trying to find recruits.
My feet are killing me.
Gad, those make my thighs sweat.
Good-bye.
I saw your signs outside...
the Friends of Venus?
I thought I'd stop by to see if there's anyone here I know.
Do you know any of the Friends of Venus?
I know some people from Venus.
I know one guy who's kind of cute if you're into short and fuzzy.
His name is ( violent sniff ).
Gesundheit.
No, no, that's his name.
See, he's got a wife and a litter, and their names are... ( raspberry, squeak and cheeks flapping )
I'd hate to be the child stuck with a name like... ( cheeks flapping )
A believer.
A true believer.
What's not to believe?
You believe in people from outer space?
Shazbot.
Nanu-nanu.
Precisely.
My name is Exidor.
I'd like you to join me.
Well, if you insist.
No.
I mean, join our group, be one of us.
Us?
Oh...
Well, right now, you see,
I'm looking for a fliphouse to flap in.
That's flophouse.
Oh, flip, flop... whatever.
You can stay here with us.
We'll all work together.
Oh, work.
I finally got a job and a place to flip out all at once.
Oh, Mindy will be proud of me.
Mindy.
Heavy sigh.
Oh, Daddy, Mork ran away.
You've just got to help me find him.
Oh. well, look, honey, I don't know why he left, but maybe it's the best thing.
No, it's not, Dad!
Mork is like a child here.
He shouldn't be out in the world alone.
He has no concept of trouble or danger.
Oh, Dad, if anything happened to him,
( sobbing ):
I don't know what I'd do.
I don't want him to go.
All right honey, okay, take it easy, take it easy.
Now, I'll help you find him.
But where would he go?
Oh, I don't know.
I've been looking all morning.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, I just remembered something.
This morning when I came in, there was a shiny metal suitcase right in the middle of the store.
Mork has a shiny suitcase.
And then the albums fell, and, and...
Eugene...
I don't know nothing.
I think we've uncovered a clue.
Mork, this is my philosophy for the Friends of Venus.
I want you to study it and memorize it so that you can go out with me and convert the non-believer.
I'll study hard and let you know when I'm ready.
( high-pitched hiccup )
I'm ready.
Very well, on your feet.
Uh...
let's pretend that, uh, I am a non-believer, and you try and convert me.
Hey, you, non-believer.
Good start.
But we need more power in your voice, and more conviction.
Oh, I see.
Frey-und...!
I have need of your attention.
Friend, do you realize that the Venusians are coming down to Earth?
But they're not coming here on Veterans Day, not on April Fool-es Day, but on Labor Day, Labor Day, Labor Day.
Can you hear me, friend?
I hear you!
Are you ready now?
Can I get a nanu-nanu?
Nanu-nanu.
Thank you, friend.
Do you realize, friends, what they're coming here to do?
Because they've come down here to blow the Earth to smithereens!
But it's not that bad, friend.
Because they're sending a ship down here to save 1,000 of us, and they're making a list, and they're checking it twice.
Now, friend, now, you can either stay down here, in your disco, drug-infested inferno, or come up to Venus, and have your very own Venusian condominimum, with hot and cold running champagne and underwater dancing.
You must apply now!
Mork!
Mork... that was beautiful!
Why can't you be more like him?
!
But... there's something's missing.
What we need is more of your experiences with the Venusians here on Earth.
I didn't meet them on Earth;
I met them on Venus.
You've been there?
Oh, yes, I've been to all the planets in your solar system.
Mars, Mercury, Pluto?
!
Oh, don't ever go to Pluto;
it's a Mickey Mouse planet.
You see, Exidor, I have something to explain to you.
The Venusians aren't coming to blow up the Earth.
They're not?
No, you see, their technology isn't prepared for space travel.
It isn't?
No, their highest invention so far has been the garbage can.
It is?
And the only reason they invented that was to have something to tip over.
Blasphemy!
I had high hopes for you, Mork.
You're crazy.
Mork!
Oh, what a relief.
Mindy, I didn't want you to find me here.
You know, I knew as soon as I saw that Friends of Venus sign,
I knew you'd be here.
I want you to come home with me now.
No, you don't.
You just say that 'cause you feel sorry for me.
Mork, I don't feel sorry for you.
I feel sorry for me.
I don't understand.
When I'm not there, you're free to do as you wish.
You have a home of your own.
No, what I have is an apartment.
It was only a home when there was somebody in it that I cared about.
Me?
But I get in your way;
you told me so.
Oh, I know, and I'm sorry.
I was blaming you because guys stopped asking me out.
And then when one did ask me out...
I know.
I made a real crimluck of myself.
It was my fault.
Mork, I'm a woman, and, and a woman just sometimes needs to be held.
Mmm, that man Brad, you wanted him to hold you.
Well, not him, necessarily.
I really didn't get a chance to find out.
But yeah, every once in a while a little hug really does help get me through the day.
What's a hug?
Oh, you know, like...
Like... like this?
Yeah.
Oh.
Soft.
I can understand how this keeps you going.
It's got me going, and I don't even know what it is.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
( humming )
Mork calling Orson.
Orson... ♪ I am calling you-oo-oo... ♪
ORSON:
What a terrible connection.
Sounds like someone stepped on a frenkle's tail.
Just me reporting from Earth.
And what words of wisdom are you transmitting across the universe today?
I learned how to make a human happy.
I learned... how to give a hug.
And a hug is?
It's when you wrap your arms around a human's body and squeeze.
I thought that's what Earthlings call wrestling.
No, in wrestling, you squeeze a lot harder until they sweat and go "Arrgh!"
They don't sweat and go ( grunting ) when you hug them?
No, they just cuddle and go "Ah!"
Oh, hugging.
Amazing what pleases the primitive tribes.
I'll never understand them.
But Orson?
Yes?
It was good for me, too.
Mork!
Yes, Your Immenseness.
This is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado, until next week.
Nanu-nanu.
She must be holed up in that big hotel.
She's looking for the bones of old queers.
Do you recognise him?
He has a decayed tooth.
He asked for you.
-Wash his hair first.
It must be a skeleton from before Christ.
You're in good shape.
Helm, come down, Brigitte found some real human bones.
Look, Helm.
And there's still a lot of interesting stuff down there.
Save it for dinner.
And call me for the meat, not the bones.
Let go of me.
What do you want from me?
No, let go of me.
I want to go, let go of me.
Help.
Let go of me.
I want to go, let go of me.
I'm not rich, let go of me.
Monsters.
Let go of me.
What do you want from me?
Let me go.
You idiot, let us know if you're going to run off.
You insult her without knowing...
-We're here to find archeological artefacts...
Understood?
I don't give a damn about anything else.
It was here.
There was a car.
Now do you believe me?
It belonged to the woman they took.
They put her in the trunk.
I wanted to do something.
But I had to run away or they would've taken me as well.
I hear a car.
Let's go.
-Follow me.
I don't believe you but I'll follow the tyre tracks.
Come on, little one.
Come, my little puppy.
Let's go.
You naughty thing, don't make me pull.
Well?
Are you coming, my love?
That's the kidnapper's car.
-Holy cow.
And she's in the trunk?
Then it's true.
I told you, I'm not rich.
What do you want to do to me?
Have mercy, let me go.
Incredible!
-Let's call the police.
We've got time, let's see what happens.
What do you mean?
-We need cash for our research.
I want new equipment, recorders, monitors....
Periscope cameras, radios, microphones...
Documented proof.
If they're up to no good in this villa, either we blackmail them...
Or we'll sell the story to the newspapers...
We'll get the money one way or another.
But how?
We've got all the equipment to find out about the dead...
This time we'll use it uncover the perversions of the living.
You can't do that.
That lunatic is serious.
-I don't want any part of this.
He made it to the window.
Let's hope they don't see him.
With the camera in the right place we should see everything.
We will take your virginity.
Yes!
Destroy her mind.
The mysteries of the extra-sensorial...
Feel the dominant power of Astoroph.
The hot womb of this virgin will be sacrificed for you.
And you, virgin priestess...
You will be gloriously and sensationally raped.
No, don't hurt me.
Don't torture me.
No, don't torture me.
Astoroph, look at us.
And listen to us.
Kill her on my body, I want to feel the heat of her blood...
More!
I'm going to the police.
-And I'll beat you.
Try it.
Then I'll sacrifice you to that asshole, Astoroph.
It scares you.
Or does the fear of the raped virgin excite you?
Come on.
Astoroph is watching us.
Don't you feel Astoroph's rapacious little arms around you?
With the varicose veins, and the little drunken leaves.
Yes, yes.
Be brave, Astoroph is watching us.
Astoroph is watching us.
And he enjoys watching the sacrifice.
See how she enjoys it.
Brigitte, the priestess is watching us.
She wants to enjoy it.
Good, your blood is hot, hot.
I like to see you excited like this.
I like it.
How many Astoroph's are on you, how many?
I'll give you all of them, all for you.
Take them, take them.
Do you feel them?
They're all yours.
Take them.
All them, all of them.
Stop.
Stop.
You're both fools.
Let's get out of here.
Why?
-What's got into you?
This is big.
And it got a lot bigger straddling Brigitte.
But a small arrow can puncture any business.
Let's get back to our archeological research, Brigitte.
I'll continue my research here.
I smell a lot of cash.
It's an orchid we shouldn't pick.
-Get out of here.
Not here.
Do you really believe I dress up with a mask in cursed villas?
If you kiss me, I want to love you.
And to still believe you.
I keep thinking someone from that horrible house is watching me.
Leave if you want but I think there's something to see...
I'm going back to the villa.
-I'm scared, let's follow him.
We won't get any rest.
-I don't care, let's go with Helm.
Even if it's dangerous?
-Yes.
That horrible car is always there.
Let's hide here.
I shudder to think what goes on in there.
I don't see Helm anymore.
-Look there.
They're playing.
I don't think so.
Helm is still there.
They must have seen him.
I'm scared, Charlotte.
My God, they've got guns.
What are they doing?
I like it here , Lawrence, by the sea, lillies, orchids, everything!
We're in the game and I want to get to the bottom of it.
Brigitte and I will follow the car they shot at...
You follow the car they used to kidnap the woman.
No, I'm coming with you.
-Shit...
You know how to use the equipment, Brigitte, doesn't.
Put her down.
Can she be identified?
-Not with a little plastic surgery.
With your scapel, if it doesn't cost anything.
It hasn't been disinfected...
But it will do the do job.
You lunatic!
Are you drunk?
Jesus Christ, can't you see I'm a little girl without license plates?
Sorry.
Those two idiots are to blame.
Well?
Do you want to wake up?
Are you leaving just like that?
-I'd stay but I'm in a hurry.
Aren't you going to pay for the damage?
I didn't even touch you.
Okay then...
I'll take your license plate number and play it on the lottery.
They went that way.
-Let's go.
Let's pretend to make love so we don't attract their attention.
Don't be a fool.
-Are you serious?
I'm only messing around but we can't look like we're acting.
Do you want me touch your tits or your ass?
Just do it.
Careful, that monster's arrived.
He looks like the charicature of a killer.
You'll see a lot more up there, but...
I liked what we were doing.
-You liked it, eh?
Pass it to me.
I'll be able to listen in with this.
A friend has come to get me.
-Good, good.
I felt so scared.
They almost killed me.
But you still believe...
-Any suspects?
It just happened.
-No.
I want to see as well.
Help me up.
"...and then, things happen."
"Come on." -"You must believe me."
"You must believe me."
"...near that villa, strange things have happened to me."
In one way or another, with an orchid.
Are you sure about that?
-Yes, if they shoot me.
Say it, if you have doubts?
-It's you who has doubts.
She seems certain but I don't believe any of this nonsense.
Come on, try to give me something specific.
Aren't we pretending to make love?
-Screw the branch, for now.
"Lawrence's behaviour doesn't convince me."
I followed him to the gate of some villa.
I saw Lawrence, or someone who looked like him.
He was wearing a strange hat.
I decided to follow that shadow.
I felt so scared when the gate closed behind me.
But it was too late, I was inside.
It felt like someone was spying on me, but I didn't know who?
But I was looking for Lawrence, just him.
Even a cat tried to scare me.
I felt dizzy and I could smell orchids all around me...
But I didn't see any, not one.
And then...
The door was ajar.
A voice called out in the dark.
"You're marking your fate."
And I managed to get away.
And they let you get away, just like that?
"It can happen, can't it?"
-I'm finding it hard to believe you.
You could investigate, at least?
-That villa doesn't even exist for me.
"So I should be put away..."
"They didn't shoot at me?
The villa doesn't exist?"
"The orchids weren't real?
Just put me away."
"If it makes you happy, I do believe you."
Got you!
They're two sons of bitches, and you make three.
I'm so afraid of dying.
I want the presence of extra terrestrials in me.
I'm not...
My throat burns, it's like a fire.
Fire!
Help me.
Astaroph.
Hold me with your hands.
Servants of Astoroph, kill in the name of Astoroph.
I will burn your orchid.
Remember the name of Parispath.
The woman I sent has already entered into your refuge.
She will drag you to your death.
Astoroph won't help you.
See your fate, priestess.
And you, yourself, will be...
The one to kill the man who who invoked your death.
I die for you.
Astoroph, why?
Why?
I don't want to die like this, Astoroph!
Help me.
Summon me again.
Astoroph!
-I am Parsipath, nothing will save you.
You must die.
I will kill the woman.
You will die, and who is with you will die in your cursed blood.
Your death awaits!
Nothing can save you.
Charlotte, can you hear me?
Why doesn't she answer?
Damn her.
I told her not to run off.
Whether you're listening or not we're coming back to the villa.
We'll meet you by the equipment.
Come on, let's go.
...in those horrible things we also participated in.
I still feel strongly about this, and I keep asking myself...
How is it possible, that while we live with (?
) our freedom we are conditioned beings?
Right, Elizabeth?
I don't understand a word of what I say or do when I'm in a trance, aunt Clarissa.
Lucky you.
-It's just a pass time.
And our predicted deaths are a game of society.
Death is frightening.
If the prophecy is real then so is the woman whose duty it is to kill us.
We should look for her, get her to reveal herself.
And eliminate her, before she eliminates us.
You talk as though you're convinced.
I'm ready to start immediately.
To kill...
To kill before being killed.
I don't want to wear the toga of the accused or the defense.
Excuse me, but insisting on tormenting that dumb blonde in order to identify her as the woman in Elizabeth's terrible prophecy...
To kill her, I mean, it's too much.
Our friend is tender, Elizabeth, because the prophecy regards our lives, not his.
Call Torvo.
Who knows where that bitch is?
-You got us into this.
Quit hassling me, I don't feel so good, I'm going for a ride.
Keep your eyes open.
I'm want to.
Yes.
Yes, I want to.
Why didn't you answer?
I tried so many times.
I didn't want to disturb the souls of the dead.
I'm back, whores.
I was travelling in the beyond, I recorded some fantastic things.
It makes your skin crawl.
-Everything's quiet.
"Elizabeth, only you can tell me if the prophecy can really come true?"
Philip, a clairvoyant never lies.
Shall we take care of it?
-How?
Torvo may well prove useful.
But he has one small defect.
-He's expensive.
The problem is how to get all the money that he'll want to send out his killers?
I have the right idea.
-I will be completely faithful to your idea.
It can save us.
-What are you waiting for?
You'll be scared.
-If I decide to play...
I'll get where I want.
-We'll kill aunt Clarissa.
But how will her death benefit us?
-You'll inherit all her money.
And she'll be dead, the rich aunt.
-That's a brave recording!

-This is great evidence.
And after, I followed the man with the hat.
They call him Torvo, he was with the killers.
I saw him getting a woman drunk.

Besides...
There are more important things to hear than you.

Look, I won't marry you anymore.
Did you do something with Brigitte?
-I just ignored him.
Come on, you wanted me.
-What?
I'll smack you if you say that again.
What are you?
A sheep?
I could also bite you.
-Brigitte, let's stay away from him.
And then?
We should continue.

That's Torvo.
The killer in action.

I'm enjoying it, I want a lot of money.
I find it disgusting, (?

The more (?

And you and Brigitte will be with me.
We'll see about that.
I can spy on them from that window.
And I can climb up here.

I'll get you a chair if you're not comfortable.
Are you joking?
I'm having a hernia. (?

The injections have weakened her.

-What is it?
I'm going crazy.
What's wrong?
The doors are opening, take me away.

I'm crazy.

The sense of life in dead things has always excited you.
Yes.
Yes.
The (?

I want to be the one to sacrifice her.
To enjoy her spasms.
To rape her.
It's becoming an obsession.
It's something stronger than me.
I sense death all around, I'm scared to stay here.
Soon you'll tell me even orchids make you tremble with fear.
A flower, sir?
-Yes.
This one.
Thank you, it's already paid.
Take it anyway.
You do everything...
To make me feel normal again.
I'd like to convince you that every flower has a name.
And that orchids are only flowers.
He gave her an orchid.
Extraordinary.
Something's going to happen.
Wait in the car, I need to make a call.
Mr. Lawrence.
How are you?
Fine, and you?
Lawrence!

They're strange (?

-I can't explain.
They'll keep on trying to scare her...
And with good reason.
-How can they do any worse?
I'm scared, I want to disappear.
I don't blame you.
-But I insist Cathy stays.
If there's a mystery to solve, then she needs to be here.
I might also agree.
But it's up to Cathy to decide.
-No, no.

Is that really how you feel?
-I'm won't hide it.
Not even when you needed me to kill you aunt?
It was your idea, I'm spending all my money on you.
And you want to blackmail me?
If your crimes came out I'd pay for them as well.
Do you want my body?
It's yours, take it.
Come.
You're an enchanted snake.

You'll never leave.
I want you here with me, Cathy.

Hello?

I managed to get in contact with Charlotte.
Hello?
Charlotte?
I'm listening.
Come here, I found out some crazy stuff.
They have to kill, they have to torture.
You must come here.
-See if they have Cathy?
They terrorised her with an orchid.
-They want to kill her.
I need you here, I'm scared.
All alone.
We have to kill this woman.
You need to contain her, she's a danger to us.
I see her in wide spaces, towards mountains.

But why this restaurant?
-Why not?
The woman who was found dead in my car worked here.
I'm meeting some friends, this won't take long.
I looked everywhere for you.
-I only came back for you.
This place frightens me.
Yes, yes.
Flowers.
Orchids.
Okay
Lawrence.
Help me.
They're taking me away.
Yes, yes.
Yes, okay.
It's unbelievable, they kidnapped another one.
Really?
You didn't come back for Lawrence.
I called you with extrasensory telepathy, Astoroph will enjoy your sacrifice.
And the prophecy of my death will disappear with you.
Along with the curse on my blood.
I had asked Lawrence to deliver you to us...
But he didn't obey, because you bewitched him.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Lawrence, but I need your help.
These are my colleagues.
-Good morning.
Have a seat.
(?

Do you understand?
Another five women.
What I've discovered is horrible.
They need five women to sacrifice with Cathy.
Let's report them.
-No, no.
We'll try to save them, but first I want them to go to the end.
It's a big hit, I've got some names here.
Can we get a ride?
It's a good thing you were passing by...
I was (?

My feet were killing me.
(?

Wait.
-He wants to make love to you.
Go on, Lucy, we can pay for the ride.
And we won't have to say thank you.
You can have me if you don't like her.
There's no need to treat her like that.
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Who are you?
We will sacrifice five people for you, Astoroph.
Let go of me.
Quick, come on.
Come on, let's go.
In high heels?
Hurry up.
Take this, and you take this.
Go.
Well?
-In here...
We can see everything.
-Great.
You'll drink with me.
My head is spinning.
I see everything...
Everything...
And you virgin...
-My throat.
You'll be our sacrifice to Astoroph, who wants pure victims.
It burns.
My breast...
It burns.
Only I can placate your (?

Now, torture and death...
You who signifed my death in the (?

Death (?

With torture.
-And spasms.
With the whip.
-With the whip.
And with the iron in the womb.
-Watch with pleasure...
Her torture, her death.
She is ready for you, priestess.
I want to see blood and spasms on her body.
Stop.
You knew she was my woman.
I said no, when you asked me.
-I didn't expect you to betray us.
She represents our death, so she must die.
No, she won't die.
He really is one of us.
-Tie him up.
Bastard.
You brought him here with your evil spell.
(?
) the traitor in chains , priestess.
She will die a slow agonising death because it is the end of her time.
This is the police, everyone stay still.
Let's go, take them away.
There are enough handcuffs for everyone.
The inspector didn't believe us.
-Thank you.
You were right to tell us.
-Wait, wait.
At least let me help our priestess.
You're the only one of us who figured it out.
But you must admit you don't look very intelligent.
Between the inspector who wanted to send you into the criminal underworld...
And (?
) used seven orchids.
You were right, my dear.
-Come here, Lawrence.
We need to clarify your role in all of this.
You're an animal, if we don't go they'll arrest us as well.
I want to take some more photos.
-You're completely insane.
It's going to be sensational.
Lawrence!
Help me.
I'm here.
I have to get him.
You use the motorbike and we'll take use car, follow them...
He's the head honcho.
I recognise you, you're the only one who can identify me.
Then kill me.
-My hands are clean...
I've never loved violence, I'm waiting for my surgeon.
Get off.
Brigitte.
Brigitte!
He's going to kill him.
Charlotte, I don't want to look anymore.
Besides, it's better to carry on.
Helm.
I want to sacrifice another goat, they cost less than Christians...
And they taste better.
I'm going away.
No, we were born in three, understand?
Inspire us, Astoroph, Inspire us.
We want to have some more fun with you.
We'll sacrifice goats, virgins and rams.
'...and they lived happily and discontent.'
Subtitled [rarelust]
Hey, sleeping beauty.
Hey boy, rise and shine!
Leave me alone.
C'mon boy, rise and shine.
Hell, I might've known.
I don't see how you can sleep on something that hard.
I tell you worse places to sleep.
Come on, gonna make some money?
- Light hauling!
This early?
I'd a known it be second floor.
It ain't worse than that though.
210 ought to be down here.
Morning ma'am.
Loyd and Frank's Light Hauling
I'm Loyd - this is my partner Frank.
Frank, I've been reading this book called "The Secrets to Succes"
written by a man named, J. Paul Winfield.
And he's the president of a company now, a big company.
And they can't even say which one.
But what he says is that you got to get your mind right.
It's the first thing you've got to do if you want to get somewhere, is get your mind right.
My mind ain't right I guess, huh?
Says, first get your mind right, set your mind on some goals,
set yourself a program to reach those goals, and me and you could start a program.
In the first year we'd be making 15,000 dollars.
Oh, now what kind of program are we going to be on making us 15,000 dollars a year?
That's what I'd like to know huh?
Well they can't tell you what to do.
They tell you how to get your mind right.
After you done that's up to you to go out and figure out what to do.
Mm-hmm.
How much you pay for these little gems of wisdom here, huh?
Paid about $14.95, sent off for it.
It's been worth every penny of it.
$14.95!
?
Only person that's got a good program is
J. Paul Snootfield making 15 bucks a whack off of turkeys like you.
They can't tell everybody what to do!
If they told you what to do everybody's go out and do it and then it would be a flooded market!
Uh-huh.
I don't know why I waste my words on you.
You don't know nothing about big business or high finance.
Oh I don't know anything about big business because I dropped out of high school, huh?
Didn't go to college?
I tried to go to junior college, Loyd.
You don't even have to go to junior college.
It sounds real good, Loyd, but you know, how's that going to put food on the table?
You know?
Gimme something to bank on...
How much...?
You know?
Well I got me an idea.
Got me an idea about us going into the polyurethane business.
You serious?
Yeah, it's the new thing.
I've got it on good information, it's going to be the coming thing.
We can get in on the ground floor 'cause there is nobody else around here doing it.
They use it for insulation, put it up in attics.
They put down in the middle of, you know, in between walls.
And these rich hippies like it too.
They put it over their houses.
They like it because it covers up their houses.
Now this is a real good one Loyd.
You want me to get in a business
I can't even pronounce the name?
Poly-whatcha-doodle-all-day?
This is like the chinchilla business, Loyd.
How much did we lose on that one, huh?
That was our program.
It was them air conditioners.
I should be driving a Chinchilla Cadillac by now.
How about the frog farm?
How much you drop on that one?
Now that was a case of getting in the market too late.
Just about the same time we got in, the market fell out.
How about the flying squirrels, the flying squirrels, Loyd?
Well that town, this town didn't even have a mosquito fogger when we got them flying squirrels.
Sure as shit killed our squirrels.
There are a lot of you out there listening to my voice right now and you're saying I'm too old to accept Jesus
I've wasted too much of my life.
and then some of you young people out there, you're saying
Brother Bob, I've got too much to live for,
I don't want to accept Jesus now and live a goody-goody life, miss out on all the fun.
I'll accept Jesus just before I die, give me a chance to have a little living
Let me tell you, you never know, you never know if you're going to be here tomorrow
Let me tell you Jesus can come into your life at any time and give you the fun, the enjoyment and fulfillment that you want.
You don't have to wait until you're old.
Gonna make money in this polyurethane business like we gonna find gold on Boccera Mountain, you know what I mean?
There's gold on Boccera Mountain because I know them Indians put it there.
And there's gold in this business, gold money.
There's gold money in the polyurethane business.
We're gonna get rich!
We can get rich - just like all these other people!
Man come today from the finance company.
What'd he want?
He wanted his money or he wanted my washer.
I got some money for him.
The rent's due.

It's something!

Oh just pull up a little bit.
Oh this is all right.
This is as good as it's going to get.
Well I can't see very well, Frank.
Just squash down a little bit, Paulette.
These speakers never work...
Ten little Indians - we drive like a madman to get here and they got ten minutes left before the movie starts.
Mom, I'm hungry.
Well, here's the popcorn right here.
Give me a cigarette honey, would you?
You're always bumming a cigarette.
Oh T. Frank.
I bum a cigarette because your daddy don't smoke cigarettes, T. Frank.
Cause you can't afford 'em.
Hey I can afford 'em.
Don't you worry about that.
and don't you worry about cigarettes either.
I don't want to catch you with a cigarette in your mouth
You do as I say and not as I be.
Oh that is good advice, isn't it Frank?
Let's see put a little bit of this on make it feel better.
Here, there ya go...
And don't scratch them mosquito bites, you'll get 'em infected.
Here Frank.
I don't want that on me, nuh-uh, Paulette, no, uh-uh.
You'll be up all night scratching keeping me awake.
It's making me smelly now, make my beer taste weird.
Everybody get a little of this and then them mosquitos won't bother us.
All right now, what did we come to see anyway?
Robert Newman.
Mamma, I'm thirsty.
Well we've got some Kool-Aid right here for you.
I don't want no Kool-Aid.

All right.
Be careful.
You watch out.
Oh, look what I done.
You watch out now, them cars don't have their lights on.
Don't make me come looking for you.
And don't you go into that bathroom.

Must be forty of them over there.
Yeah it's a whole family.
Hey Senor!

Frank stop it, they'll come over and stick you with their knives.
They got as much right to come to movies as we do.
All right.

There goes Dave, look at him.
Oh my goodness.
She's going to get it tonight.
Hey boy!
Frank stop it, for..., what are you doing?
Getting any?
I'm going to go home I swear.
You don't even know how to act.
You act like you're drunk already.
I ain't drunk already.
You're the one that's all giddy on one beer.
You've been giggling up like a little school girl.
I know how much beer I drink!
What's that say directed by?
Vino something something.
They never leave those things up there long enough for you to read them.
I'd like to know what those people do for a living though.
Well they do that directing.
No, that ain't work though, I mean for a living.
Why it is too work.
I mean they've got to get that room so it looks like it's a real thing.
They've got to get them, them clothes for them guys to wear, that's a lot of work.
They do that on the weekends or something.
No they don't, Frank, that's a lot of work.
They've got a lot they've got to do.
Robert Newman.
Mr. Pretty-boy.
Yeah.
He is pretty.
He's bald as a cue ball, you know that?
He is not.
Yeah, he wears a toupee and everything.
Oh Frank, he does not.
He does too.
He does not wear a toupee.
He's got a big ol' mop of hair.
Well yeah, it's not his though.
He's about 5 foot 2.
and bald as a billiard ball.
You're just jealous.
You just jealous is all...
I read that.
You watch.
Nobody will touch his hair this whole movie.
They don't never touch their hair even when their hair's messed up they don't touch it because they got it fixed in it's messed up way.
...there's a reason for it.
How's it look?
Well there ain't no place to turn around down there.
There isn't?
How far is it?
150 feet.
Not bad.
Not bad?
You gonna back this all the way down there?
Yeah, I can back it down there.
I'll back it!
Alright!
Come on, first day on the job.
Whoa!

Pull up.
Okay now straight back.

Yeah, yeah, straighten it out.
Is that straightening it out?
Naw, hell, come on yeah.
God dammit, you drive.
All right, I'll show you how to do this.
Damn.
It was close.
Got-Damn!
It's like a jungle out here.
Get out of there.
Don't run over me back there, wait a minute.
Pretty close.
You're doing great, Loyd.
You're doing great.
Come on, getting close over here, getting close.
Cut it back, Cut it back, god dammit.
Wait, ahhh... god dammit.
Cut it back the other way.
You're way in the bushes over here.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Watch me over here now, watch me, watch me.
I can't see you.
Get it back in the road Loyd, you're way up here in the bushes.
I got some leaky windows got some weird windows.
Yeah, these work real well though until you get a little old summer shower like we had last week.
It just poured through on the edges here.
And there's another one down here farther.
That one up there.
Washed half of my room away.
I tried to get a hold of the guys that sprayed it for me in the first place but - gone, skipped town, who knows.
Well you never can tell about those people that don't advertise.
Yeah, well I saw your classified ad, how long you been doing this?
We're here to stay.
We're in the business to stay.
Quite a while.
- Good.
Don't touch that trigger!
Take the kink out of it.
Twist it round there...
All right.
All right.
Don't step back.
Frank, you ready?
Yeah put it on.
All right, go.
It ain't working.
What do you mean it ain't working?
I mean nothing's coming out.
We got pressure.
Got the valves open?
The valves are open.
Nothing.
Try it again.
Nothing.
Oh hell, you're gonna have to come on down.
The valve's stuck.
It may be leaking.
What's the problem?
I don't know what the problem is.
Maybe the air...
Give it a try.
Do it again.
There's something gooped up around that shaft there, man.
Yeah.
I need something to scrape it off there with.
Here.
Wasn't leaking before.
God...
Second hand crap.
Paulette!
Understand you got your bike stole.
What are you going to do about it?
Ain't going to do nothing about it.
Well maybe this'll help.
Olan, we can't accept this.
Oh you can too.
No we can't.
What do you think about that, huh...?
Keep your hands off it.
- Is it mine?
!
Want to ride it?
No!
Frank just wouldn't want us to do this.
Paulette, I'll take care of Frank.
I don't think you can...
Look out.
Okay.
T. Frank - daddy ain't gonna like this.
All right climb on there, boy.
Give me a... push me
You ready?
Here we go, hang on.
Olan, I just don't think it's going to work out right.
Yeah, I see you!
Well I figure if he didn't have that bike to ride he'd be getting in trouble and getting in your way.
Well that's nice, I, I...
Honey, I don't think your daddy's going want you to.
This is great.
You anywhere near finished, huh?
Well I'm a lot closer than I was when I started, thank you.
"Frank and Loyd's Light Hauling" my butt.
We've been out here all day long on half a day's job again.
I'm hungry.
We're supposed to pack a lunch.
You said we'd been finished by lunch though, huh?
That lady's going to shoot us when she comes back here.
Here it is.
This is the problem right here...
That's what's wrong with it?
I think so.
Can you fix it?
Yeah, I think so.
Well howdy, I didn't make it back for lunch time.
Now it's darn near quitting time.
I guess y'all are packing up ready to go, huh?
Well, ma'am we're uh,
Yes, you're... you're what?
We had a problem here.
This is real new equipment.
It's new design equpment...
Yeah, well, what's the problem?
...and this thing here...
- It's just fouled up.
Well it's this thing here.
It's this thing - it's a thermostat and we couldn't get another one today, and but we'll get it we're about to get it.
Try to fix this one...
- It won't take long.
I'll tell you what.
I'll let you get it.
I'll give you a little time to get it.
And when y'all get it and you got it right - well, you just give me a call.
I'll get someone else to take care of this and when you learn your business, call me back.
You seem like nice folks.
So you just do that all right?
And we'll forget all about today, chalk it up to experience.
Well, ma'am, we can do this job, a good job for you, if you give us another chance, ma'am.
Shit.
Pack it up, Loyd.
Let me take you out there this afternoon.
You can give me some ideas about how to decorate that place.
I may, so...
I'll count on it.
All right.
Sure am glad you came by to visit.
I get kind of lonesome around here.
Frank's just busy all the time.
Busy, hell, busy at Shorty's.
You know he sure does treat you bad, Paulette.
A woman as pretty and good natured as you, you deserve better than that.
I don't know why you put up with it.
Oh Frank don't mean no harm, Olan.
He's just got a wild streak in him.
That ain't no excuse.
Look at this place, just look at it.
The only reason it looks like a home at all is cause what you done for it.
Well, Olan, this is my home and I don't appreciate you talking about it.
You know what I mean, Paulette.
Well the lord teaches us to accept things the way they are.
All things work together for good, temper of God.
Well he sure works in strange ways.
Listen Olan, Frank's going to be coming here pretty soon for supper.
So, I think I better get it finished up right here.
Well I can't stay long, I got work to do out at the house.
Hi Frank.
Well, speak of the devil.
What the hell is going on here?
Nothing to get riled about.
Olan just come by for a visit.
What's this about a new bike?
Olan gave T-Frank a bike to replace that one that got stolen.
He's been out there riding on it up and down.
I don't want nobody buying nothing for my boy.
I was going to buy him one to replace it.
Tell your pie-eating boyfriend to get his ass out of here.
You can pick up that spray rig over at Loyd's which broke down over there.
It's not worth a shit.
Well I showed you how to run it Frank.
What's the matter?
Alcohol and polyurethane don't mix?
What the hell's that supposed to mean, Olan?
Well, Frank, everybody knows you ain't worth a shit unless you got 4 or 5 beers in your belly.
There's the door Olan, you gonna walk out?
There's nothing to get mean about, Frank.
Somebody's got to look after Paulette and T-Frank.
I don't think that boy knows he's got a daddy
Don't give me that shit, Olan.
You've been poking your nose around here for years trying to get in Paulette's pants ever since high school.
Just paying a neighborly visit, Frank.
Just because we're cousins, Olan, that don't give you no right to poke into my personal affairs here.
Well I don't have to sit here and talk no crazy man.
Thanks for the pie and coffee, Paulette.
I'll be talking to you.
Excuse me if I don't see you out.
What did you go and do that for Frank?
'What did you go and do that for Frank?
'
What the hell am I supposed to do, Paulette?
I come home see him in here eating my food sitting in my chair, acting like the king of the hill around here.
What am I supposed to say?
'How's your pie Olan?
Are you comfortable?
Here, screw my wife. '
I can't reason with you because you're so damn bull-headed.
I catch that boyfriend of yours around here again
I'm going to fill his ass with buckshot.
You've got a lot of room to be talking, Frank.
I mean you's out running around with somebody most every night.
That's different, Paulette.
This is my home.
I've had a long hard day.
I'm tired and hungry.
I'd like to get something on the table.
I'm going to shower off.
We'll talk about this later.
All right.
See my new bike?
No I haven't.
Well it's got custom breaks.
It's even got a banana seat with reflectors.
I don't know about that bike, T-Frank.
See, it's not right for you to get a bike from anybody but your own daddy.
Frank, let's just save it, all right?
This is as good a time as any to bring it up, Paulette.
Just hang on to it till after supper.
T
- Frank, I'm think that bike's going to have to go back.
No, he gave it to me!
Yeah, well I'll get you one just as good as that one, you know.
It's not right for him to give that thing to you.
Well, it's mine.
No it ain't yours, it's Olan's.
Yes it is he gave it to me.
- You're going to have to give it back.
I'll get you one just as good as that one.
There's only four like it in town and Billy's got one.
Don't carry on, don't carry on about it T. Frank.
That's it on that bicycle!
Golly, he gave it to me!
T Frank.
The bike's going back.
Now quit crying.
See what you done?
What I done?
Yeah, what you done.
There ain't no good reason why that boy can't have that bike, Frank.
The hell there isn't when it was given to him by Olan just a foot in my door is all it is.
I can't reason with you cause you ain't got
T Frank.
Can't you shut him up?
No.
I can't shut him up.
Well I will.
T. Frank...
No, no, Frank, you leave him alone.
Paulette.
You hush, hush, you're not going anywhere if you keep this up - you hush.
Hush.
That make you feel good?
Whipping up on a little boy?
If he don't mind that's what has to be done.
That's ridiculous Frank.
That's the silliest thing
I ever seen you do.
Well I'm not going to sit around here and listen to this all night long.
I'll be at Loyd's house.
God dammit.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine...
You are lost and gone forever.
Oh, my darlin' Clementine...
You want one of these?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
How you doing, boy?
I've been better.
Get that spray rig working?
No. it's still down, but it, it's going to come around.
It's all right.
What the hell's that supposed to be?
This here's my own invention.
It's gonna make us a million dollars.
Another million dollars, huh Loyd?
Hell, what are we going to do with all our money?
Get rich, I'd say on this automatic blood bait dispenser.
You know there are 41/2 million people in the United States and everyone of them has to dig down in a jar of bait every time he wants to salt that little old fishing hole?
Every one of them can have one of these - and just have in his boat and turn it on and salt down that hole.
That's a good one, Loyd.
You and Paulette have another run in?
Hell yes.
Olan gave T. Frank a brand new bicycle today.
Can you believe that crap?
After all we've been through about that.
He's not very well schooled in the social graces.
No, he sure as hell ain't.
He's been sniffing around there trying to get in her pants - for years!
Ever since high school.
Ever since I kicked his little butt and took
My own goddamn cousin.
I say the god damn thing has to go back and I'm Mr. Bad Guy.
I'm the bad ass.
Goddamn I can't take this shit much longer.
You know what I mean?
This is a dry hole we got here, Loyd.
We ought to high tail it to a greener pastures.
Well we could go to Dallas where every house is a palace.
Hell I'm serious Loyd.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I'm on the wrong side of thirty.
If I don't get something going quick, it's never going to get going.
You ain't got it so bad, boy.
Shit, I had a chance one time to do real good.
A fella I was with in Vietnam had a real good idea about a lumber company business in Waco.
We had a bank roll to choke a horse when we got out of that service.
He wanted to go fifty fifty on it, me and him.
Hell, I piddled around and piddled around and he finally found somebody else to go in with him.
Now he's makin...
I spend all my money in bars and cheap honky tonks around town.
Now he's making a million dollars a year.
He's got a chain of them all across the state.
Goes to south America every year.
I can't even go to god damn Round Rock on the weekend.
He's a goddamn millionaire.
I've got little T. Frank and Paulette to think about though.
Well it's a little bit one of these gadgets of mine, Frank.
Cut up some spare parts, stick 'em together and live with it.
All right, you want to see this work?
Is that going to work?
Real slow, here we go.
God damn, Loyd!
Uh-uh!
Stop!
Stop!
Hey, hey, hey!
You're going to put somebody's eye out with that damn thing.
That's dangerous!
What are you going to do?
Hit the fish in the head with it and and let them float to the top?
Well hell that'll do it if nothing else will.
You got you a real winner there Loyd.
Uh-huh...
Hell yeah.
I been thinking about putting up a board right here to keep people from staring in on me seeing what I'm doing.
Yeah right, they're going to steal that number from you for sure.
Jesus Christ.
Boy how long has it been since me and you went out and had a good time on the damn town?
A good time?
A good time.
I'm talking about a hell-raising time.
It's been too long.
I think it's about time.
Are you ready?
Yeah I'm ready.
Get your hat there, partner.
"I'm just a wanderer of the wasteland, Singing 'bout my cowboy days gone by... "
There you are, Olan.
Hey Frank, what you been up to all this time?
I'm here with Rhonda Lynn.
You Devil.
You're a devil.
I'm ready to dance my way to hell.
Come on Loyd, what do you say to a dance?
Hey all right, wanna dance?
Sure.
I tell you what, I got one of those IUDs, those things are marvelous.
Bonnie, take it out!
Those things'll mess up your insides.
Well you've got to use something.
Honey the only way to prevent "It" - is not to fuck.
That's a great solution.
Well, you can use rhythm.
Rhythm?
Are you Catholic?
Hell no.
Rhonda Lynn is a nice Methodist girl.
Why isn't there ever any goddamn Kleenex in any of these places?
Because that Wayne is a cheap old redneck, that's why.
Hey Rhonda Lynn, I think Frank's kind of cute, don't you?
Yeah, I do, but I really like Loyd, you know, he's been so nice.
He's been telling me about the chemical business and all that.
He's really...
I'm really impressed with him, I really am.
Well did you see that sneaky little rodeo tramp trying to horn in on Frank?
I should have slapped the tar out of her.
Here's your chance, loud mouth.
If I wanted to talk to turds,
I would have put a phone in the toilet.
Mighty fine, cause that's just where you're going.
Now stop it.
What is wrong with you?
Would you two stop it?
Get off me.
Hell boys what's happening in there?
Hey Frank come here.
Dottie, come here.
Would you help?
All right Frank, i won you fair and square.
Come on Loyd, grab that girl, let's go.
Come on gal, let's go.
Hate to think about you and T Frank here all alone.
Not safe.
People like The Choker running around.
Olan, don't go saying that to me.
It's the truth.
Sometimes at night, I'll be lying up in that bed and I'll hear a noise outside and I'll think, oh Lord, here comes somebody after me.
I used to keep the gun.
I'd tuck it up under my pillow.
After a while I go to sleep.
That ain't safe.
You need somebody around here to take care of you.
All the time.
You don't need no gun them.
Somebody, uh, like me, maybe?
Olan?
Olan?
Yes?
Wait.
Wait.
Get off of me.
What's the matter, Pumpkin?
I, I think we've got to stop this Olan.
This aint, right, Olan.
Well of course it's right if that's what you want.
That's what you want, aint it?
Only part of me wants it.
That makes it right.
No, no, Olan.
Just what do you want?
I don't know, but that ain't it.
Well, why not?
Cause it ain't right.
Well I don't understand you called me up and woke me up out of a sound sleep to have me come over here and entertain you.
I, I, I don't know what you want.
I called you because I thought you was my friend.
I am your friend.
Look at all the things I bought you.
Done give you everything I've gotten my hands on.
Well, do I have to pay for it with that?
Pay for it?
Hell, it's a little gratitude.
It's the least you can do.
Get out of my house.
Get out of your house what do you mean go on and get out of here?
Get away from my house!
What about that bicycle?
What about the curtains on that wall?
I don't want your stuff, I just want you to go away.
Go away?
Go away.
Go away.
You're going to tell that to John T. Frank when he turns out like his daddy?
He ain't going to turn out just like his daddy.
Huh?
!
He's not.
Just like his daddy.
He's not gonna turn out like...
You get out of here.
Ungrateful bitch
You get away from my house.
And you take that god damn bicycle with you.
I don't want that...
You take it.
Take it anyway.
Take it!
Let me tell you the story of a businessman who ame to my office just a couple of weeks ago and he said,
"Brother Bob, he had tears streaming down his cheeks, "
he said, Brother Bob, "I've been drinking my life away.
Says, I'm making my family miserable.
I'm drinking a pint of whiskey every day.
And I'm drinking just old beer and wine.
He says, I'm making my associates miserable.
And I've even been unfaithful to my wife, my loyal wife of 30 years,
And I've been running arounf on her and cavorting with all kinds of women. "
And he says, "Brother Bob, it's making me miserable inside and I need help.
Isn't there something you can do?
Please reach out and help me. "And I said, there's nothing I can do for you, but Jesus can come into your life and he can change your life.
Can we pray together?
Yeah, that's the big hacienda, huh?
Uh-huh.
Got a bathroom?
I sure have to go.
We have one though.
Y'all watch out for this wilderness.
Okay, there we are.
Come on.
Come on, this is it.
Damn!
What the hell is going on?
Daddy!
Don't shoot.
It's me, Rhonda Lynn.
Tell him we're not poachers and put that god damn thing down.
Let's get out of here.
I ain't getting shot over no damn bacon and eggs.
Oh no, no, no, daddy!
What was that Loyd, a twenty gauge?
Hell I don't know, but he's going to have to get on top of that house to shoot me.
Daddy, it's me!
That you?
Rhonda Lynn?
Daddy.
How are you?
I brought some friends with me.
Well you stand up now where I can see you.
Huh?
... well come on y'all, stand up.
Come on.
We're coming.
Okay, come on.
Don't be scared it will be all right.
Morning!
I'm sorry I took a shot at y'all, but, you know, you can't be too careful.
Yeah, you bet.
That's the important thing.
You never can tell when them government men gonna throw down on you.
You know?
You see there?
I feel better already.
You know I like to take the BC powder and all such as that until I get to feeling better.
Once your health goes, oh, that is the end of the hump.
Man, I used to go chase them mavericks up in Bocera Canyon all day.
All night too, if need be.
Was you raised up on Bocera?
Oh yeah, I worked up there as a boy and all my life.
So you know about that Indian gold up there?
Well of course there's gold up there.
Everyone knows that.
They've been talking about it for years.
Sterling and me used yo hunt it.
Sterling's the one that knew where it was.
Before Sterling died, he give me the map, see.
Well I'd go up there myself now and get it, if I didn't have these useless things for legs.
Yes sir, me and Sterling would have gone up there and got that if he hadn't gone and got hisself shot, you know?
I guess that gold's still up there.
Ain't nobody going to go up there and move it or anything.
Can we look at that map?
I never tried, and I ain't ever going to stop...
Sterling?
Is that you?
Well now put that down now Sterling.
Now wait a minute, I tried to do right by you but they caught up with me.
See, they drawed straws on me, Sterling, and if it be the short straw and then you got to do it or they gonna kill you.
That's the way it is.
Now put that down now.
Come on now.
Now come on over here and sit down and have a cup of coffee.
Now Rhonda Lynn, get Sterling a cup of coffee.
Sit down.
Pull your table in there.
Got to be going.
Well, this is where I get out.
Yep, I guess so.
Sure have enjoyed it.
I did too, Frank.
Hang loose now.
We'll do it again sometime.
Take care of yourself.
Bye-bye.
I'm glad you didn't bring no smelly things home with you.
Frank, ain't you even gonna kiss me?
How you doing?
I'm okay.
You want to help me?
Crank the ice cream?
Hell...
All right.
It's peaches.
Okay!
Paulette, I'd rather us just get it over now
Let's just get it out in the open now.
I ain't going to holler at you, Frank.
Ain't no point in me doing that.
You know?
I could rant and rave at you all day and I wouldn't be changing you none.
Frank, I'll tell you something.
This morning, I was real upset and I went out of the house,
I just felt like I was dead inside, and I started walking down the street.
It was like this voice was saying to me, it was saying,
Come on.
Come on over here.
So I just kept walking and finally,
Frank, I come to that big old tent down there.
You know the tent meetings they're having?
and I went in there and that preacher's preaching, Frank, and he's just preaching right to me.
He just lifted me right up out of my seat!
He said, he said, Sometimes we're like little lost sheep that have just gone astray.
Everyone's just following after their own ways and the Lord has laid on Jesus all of our sins.
Paulette, all that religious is - a bunch of crap for the people waiting for the big pie in the sky, a bunch of losers.
That's not right, Frank.
It's a way to get through this world when things ain't the way you want it to be.
You got to live and learn.
See I can't be changing you.
I just got to take care of making me the way Jesus had have me to be.
I've been doing me some thinking too.
What about?
I think Loyd's right.
I think I need a new program.
I been thinking about how I've been treating you and T Frank, haven't been a daddy to him, haven't been a husband to you either.
Paulette, I've been cheating on you.
I've been lying to you for years.
I ain't been no man to you.
You deserve better than me, Paulette.
I'm wrong.
I've been wrong for years, honey, and I'm sorry, I'm wrong.
I'm going to change.
I swear I'm going to change.
I'm so sorry.
Honey, I'm so sorry.
Jesus will take care of us.
I swear it, Paulette, I'm going to change.
I'm so sorry.
Hush.
It's going to be all right, Frank.
Jesus'll take care of us.
It'll be okay.
I'm going to change, Paulette, I swear it I am.
Things are going to be different around here.
I know it.
They are.
I know.
Here's your 5 bucks worth.
Ten gallons I'll give you a free car wash.
All right.
Could use it.
Why not?
Why not?
Make old Bill proud.
You could use it all right.
Looks like you've been jumping through mud puddles.
Let me see some of that.
You've seen it.
Split it up - 50-50.
Alright. $50, $100, $150, $200, $250.
There are no expenses this time is there?
Yeah there's been expenses, but we can take it out later.
Plenty of cash...
Aww... you made me forget how much I counted out.
Another shot here... 50, 100, 150, 2, 250, 3, 350, 4, 450, FIVE hundred dollars.
That's right, how bout that?
This looks pretty even though it does have a Yankee on the front of it.
I don't care.
I don't care what he did.
We better put this thing away.
We're out here facing the road...
Yeah, let's not that out here.
I could get a new chainsaw.
Hell yeah.
Chainsaw, you could have a chainsaw.
new boots.
Start dressing with class instead of being a slob in these rags.
You're going to waste your money again.
Loyd, I take it all back what I said about J. Paul Winfield.
You got you a good program here and you got your mind right too, buddy.
I thought you'd see the light once the cool green come along.
Put it there partner.
All right.
All right.
Let's go get drunk.
Buy us a bottle and ride around all afternoon.
Get in and let's go!
Thank y'all.
He sells it on TV.
They're going to sell it on TV like that Ronco deal.
Yeah, that's what he does.
He puts it out there right where the housewife can get it.
Well you gonna give me one or am I going to have to buy it at K-mart?
We'll give her on0, won't0we partner?
Sure, we have you out for the first one off the line.
Yeah, you get number one, honey.
You get the number one off the line.
You bet.
Must have been that phone call I made, Frank.
What phone call?
Well I wasn't going to tell you about it, but I called Brother Bob in Oklahoma City...
That preacher on the radio?
Yeah, and I told him things weren't going very good for us and could sure use some mercy.
Well he said, you just keep praying and I'll be praying.
Look what Jesus done.
I don't know if Jesus did it or J. Paul Winfield.
Loyd did all the work.
He's the one...
Yeah I did it.
- Well Jesus did his share.
Well we need all the help we can get though, don't we partner?
Huh?
Sure, sure.
We just gonna have to celebrate.
Yeah, let's do something.
I got a piece of round steak in the refridgerator.
I'll just fry it up for us.
What do you say?
Daddy?
You want some chicken fried steak?
- Yeah...
Can I play with my glove?
Sure there you go buddy.
Chicken fried.
With gravy and mashed potatoes?
Yeah, you ready for that?
- Come on in the house, partner.
I'm so tired of my own cooking.
Hey buddy, I'll help you oil that up, we'll break that glove in right.
Come on in the house, partner...
So the hot air'll go off the porch instead of right up on the roof up there cause it'll get hot.
We don't need it now,
Yeah, that'll be good.
Then what I'd like to do is clear off all this crap off the front porch here.
Yeah, we got lots of bottles.
Cash in the bottles.
And I was thinking about putting a 4x4 across here and putting that swing that Loyd has over at his house.
You think it will hold it?
Yeah it will hold it if I support it real good.
Oh, I'd like that.
That'd be good.
Yeah, that'd be good.
Come around back I want to show you some stuff too.
We'll clear all this out, haul that old thing out and mow it back over here.
I'll give them toys to my sister.
Her little kids can use them.
Yeah, they're at that age, I guess.
T. Frank'll have to get all this stuff around here.
Yeah, if I can get him away from the television set.
You will when you start making money.
I want to get back on this, get T Frank to help me.
I can get all my tools out and store a bunch of this stuff.
See my tools are just lying around out in the rain like this.
It's ruining them.
T Frank drags them out, that's why they're rusty.
Yeah, well it's just ruining things.
Do you think we could fix them steps, Frank?
Yeah, that's what I was fixin' to say.
It's all rotted out.
- Someone's gonna fall on 'em one of these days...
See?
I got to take the whole thing down... but it won't take long to fix that, that's for sure.
Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.
Don't forget to get to get the coffee sweetner.
I won't.
Don't let anybody stick you up.
I won't.
Remember my sister and her husband are coming for supper?
Yeah, I remember it.
You better hurry you gonna miss that bus.
I'm trying to hurry.
If you'd shut up for a second.
Hey good-lookin!
Alex!
It's me, Frank!
God, I didn't recognize you.
This is quite a surprise, how you doing?
I'm doing okay.
How you like my new car?
Oh, it's gorgeous!
How about hopping' in and let's go get a drink or something somewhere?
Go for a little ride.
Okay.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Come on...
That sounds alright.
Let's get a table over there by the bar.
I like to watch the bartender pour our drinks.
Frank, could we sit over...
how about over here?
Sure.
It's all the same to me.
It's secluded over here.
Another thing is I wanted to set you straight on
Frank Rogers, you know?
I'm not just an ol' cedar scrubber out there handyman.
Me and Loyd are what you night call independent oil men.
We do a lot of oil work.
Yeah.
That's what we're into now.
We do real well usually, you know, uh, but just lately we've had some hard times.
We got a place up in Dallas me and Loyd go to every now and then.
We got an office up there.
Really?
Yeah, we spend a lot of time, just go up there for business.
Dallas, I could do without the place.
We got us a box out at the Texas Stadium, you know, for the Cowboy games.
We go out there...
It's a company box, you know, but...
Hey, uh, speaking of nice places, we got a, I'm building a little house out here in West Lake Hills.
It's in the construction stage now.
Uh...
Yeah, look I left my wallet in my glove box I guess, if I left it.
I might have left the house without...
Can you get these and I'll pay you back when we get out?
I'll write you a check.
I got my checkbook out there.
Oh yeah, sure, sure, I'd be glad to.
We'll settle up out in the car.
Uh, as...
You know...
Yeah, keep the change.
Thank you.
I need to be getting back.
Well I don't see the big hurry.
I haven't even shown you the inside the other end there where the bedrooms are.
Frank I need to leave, I really do.
I need to go.
Well what's the big hurry?
Well, uh...
I just...
I know a lot of people in this neighborhood.
Yeah?
And, uh, it's just better for me not to be seen out here.
Well I don't see anything wrong with taking a drive out in the nice afternoon.
There is something wrong.
There is.
Come on, I want to go back.
All right.
You're the boss.
Thank you.
Well, take care of yourself...
- Alrighty.
...and bye-bye, Frank.
Have fun at your tennis lesson.
Frank, I was busy with that middle linebacker making the hole you was supposed to go through.
Yeah, well, it got kind of clogged up in there so I took an alternate route with nobody helping me out there.
Didn't even see that son of a bitch.
I saw you drop the ball, Frank.
Yeah, well, so did everybody else.
That's not all that got dropped that night though if I remember correctly.
Wasn't you supposed to meet Paulette out in ont of the Get it N' Go and go to the drive in with her?
She didn't show up, did she?
Hell, I can tell you where she was.
Yeah, we were thinking about old Olan, sitting by hisself when we were steaming up the windows at the drive-in.
Frank...
Look like you come into some money there, Frank.
Yeah, I'm doing a little bit better.
Or did you just borrow that suit?
No, paid money for it.
Good money for it too.
What is it this time?
Chinchillas or frogs?
Ain't neither one, Olan.
Ain't wrecking cars either.
You look awful scruffy over there, Olan.
You been out tracking bears through the woods for the last couple of weeks?
No wonder you ain't got no women around you.
Smell like a bear.
Must got awful lonesome out there with that big new house and nobody to keep you company.
Oh I don't know Frank, I got 'em calling me.
Hell I can imagine what's calling you up, some ol' dirty lay from an old bar somewhere.
Sure wouldn't talk about my wife that way.
Now what the hell is that supposed to mean, Olan?
You tell me, Frank.
I only say what I mean.
I been meaning to give you something for years, Olan.
Something you been asking for.
Take it easy now fellas, don't start nothing...
What's that old buddy, old cousin?
Just this.
You son of a bitch.
Why she's the one that makes my fingers stink, Frank.
Oh come on...
Knock it off.
Frank!
Come on, Olan, knock it off!
You get up again, you son of a bitch, you'll get more of the same.
Come on.
Get on top of him.
Yeah, come on!
Frank, you got him now.
You son of a bitch I'm want to kill you.
God damn it I hate your ass.
I hate your ass.
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
I hate your ass.
I hate you and I wanted to kill you for a long time.
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch.
I'm going to kill your ass.
Son of a bitch I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
Goddamn it.
God damn you.
Goddamn you!
I've hated you a long time you son of a bitch.
Olan.
Olan, are you all right?
Hey.
Olan, god dammit, why'd you do this?
Olan, you all right?
Hey.
Olan, I'm sorry.
Come on.
You all right?
Come on buddy.
You all right?
You all right, Olan?
Frank, I never touched her.
Hey it's all right buddy.
Come on, cousin, let's get some beer.
- Set 'em up there, Shorty.
Here you go boys
- Olan, Frank.
Olan, it's wrong for us to fight - hate each other for so many years.
Let's startover, huh?
- Looked like he was out for the count.
- You okay, Olan?
You bring that polyurethane machine by
I'll give you your money back.
Oh cousin, don't worry about that.
Man, he hit me just right in there, man.
I think I like you better when you're poor.
Here's to you cousin.
Here's to tomorrow.
All right let's start over.
Every time Dallas screws up they pan to the cheerleaders.
Yeah I could do without that.
They do have big tits.
Oh, you noticed, huh?
Yeah.
I noticed.
Hey y'all.
How you doing, Jimbo?
How's it going buddy?
Pretty good and you?
Pretty good.
Who's winning?
We ain't.
We ain't?
No.
What's the score?
21- 14
Howd.
What did you do to your face?
It's not what I did, it's what Olan did.
You and Olan been fighting?
Yeah, we had it out.
What about, Frank?
It's about 15 years, 30 years of hating each other you know?
It's, we ironed it all out though, you know, we buried the hatchet.
Did you hurt him?
No, he's all right.
Well hurt him worse than he hurt me I think, but it's, you know...
Want some ice on your face?
- I'm all right, I'm all right...
But you know, it's all over with now.
Go?
In the middle of the Dallas game?
!
Are you kidding?
Come on, Jim.
Let's go.
We talked about it for the longest time and,
You know, buried the hatchet and that's that.
Where'd you get that new suit?
Huh?
I said where'd you get that suit from?
You like it?
Yeah it's nice.
I bought it this afternoon.
I thought it looked good on me.
Huh?
Doesn't it?
I needed a suit.
Our money?
Well yeah, I needed a suit, Paulette, didn't I?
Yeah you did.
You got dirt all over the legs.
I know it's brand new too.
Did you spend all of our money?
Every last nickel of it.
You did?
Oh there'll be a hell of a lot more money coming in, Paulette, you know.
Not for sure, I sure don't.
Well it's gonna be all right, isn't it?
Hell it'll be all right.
Don't worry about it.
What the hell's that?
Is that that old... that new dress?
That's that skirt that Jeanie and I bought, that they said it's too long so I'm hemming it up so you can see a little more of my leg.
A little more leg, yeah.
We're gonna look real snazzy, aren't we?
We will.
Look I'm gonna, is y'all already have eaten?
Yeah, we ate every bit of it but you didn't come.
I'm hungry.
Is there anything?
- Well, I'll fix you something.
I'll fix you a sandwich.
Yeah that's fine.
I'm gonna go watch the game with old Jimbo in there.
You wanna watch it with us?
No, I don't care nothing about football.
Well hell, come on in here.
No, I don't like it.
Bacon all right?
Fine.
He get a hand on that or what?
Yeah, I think somebody did.
He might've just shanked it.
We'll see it on the replay.
That's the break we needed though.
All right boys, let's get the rain game going here.
Get to cooking.
Plenty of time left, plenty of time.
We got this game, I think.
- March it on down.
Right on down there.
There's my man, go, Newhouse, Newhouse.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Punch it in there!
That's the one-two punch.
Dorset and Newhouse.
Dorset and Newhouse.
Can't go wrong with Dorset kid, you can't go wrong.
Oh God.
Throw it, throw it, throw it!
Yeah there we go!
I can't believe it!
Yeah!
There we go.
Now we're talking.
That should put you in the clear there buddy, shouldn't it, huh, Jimbo?
After I pay my hospital bill maybe I don't know.
Why do they always do that, wait to the last minute?
God, it scares the shit out of me every time.
They haven't won yet.
I know he's gonna fumble it the way he's carrying it.
- Like it was a loaf of bread or something.
You like him, huh?
Yeah, you know I do.
Extra point make seven points, all right, all right.
Just Hold 'em.
Hold 'em.
You want a date with him?
I know a guy woks up there with the Cowboys...
You want a date with Bill, with your boy?
...and I'll get you a date with one of those cheerleaders, OK?
Now you're talking!
Look at this, look at this, hey y'all this is my commercial.
This is our thing here!
This is our mop!
Look at this!
This is our new mop!
It's on television already!
What do you mean?
That's our mop that Loyd invented right there!
Look at that!
Loyd?
You and Loyd did that thing?
Yeah.
Wizard Mop...
I can't believe that.
Paulette, that thing's on TV!
I can't believe that.
I hope Loyd's watching.
You boys work fast.
Boy they sure do.
He said he was going to have it on TV before Christmas...
But my god it's only been like well 3-4 weeks, a month or so.
How much you getting on this deal?
Well we got a percentage off the gross, or I don't know.
Loyd knows all that figuring stuff.
We got a thousand dollars off of it.
Up front?
Yeah.
You got a contract?
Yeah, we signed a contract.
He hasn't sent us our copy yet though.
But you know, I can't believe it's on television already.
When did you sign that contract, Frank?
About a month ago, about two weeks ago.
At his office...
He hasn't sent you the contract yet?
No, no, we were talking about that too.
We were going to go see him or something.
Frank and Loyd
- Had to go for the Coast on business.
Be back next year.
Thanks for the mop.
Keep your chin up.
R.L. Meyers
I could change that where it could adjust and it would go up and down and you could adjust it down to the floor or pull it up away from the floor.
You like that?
Well we ought to get together and talk about those.
All right.
Going out of town?
All right, how about next week then?
Oh yeah, there's one other thing, right next week, we don't have any paper work yet?
We didn't get anything in the mail, uh-uh.
What can I help you boys with?
We're here to see how production's going on our mop.
That's out of my Department.
Y'all let me call somebody.
Think you better get Meyers down here...
Gentlemen, I am Lance Morgan.
I don't understand what this means.
Speak English.
Tell me something I can understand.
This Kitchen Wizard Mop.
My records indicate that on that date Mr. Meyers has paid in full.
In fact, Mr. Johnson, I'll put it to you in simple English, and to Mr. Rogers also.
If you'll look at the last copy here...
The last paragraph...
You will note that it says, quote:
Seller hereby agrees to forfeit all claims to legal tender or purchase upon full payment... and signature notarized by the proper official and so on and so forth...
End of quote, Mr. Johnson.
This don't mean Jack Shit to me!
Where I come from someday do that deserves a goddamn good licking!
You ever come back, I'm gonna slap your scrawny ass clear to next week!
You hear me?
Get the hell out of here.
Sons of bitches...
Loyd?
Hey there partner.
It's starting to get cool out there...
I was just about to go down to Shorty's and get a beer.
You want to go with me?
Hell no...
What the hell you got there?
What are you drinking?
Some fair to middlin' Tennessee Whiskey.
Oh, yeah...
Want some?
Midland, hell.
That's more like Odessa.
Guess who I saw this afternoon.
Who?
Rhonda Lynn.
She was asking about you.
She likes you I think Loyd.
She's kinda cute.
I been doing some thinking myself and they're holding all the cards.
They got the lawyers and they got the big gorillas behind them and there's nothing we can do about it except learn from it and make better next time.
Next time.
That's just it.
I can't do it again.
Just a fluke.
The one time I could do it.
Play by their rules and all these other ideas I got out of a magazine.
That was something that was mine.
Those bastards stole it from me.
Hell.
Ever since I grew up in a damn river bottoms
I been thinking I was gonna be somebody else.
I just couldn't wait to get out of there and come to the big city and get rich and be somebody.
All I got to show for it is a bunch of half-baked projects and...
You know what, I'm just a ignorant country boy.
And all the scheming ain't gonna do nothing about that.
That's why I'm just going to pack the dog and go somewhere and do somebody else's job.
Do something I can do.
Just get money.
Like where?
Like Alaska.
That's supposed to be the new frontier up there.
Pay double time on that pipeline.
And those little boom towns are full of whores.
Get you a little Eskimo girl up there, Loyd.
That's just what I need:
one that don't talk.
What you say me and you gou out today and find us some real money, a lot of it?
How does that sound to you?
I ain't interested.
Look at this, look at this.
You know what that is?
Look at it.
I don't know what it is.
God damn treasure map is what it is.
That old man's treasure map.
Rhonda Lynn got it for me.
Look at it.
Things a 100 years old.
Look there - 'X' marks the spot.
I got me a dowsing rod out there.
It's gonna tell us how to find it once we get close and this article tells us how to operate that thing.
Look at that.
Dowsing rod...?
- Yeah.
What do you think?
Wanna go with me?
Thing just crumbles in your hands.
This is old.
You don't have to do nothing just come along with me.
Is this Sterling's map?
You're goddamn right it is.
That old man gave it to me.
Course you might have to help me bring the gold back down once we find it.
You wouldn't mind doing that would you?
Sure.
Come on.
Get your hat and your bottle there.
You don't have to do nothing, just come along with me.
What do you say partner?
Shoot, why not?
I could use some of that fresh air and sunshine.
It would be good to get out of this town for a while.
You with me?
Come on.
Let's go get rich.
Grab your hat.
Get you a blanket or something too.
All right.
It was nice of them to put this bridge here, isn't it?
That old Sterling didn't have one to come across on.
This must be the Blanco, I guess.
Yeah, hell, he had a burro.
Missed it...
Aw, turtle soup!
You could've got a turtle.
Be careful with that damn thing when you're behind me.
All right...
Jesus Christ!
I ain't never seen so much goddamn cedar in all my life.
Hey, you know where you going?
I'm trying to stick to this side of the river and go east.
That's east up there isn't it?
I don't know.
Where's that compass?
If the sun was out it would make it a hell of a lot easier.
No, that's west.
That's east.
That's east.
Let's go that way.
Shh-shh.
Wait...
Damn.
What was that?
Basset dove.
I don't know about this creek bit, Loyd.
It's turning back the other direction.
I don't think it's going to take us where we want to go.
We ought to start heading up.
Yeah, let's get up where we can see something at least and get out of these damn trees.
Shit.
it's so goddamn thick.
You got that water?
Yeah, it's in the back on the right.
Dang...
Hey wait, I didn't bring that up here for you to drink.
Partner you should have brought that bottle.
You should have brought that bottle.
I don't really know where we are, Loyd.
Or which way to go from here.
Take a break.
Huh?
Sure, stick this in there.
We're just like a couple of boy scouts out here.
Let's see.
I'm tired.
This thing is making less and less sense to me.
Feel that?
I did.
Huh?
- Yes.
Well...
Huh?
What did I tell you?
Could be...
- All right!
Could be it.
Look...
That's it!
Yeah.
All right.
All right!
We finally made it.
We're coming to get you, gold!
Well, let's get down to business.
Yeah...
We're on the right ridge.
Zooming in on it.
Look at this.
Huh.
What is that?
Dowsing rod.
I told you I had one.
Looking for gold, got to have gold bait.
Is it gold?
Yeah, Mexican gold.
Cost about 5 dollars.
Well, that's what we're looking for.
Mexican gold, I hope we find more thant 5 dollars worth of it.
...of course you son of a bitch...
Huh!
?
That gonna do it?
Huh...!
Look at that.
Grab that stuff, Loyd, come on.
That thing does it!
Uh-huh, you got to believe in it though.
But mostly you got to to believe in it.
It'll go around in circles when we get over it.
Found the scent.
I believe it did...
- Huh?
Getting warm.
See what I mean, it goes around in circles.
I'm not doing that.
Well, hell...
Huh?
So what's that mean?
That means we're sitting right on top of it.
Damn, I think there's something down here.
You think it's made out of gold?
Shit.
Shit.
Jesus.
Well, that's some damn Dowsing rod.
Well, give it time.
Shit!
I don't think that's it.
Throw that thing out.
Why don't you give it up, Frank?
Piece of shit just points out into thin air.
Shit.
Hell I can't believe this.
The gold's got to be someplace, Loyd.
Somebody didn't just come up here and move it.
You just grasping at straws, Frank.
You gotta give it up.
Grasping at straws, huh?
How many times have I grasped at your god damn straws, huh?
Hell.
Give me that.
You've been shooting that son of a bitch all day long.
I'm gonna kill something.
Shit.
Grasping at straws.
Yeah.
You got a lot of nerve to say that.
Grasping at straws, I said.
What the hell - you had to forgot that damn bottle!
I didn't forget it.
You forgot it.
I didn't forget it.
Worthless son of a bitch.
Hit anything?
Hey Frank!
Frank!
Hey, Frank?
Hey Frank?
Slip down?
Gimme that thing.
Gimme this thing!
You slip down?
I couldn't do it.
Chickened out.
What the hell you want to go and do a fool thing like that for?
Everything's gone to shit.
Seemed like the thing to do.
I couldn't do it.
Thinking about that boy of mine.
Well you got a good boy.
It's a good thing you didn't.
Hell...
Hell, it's a good thing they took that money from us.
Shit, we're lucky.
Hell, if we'd had that money I'd have moved up off somewhere in the suburbs
living with electric dishwashers,
I'd have been bored.
You wouldn't have been able to go drniking in all of your favorite places.
You like to go drinking at a discotheque?
Damn, boy.
This is - we've been working together a long time.
We've got strong backs and good arms and legs.
I know it.
We don't have to tell anybody about this okay?
No, we don't have to tell anybody.
I'll just tell them you slipped.
Oh Jesus.
We're still partners.
Are we?
Yeah.
All right.
Matter of fact, I was laying around there on the other side of this mountain.
thinking about an idea.
I think what we gotta do is come up with a better idea
to fuel automobiles.
Take water, separate it into hydrogen and oxygen and pull hydrogen off and burn it
and discharge oxygen right out the tail pipe.
You like that?
Sounds good.
Well, what do you say we get off this damn mountain?
Hell, we've had a lot of fun.
We done looked for this Mexican gold...
What do you say, boy?
Partners?
Partners.
Let's go to Shorty's and get us some beers.

DEAR, PLAYING THAT CAN ONLY BRING YOU PAIN.
IT DOESN'T, AUNT CONSTANCE.
IT GIVES ME COMFORT.
OH.
THEN I'M SURE IT WOULD PLEASE YOUR FATHER...
IF HE ONLY KNEW.
SOMEHOW, I THINK HE DOES.
OH, VERY NICE.
ISN'T IT FORTUNATE...
WE FOUND OUT THAT BLUE IS ALFRED'S FAVORITE COLOR ?
AH, YES.
YOU MIGHT SHOW MORE ENTHUSIASM.
IT ISN'T EVERY GIRL WHO HAS THE CHANCE...
TO BE THE BRIDE OF ALFRED BROWNING.
DON'T WORRY, AUNT CONSTANCE,
I'LL BE GOOD.
I PROMISE.
OF COURSE.
THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.
COME.
THEY'RE WAITING FOR US.
OH, COME HERE.
YOU'RE JUST BEAUTIFUL, ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

I FORGOT MY HANDKERCHIEF.
IT'S 2 O'CLOCK.
YOU KNOW HOW YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW-TO-BE IS.
SHE EXPECTS US TO APPEAR PROMPTLY AT 2:00.
GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
I PROMISE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ?
IT'S YOUR DAY OFF.
I JUST HAD TO TELL YOU.
THE LAKE IN CENTRAL PARK IS FROZEN OVER !
I WISH I COULD GO WITH YOU.
HAVE A HEADACHE !
A HEADACHE ?
I CAN'T.
ALFRED AND MISS BROWNING...
ARE GOING TO POP THE QUESTION TODAY.
HOW ROMANTIC.
BETH ?
WE'RE WAITING, DEAR.
I'VE GOT TO GO.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
IT'S A SHAME I CAN'T BE WISHING YOU THE SAME.
HERE SHE IS.
EITHER I'M FAST, OR IT'S 3 MINUTES PAST 2:00.
I FORGOT MY HANDKERCHIEF.
I'M SORRY.
DEAR, DO COME SIT DOWN BY ME.
BETH, COME AND SEE.
THERE'S A PAINTED BUNTING.
THEY DON'T STRAY FROM THE SEA, BUT WITH THIS COLD SNAP --
ALFRED, COME AWAY FROM THAT WINDOW.
YOU'RE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE INFLUENZA.
WELL,
NOW WE'RE ALL HERE.
ALFRED HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU, BETH.
I -- WELL ?
I --
THAT IS,
IT WOULD DO ME GREAT HONOR --
GO ON, ALFRED.
YOU'RE DOING BEAUTIFULLY.
THANK YOU, MISS CONSTANCE.
WHAT I MEAN TO SAY, BETH,
IS THAT YOUR UNCLE WILLIAM,
AND MY SISTER, AGNES,
HAVE DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS...
FOR US TO MARRY.
BETH, WHAT DO YOU SAY ?
I DIDN'T HEAR A QUESTION.
SHE'S QUITE RIGHT, WILLIAM.
ONE COULD SAY THAT ALFRED...
HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT,
PERHAPS A PLAN FOR A MERGER.
I HAD NO DIFFICULTY DISCERNING THE MEANING OF ALFRED'S REMARKS.
NOR I.
ALFRED, DEAR, GO BACK AND START AGAIN,
JUST THE WAY YOU DID BEFORE.
IT WOULD GIVE ME GREAT HONOR -- FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.
HE'S ASKING YOU TO MARRY HIM.
THAT'S IT.
I'M ASKING YOU...
TO MARRY ME.
IS SOMETHING WRONG, DEAR ?
NO.
PERHAPS YOU WOULD FAVOR ALFRED WITH AN ANSWER ?
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR OFFER, ALFRED.
I SHALL BE PLEASED TO ACCEPT IT.
YOU MEAN, WE'RE ENGAGED ?
UNOFFICIALLY.
THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE...
AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND PLACE.
YOU HAVE MADE A WISE CHOICE, MY DEAR.
I'M VERY PLEASED.
MY DARLING, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
NOW, ALFRED, ISN'T IT YOUR TURN ?
OR SHOULD I SAY, "NEPHEW" ?
DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE ?
MINE, TOO.
I THOUGHT SO.
I COULD SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.
YOU SHOULD GO HOME AND LIE DOWN.
YOU'RE DELICATE.
PERHAPS THAT IS FOR THE BEST.
BETH SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE PALE, HERSELF.
PERHAPS THEY'RE BOTH SUFFERING FROM EXCITEMENT ?
I AM.
EXCUSE US, WILLIAM.
ON THE WHOLE, I WOULD SAY THIS HAS BEEN...
A VERY SUCCESSFUL DAY, WOULDN'T YOU ?
QUITE.

YOU'D BE ON THE ICE SHOWING OFF LIKE YOUR FRIEND.
MARY ?
I GOT AWAY.
SKATE WITH ME.
AND HAVE THEM...
FIND OUT I KNOW HOW ?
NOT ON YOUR LIFE.
COME ON.
IT'S MORE FUN SKATING...
THAN TALKING TO SHOW-OFFS LIKE THAT.
NOW DO YOU THINK I CAN TEACH YOU ?
 MARY, LET'S GO.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE US ?
ME MANNERS !
MY MOTHER WOULD BE THAT ASHAMED !
MEET FRANZ HOLNER, AND RUDY --
MILLER.
THIS IS MY FRIEND, BETH ATHERTON.
ARE YOU ALSO AN UPSTAIRS MAID ?
I'M THE -- BETH'S THE PARLOR MAID.
WITH YOUR BEAUTY, YOU SHOULD BE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE.
THANK YOU.
I'D REALLY LIKE TO SKATE.
THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT YOU SHALL DO.
FRANZ WILL TAKE MARY.
I WILL HELP YOU.
IN NO TIME, YOU WILL BE GLIDING OVER THE ICE...
AS THOUGH IT WERE YOUR SECOND HOME.
THAT'S KIND OF YOU, BUT --
SOUNDS LIKE JUST THE TICKET.
FIRST, WE PUT OUR RIGHT FOOT FORWARD,
AND GLIDE.
VERY GOOD.
SOON YOU'LL FEEL MORE SECURE.
DO YOU THINK I MIGHT TRY IT ALONE ?
ONE MUST HAVE PATIENCE.
I DOUBT --
WAIT !
BETH ?
YOU'LL INJURE YOURSELF.
AAAH !
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
[ Gasp ] MY HAIR !
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY HAIR !
IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL.
I DID IT NO HARM.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT ?
PLEASE,
ALLOW ME.
GO AWAY.
GO AWAY !
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOU.
GO AWAY.
GO AWAY.
I CANNOT --
GO AWAY !
AS YOU WISH.
YOU'VE BEEN A NAUGHTY GIRL, Fraulein.
YOU COULD SKATE ALL ALONG.
Danke schon.
I'VE NEVER MET SUCH A VAIN GIRL.
AS THOUGH HER HAIR FALLING DOWN...
WAS THE WORLD'S GREATEST CALAMITY.
IF YOU SEE MARY AGAIN, YOU MIGHT...
GIVE HER THIS TO GIVE TO HER.
Jawohl, mein Herr.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT TO HER YOURSELF ?
YOU THINK I'M BEING A BIT OF A FOOL ?
AREN'T YOU ?
WE MEET PRETTY GIRLS WE'D LIKE TO SEE AGAIN,
AND YOU'RE BEHAVING LIKE A PRUSSIAN ARISTOCRAT.
SLOW DOWN !
YOU'D THINK YOU WERE BEING PURSUED...
BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF !
I WANT TO GET HOME.
YOU'RE MAKING TOO MUCH OUT OF THIS.
YOU LET HIM THINK YOU COULDN'T SKATE.
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.
AND WORKING FINE...
UNTIL YOU COULDN'T RESIST SHOWING OFF !
YOU FORGOT ONE.
YOU SEE ?
SHE IS A CONCEITED, RUDE,
IMPOSSIBLE, CHURLISH GIRL !
BUT ADORABLE.
I SEE NOTHING ADORABLE IN BAD MANNERS !
THIS ONE HAS BAD MANNERS.
THE ONE LAST WEEK HAS TOO MANY FRECKLES.
SALLY'S FRIEND TALKED TOO MUCH !
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE !
I THINK YOU DON'T WANT TO BE PLEASED.
PERHAPS YOU CAN FORGET I'M BETROTHED TO HILDA.
I CANNOT.
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT ?
I HAVE AN ARRANGED BRIDE WAITING FOR ME, TOO.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T LOOK AT A PRETTY GIRL.
WHILE I'M IN THE U.S.,
I WORK HARD, SEND MONEY HOME.
WHEN I HAVE FREE TIME, I FLIRT A LITTLE.
WHAT HARM CAN THERE BE IN THAT ?
FRANZ,
IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ONE OF THESE...
OH-SO-PRETTY AMERICAN GIRLS,
YOU WILL FIND OUT.
FALL IN LOVE ?
I'M NOT PLANNING TO FALL IN LOVE.
OH.
I DID NOT KNOW ONE FELL IN LOVE...
ONLY IF ONE PLANNED TO.
NOW, DEAR, ALL YOUR GUESTS ARE SEATED,
AND YOU WISH THE SERVANTS TO BRING IN THE FIRST COURSE.
RING THE BELL.
SIT UP STRAIGHT, BETH.
A LADY NEVER PERMITS HER BACK...
TO TOUCH THE BACK OF THE CHAIR.
WHERE'S MARGARET ?
SHE HAS THE GRIPPE, MA'AM.
I'M HELPING IN THE KITCHEN.
THEN YOU CAN PUT THE BOWL IN FRONT OF MISS BETH.
BEGGIN' YOUR PARDON, MA'AM,
HOW MANY ARE WE SERVING TODAY ?
24.
THEN I BETTER GET A BIGGER BOWL.
MARY, IT'S ALL MAKE-BELIEVE.
MARY'S QUITE RIGHT.
IT'S IMPERATIVE...
YOU LEARN THE CORRECT DISHES FOR EACH OCCASION.
I LEARNED ALL THAT FROM MY MOTHER.
YES, OF COURSE.
AFTER ALL, YOUR MOTHER WAS A SCHUYLER.
IN HER REDUCED CIRCUMSTANCES, SHALL WE SAY,
SHE DIDN'T HAVE OCCASION TO ENTERTAIN...
ON THE GRAND SCALE WHICH YOU'LL BE EXPECTED...
AS THE BRIDE OF ALFRED BROWNING.
MRS. ADAM'S DRIVER IS AT THE DOOR, MADAM.
OH, DEAR.
WHERE HAS THE MORNING GONE ?
EXCUSE ME.
WE'LL HAVE TO FINISH LATER.
IT'S MY AFTERNOON AT THE SETTLEMENT HOUSE.
THEN WE'LL FINISH TOMORROW.
MADAM, TOMORROW YOU'RE POURING AT THE ORPHANS' TEA.
OH, GOODNESS.
THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO !
I CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO DO IT ALL !
[ Sigh ]
WILL THAT BE ALL, MRS. ALFRED BROWNING ?
MARY, I CAN'T.
I CAN'T SPEND MY LIFE GIVING DINNER PARTIES...
FOR ALFRED'S ORNITHOLOGICAL FRIENDS,
AND TRYING TO PLEASE MISS BROWNING.
IT WON'T BE SO BAD.
MAYBE AFTER HE HAS A WIFE,
HE WON'T BE FRIGHTENED OF HIS SISTER.
HE MIGHT EVEN PERK UP A BIT.
REALLY ?
NO.
OH.
A POX ON YOUR IRISH HONESTY.
WOULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED ME IF I HAD LIED ?
NO.
WOULD YOU HAVE A MINUTE TO LOOK AT MY DRESS ?
IT'S FINISHED ?
MY MOTHER'S IN THE KITCHEN WITH IT.
SHE SAID TO GET YOUR APPROVAL.
AS IF SHE NEEDS MY OPINION !
SHE KNOWS MORE ABOUT CLOTHES...
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAN I EVER WILL.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'LL BE THE BELLE OF THE BUTLER'S BALL.
MRS. O'HALLORAN, YOU'RE A GENIUS.
NO WONDER THEY CALL YOU...
THE BEST SEAMSTRESS ON DELANCY STREET.
I WAS HOPING YOU'D LIKE IT.
I LOVE IT.
MR. GRIGGS, IS IT TO YOUR TASTE ?
AS A MAN, I MEAN.
I CAN GIVE IT MY UNQUALIFIED APPROVAL.
AND LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, MRS. MOONEY ?
GO ON WITH YOU !
YOU KNOW I'M GREEN WITH ENVY.
YOU'RE ALMOST AS GOOD A SEAMSTRESS AS I AM A COOK.
WHICH REMINDS ME.
WOULD YOU COME UPSTAIRS AND LOOK AT MY BALL GOWN ?
IT SEEMS TO HAVE SHRUNK SINCE LAST YEAR.
PERHAPS IT'S YOUR avoirdupois, MRS. MOONEY.
DON'T GO STARTING YOUR HIGHFALUTIN ENGLISH TALK.
FINISH YOUR PRIMPING, MARY.
IT'S TIME TO SET THE TABLE.
OH, MARY !
DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO AMERICAN ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT ?
FRANZ HOLNER'S GOING TO BE MY ESCORT.
OH, MARY, HOW COULD YOU ASK HIM ?
YOU BARELY KNOW HIM.
AND HE BARELY KNOWS ME, SO WE'RE EVEN.
IS HIS CONCEITED FRIEND COMING ALONG ?
WHICH FRIEND ?
YOU KNOW.
THAT...
RICHARD, ROBERT, OR RUDY WHAT'S-HIS-NAME ?
OH, YOU MEAN RUDY MILLER ?
NO.
FRANZ SAYS HE'S GOT OTHER FISH TO FRY THAT NIGHT.
I DO WISH YOU WERE COMING, THOUGH.
THERE'S GOING TO BE DANCING TO A REAL, LIVE ORCHESTRA,
SINGING, AND A PRIZE GOING TO THE PRETTIEST GIRL.
WHICH I'M SURE YOU'LL WIN.
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,
IT'S LUCKY I AM, THAT YOU WON'T BE THERE TO GRAB IT.
YOU SHOULD BE GOING OUT...
AND DANCING YOUR HEART OUT,
NOT PRACTICING TO BE OLD BEFORE YOUR TIME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE ARE THINKING,
ARRANGING A MATCH LIKE THAT.
THEY'RE THINKING OF MY FUTURE.
THEY DON'T WANT ME TO RUN OFF...
WITH A PENNILESS MUSIC TEACHER LIKE MY MOTHER DID.
DID THAT END UP SO BAD ?
BAD ?
MY PARENTS' HOUSE...
WAS THE HAPPIEST PLACE IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
WELL, THEN.
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.
THEY WERE SO MUCH IN LOVE THAT NOTHING ELSE MATTERED.
A LOVE LIKE THAT DOESN'T COME ALONG EVERY DAY.
WELL, MAYBE -- NO !
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
MY UNCLE WILLIAM'S HEART WAS BROKEN...
WHEN MY MOTHER RAN OFF WITH MY FATHER.
THAT'S WHAT AUNT CONSTANCE SAID.
EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER GOT OVER IT,
HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE ME IN AFTER MY PARENTS DIED.
NOW I CAN MAKE UP TO HIM FOR ALL THE PAIN.
I'LL BET YOUR AUNT CONSTANCE TOLD YOU THAT, TOO.
[ Mrs. O'Halloran ] I'LL HAVE THIS FOR YOU PRESENTLY, MRS. MOONEY.
MISS BETH, SINCE YOU SO HIGHLY COMPLEMENTED ME,
I'D BE HONORED TO MAKE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
THANK YOU, MRS. O'HALLORAN.
THAT'S VERY KIND,
BUT I DON'T THINK I'LL BE GOING TO TOO MANY BALLS.
THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN DANCING.
NO DOUBT THE LORD INTENDED FOR YOU...
TO FIND YOUR HAPPINESS SOME OTHER WAY.
SEE YOU AT HOME, MOM.
BYE-BYE.
[ Doorbell ]
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M COMING !
JUST A MINUTE.
I'M COMING.
YES, GOOD EVENING.
FROM MR. BROWNING, MADAM.
THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO THE BALL ?
BEG PARDON, MADAM ?
THE BUTLER'S BALL.
JUDGING BY MY HOUSEHOLD,
THERE ISN'T A SERVANT WORKING...
IN ALL OF NEW YORK TONIGHT.
I DON'T DANCE, MADAM.
WHAT A PITY.
IF YOU'RE EVER IN NEED OF EMPLOYMENT,
I DO HOPE YOU'LL COME AND SEE ME.
THANK YOU, MADAM.
THANK YOU.
BYE-BYE.
I HEARD THE BELL.
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALFRED.
IN A WAY, IT WAS.
HE SENT YOU A NOTE.
I DO HOPE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DEAR BOY.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY, AUNT CONSTANCE.
THANK YOU, MY DARLING.
OH.
MISS BROWNING ISN'T FEELING WELL.
ALFRED FEELS HIS PLACE IS WITH HER THIS EVENING.
THEN YOU WON'T BE GOING TO THE CONCERT.
YOUR UNCLE AND I HAVE BEEN INVITED...
TO THE CHARITY DINNER AT THE FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL...
FOR THE COMMITTEE TO COLLECT CHARITY BIBLES FOR THE POOR.
WE JUST WON'T GO.
THAT'S ALL.
AND MISS THE CAVIAR, SALMON IN ASPIC ?
OH, DEAR.
SALMON IN ASPIC.
 PERHAPS I AM BEING HASTY.
BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR DINNER ?
THE SERVANTS ARE BUSY GETTING READY FOR THE PARTY.
I'M SURE COOK HAS SOMETHING IN THE ICEBOX.
I'LL BE FINE, REALLY.
HASN'T ALFRED ARRIVED YET ?
OH, HE'S NOT COMING.
AGNES IS ILL.
WHAT SHALL WE DO ?
WHATEVER BETH WISHES, OF COURSE.
WOULD YOU PREFER WE STAY AT HOME WITH YOU ?
PERHAPS YOU'D CARE TO ACCOMPANY US TO THE DINNER.
NO, THANK YOU.
I'M CONTENT TO STAY AT HOME.
I'LL WORK ON MY MUSIC.
THERE'S A DEAR, LOVELY, LEVELHEADED GIRL.
SHE'LL WORK ON HER MUSIC.
SPLENDID.
BETH, WILL YOU ?
THANK YOU, DARLING.
THERE YOU GO.
HAVE A GOOD EVENING, AND DON'T STAY UP LATE.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
I WON'T.
GOOD NIGHT, BETH.
GOOD NIGHT.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
THANK YOU.
DON'T YOU ALL LOOK HANDSOME !
I THOUGHT YOU WERE OFF.
I'M NOT GOING.
MISS BROWNING IS ILL.
AND YOU DRESSED UP LIKE A PRINCESS.
WHAT A SHAME !
IT'S NOT A SHAME, IT'S A BLESSING !
YOU CAN COME WITH US.
I DON'T THINK -- DON'T BE SILLY, MR. GRIGGS.
THIS IS AMERICA WHERE EVERYBODY'S EQUAL.
MORE'S THE PITY.
DON'T WORRY.
I CAN'T GO.
AND WHY NOT ?
I PROMISED TO WORK ON MY MUSIC.
COME UP WITH A BETTER ONE.
MY AUNT AND UNCLE WOULDN'T LIKE IT.
YOU'LL BE BACK AND NO HARM DONE.
YOU'LL FIND IT PLEASANT.
THERE'S A BUFFET.
AND DANCING AND SINGING.
[ Mr. Griggs ] I DON'T APPROVE, BUT YOU'D ENJOY YOURSELF.
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE TO ESCORT YOU HOME AT ANY HOUR.
IT'S SETTLED !
RUN AND GET YOUR CLOAK.
ALL RIGHT.
¶¶
LOOK, SIOBHAN FLAHERTY'S WEARING A BEDSPREAD.
SHE'S WEARING HER DRAPES !
HOW ARE THE VANDERBILTS DOING WITHOUT YOU, CHARLES ?
POORLY, I'M AFRAID.
YOU DON'T DANCE, DO YOU, MRS. MOONEY ?
WHATEVER GAVE YOU THAT IDEA, MR. GRIGGS ?
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
YOU BOTH DO.
THANK YOU.
DID YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING IN ?
OF COURSE NOT.
I TOLD THEM...
I WAS THE ESCORT OF THE PRETTIEST GIRL.
THEY KNEW WHO I MEANT.
I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO COME ALONE.
MY MOTHER TRUSTS MR. GRIGGS TO LOOK AFTER ME.
DOES THAT MEAN I CAN'T TAKE YOU HOME ?
WAIT AND SEE.
RUDY !
I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE WASN'T COMING.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE WASN'T COMING.
COME ON.
GOOD EVENING, MARY,
MISS ATHERTON.
[ Franz ] I CLAIM THIS DANCE.
MAY I HAVE THE HONOR OF THIS DANCE ?
OF COURSE.
 EXCUSE ME, MAY I CUT IN ?
WE DON'T DO THAT HERE.
I KNOW.
THIS IS MY SISTER AND I HAVE AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE.
IS THIS TRUE ?
YES.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO THANK ME ?
THANK YOU.
I WASN'T PLANNING ON BEING HERE TONIGHT.
I PREFER TO DANCE IN SILENCE.
FOR THE BELLE OF THE BUTLER'S BALL.
I SHOULD LIKE TO OFFER THIS AS A TRIBUTE TO YOUR BEAUTY,
IF NOT YOUR MANNERS.
THIS IS OUR DANCE.
IS IT ?
WELL, I --
I THOUGHT NOT.
OH, YOU ARE THE RUDEST --
SMILE, THE JUDGES ARE WATCHING.
I DON'T CARE WHO'S WATCHING !
OBVIOUSLY, THE LADY DOESN'T WISH TO DANCE WITH YOU !
GO AWAY.
I WILL NOT.
PERMIT ME TO -- OH !
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE !
GO AWAY !
I'LL GO AND GET HER.
DON'T CRY.
PLEASE DON'T CRY.
I'M NOT CRYING !
I JUST WANT TO DIE !
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EMBARRASSED IN MY LIFE.
YOU LOOK MORE ANGRY THAN ANYTHING.
MARY, THAT AWFUL MAN.
HE'S PRETTY PUSHY, I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.
IF HE EVER TRIES TO COME IN THE SAME ROOM, I'LL --
AND HE DESERVES EVERY BIT, TOO.
WOULDN'T YOU BE ANGRY WITH HIM ?
THAT I WOULD,
BUT IT WOULD BE MIXED WITH PLEASURE.
THAT MAN CERTAINLY FINDS YOU ATTRACTIVE.
DON'T BE SILLY.
HE HATES ME.
AND I HATE HIM.
WHAT TIME IS IT ?
WELL PAST 10:00.
I'VE GOT TO GO HOME.
HER LADYSHIP AND HIMSELF WON'T BE HOME FOR A WHILE.
I WANT TO GO.
THERE YOU ARE, AS GOOD AS NEW.
RUDY WISHES TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS BEHAVIOR.
HE IS SORRY.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.
I JUST HAVE TO LEAVE.
THEN PERMIT ME TO ESCORT YOU.
DON'T BE SILLY.
WHY SHOULD I SPOIL THE EVENING FOR YOU AND MARY ?
JUST GET ME A HACK.
I'LL BE FINE.
I'LL GET GRIGGS.
NO SUCH THING.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.
THE JUDGES HAVE MADE THEIR DECISION.
GET ME A HACK.
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.
AT LEAST LET POOR RUDY APOLOGIZE.
THE JUDGES FIND THEMSELVES AT A BIT OF A LOSS.
THEY WISH TO GIVE THE AWARD...
TO A YOUNG LADY WHOSE NAME THEY DO NOT KNOW.
WILL THE YOUNG LADY...
WITH THE CASCADING TRESSES...
THAT'S YOU.
KINDLY STEP FORWARD TO RECEIVE HER AWARD...
AS THE LOVELIEST LADY OF THE BUTLER'S BALL.
[ Murmuring ]
ARE YOU SURE -- I'M FINE, FRANZ.
THANK YOU.
AS YOU WISH.
WHERE TO, MISS ?
27 FIFTH AVENUE.
I HAVE COME TO APOLOGIZE.
I AM SORRY TO CAUSE YOU ALARM,
BUT I AM TWICE AS SORRY TO HAVE...
CAUSED YOU EMBARRASSMENT.
I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP TONIGHT...
WITHOUT YOUR FORGIVENESS.
IT'S NO CONCERN OF MINE.
THE FACT THAT I HAVE SPOILED YOUR EVENING,
MAKES IT A CONCERN OF MINE.
VERY WELL, YOU ARE FORGIVEN.
PLEASE TELL THE DRIVER TO PULL OVER...
SO YOU CAN GET OUT.
THAT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
YOU'RE STILL ANGRY WITH ME.
OF COURSE.
BOTH TIMES I'VE MET YOU, I'VE BEEN PUSHED, SHOVED,
AND MADE TO SUFFER THE INDIGNITY...
OF HAVING MY HAIR COME DOWN.
WITH HAIR SUCH AS THAT,
ITS DESCENT ONLY SERVES TO ACCENTUATE YOUR BEAUTY.
NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN HAIR...
OF SUCH LUXURIANT LENGTH.
HAS IT NEVER BEEN CUT ?
NO.
WHOEVER ISSUED THAT COMMAND WAS VERY WISE.
IT WAS MY FATHER,
AND HE DID NOT ISSUE COMMANDS.
I HAD SCARLET FEVER WHEN I WAS 3.
I HAD TO HAVE MY HAIR CUT OFF.
WHEN IT GREW BACK,
MY FATHER ASKED ME NEVER TO CUT IT.
AND I NEVER WILL.
YOU SPEAK OF YOUR FATHER IN A PAST TENSE.
Nicht wahr ?
BOTH MY PARENTS DIED WHEN I WAS A CHILD.
YESTERDAY.
I'M 18 !
FORGIVE ME ?
PLEASE, GET OUT.
YES, OF COURSE.
IT IS GETTING LATE.
WHAT TIME IS IT ?
[ Watch Chimes ]
 'TIS 11:00, PRECISELY.
HOW BEAUTIFUL.
MAY I ?
OF COURSE.
OH.
AREN'T YOU AFRAID YOU'LL LOSE IT...
CARRYING IT IN YOUR POCKET THAT WAY,
WITHOUT A CHAIN ?
I NEARLY DID THE OTHER DAY.
A HOOLIGAN TRIED TO TAKE IT.
IT IS MY MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION,
MY ONLY LINK WITH HOME.
IT BELONGED TO MY FATHER AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM.
AND WELL, I VALUE IT...
AS YOU DO YOUR HAIR.
WHOA.
HERE WE ARE, MISS.
YOU'RE GOING IN THE FRONT ENTRANCE ?
OH.
NO.
I'M GOING SKATING AT THE PARK TOMORROW AT 5:00.
I HOPE YOU WILL SKATE THERE AT THAT TIME.
I WILL NOT.
NEVERTHELESS, I SHALL HOPE THAT,
SOMEHOW, YOU'LL BE THERE.
YOU CAN HOPE ALL YOU WANT FOR THE GOOD IT WILL DO YOU.
REMEMBER, 5:00.
[ Hack Driver ] HEY, WHERE'S MY MONEY ?
WANT ME TO TAKE YOU BACK ?
HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU ?
50 CENTS.
THAT IS ALL I HAVE.
I SHALL WALK BACK.
[ Sigh ] THANK YOU, DEAR.
BETH, WHY AREN'T YOU IN BED ?
DON'T TELL ME YOU SPENT THE EVENING...
SITTING IN THAT EXPENSIVE DRESS.
GOOD EVENING.
DID YOU HAVE A PLEASANT TIME ?
IT WAS...
PASSABLE,
BUT THERE WAS NO SALMON IN ASPIC.
ANYWAY, WHY AREN'T YOU IN BED ?
I'M TIRED.
BETH'S INTERROGATION...
CAN WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING.
NO !
I MEAN, I'D RATHER TELL YOU NOW.
I WENT TO THE BUTLER'S BALL.
WHAT ?
OH, BETH !
HOW COULD YOU ?
IT JUST ISN'T DONE !
DO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WENT OUT AT NIGHT...
WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION ?
THAT MARY O'HALLORAN !
I TOLD MYSELF...
NO GOOD WOULD COME OF A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP...
BETWEEN MY NIECE AND THE LOWER CLASSES.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU HAD TOLD BETH.
 YES, WILLIAM, OF COURSE.
BETH, HOW ULD YOU LET YOURSELF...
BE LED ASTRAY BY -- IT WASN'T MARY'S IDEA.
SHE EVEN INSISTED THAT I LEAVE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHOSE IDEA.
BETH IS OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG.
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, BETH.
I'VE BEEN RELATIVELY EASY, IN MY MIND, ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR,
KNOWING THAT YOU'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY MY DEAR SISTER,
AND THEN TURNED OVER TO YOUR AUNT CONSTANCE'S --
WELL, I HAVE NOT SEEN FIT TO DEAL HARSHLY WITH YOU.
NOW ALL THAT HAS CHANGED.
YOUR BEHAVIOR TONIGHT HAS SHOWN...  A DISTRESSING LACK OF RESTRAINT.
OH, WILLIAM, SHE'LL NEVER GO TO...
THE BUTLER'S BALL AGAIN, WILL YOU, DEAR ?
I CAN UNDERSTAND SNEAKING OUT...
TO GO TO MRS. ASTOR'S, BUT A HALL FULL OF SERVANTS ?
THE SOCIAL STANDING OF THE COMPANY BETH CHOOSES...
TO SNEAK AWAY TO IS OF NO IMPORTANCE.
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS SHE'S NOT TO BE TRUSTED.
YOU WILL SEE TO IT SHE NEVER LEAVES THE HOUSE...
UNLESS SHE IS PROPERLY ACCOMPANIED.
OH, BETH, I AM SURPRISED.
MARY ?
WAIT, DON'T GO.
COME HERE, DEAR.
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU.
I UNDERSTAND IT WAS BECAUSE OF YOU...
MY NIECE DIDN'T STAY AT THAT --
BALL.
YES, BALL.
I COMMEND YOUR COMMON SENSE.
OH,
THANK YOU, MA'AM.
NEVERTHELESS,
I MUST FORBID ANY FURTHER ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOU.
MY MOTHER WILL BE THAT UPSET, MA'AM.
SHE LOVES MISS BETH...
LIKE ONE OF HER OWN.
IT DOES SEEM HARSH, DOESN'T IT ?
IT'S MR. SCHUYLER'S WISH.
YES, MA'AM.
WILL THAT BE ALL, MA'AM ?
YES, DEAR, YOU MAY GO NOW.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, MA'AM.
GOOD NIGHT, MISS BETH.
GOOD NIGHT.
THERE, MY DARLING,
DON'T LOOK SO DOWNHEARTED.
EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.
YOU AND I WILL BE ABLE TO SPEND EVERY MOMENT TOGETHER.
WE'LL GO SHOPPING, BETH.
SHOPPING, DEAR.
LUNCHES AT DELMONICO'S, PETIT FOURS, SODAS,
AND GOBS AND GOBS OF WHIPPED CREAM.
I DON'T LIKE WHIPPED CREAM.
WELL, NEVER MIND.
I'LL EAT YOUR PORTION, TOO.
YES, I THINK IT WOULD BE PROPER.
WE SHALL ASK YOUR UNCLE IF IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT...
TO BUY YOUR ENGAGEMENT PRESENT NOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
ISN'T THAT EXCITING ?
YES, AUNT CONSTANCE.
COME ON, DARLING.
AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL ?
WATCH CHAINS, DEAR ?
WHY WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN A WATCH CHAIN ?
ALFRED DOESN'T WEAR A WATCH.
GOOD MORNING, MRS. SCHUYLER.
HELLO.
WHAT MAY WE DO FOR YOU TODAY ?
I'M HERE TO BUY A PRESENT FOR MY NIECE.
OF COURSE.
MADAM.
 WAS THERE SOMETHING SPECIAL YOU HAD IN MIND ?
MR. SCHUYLER AND I THOUGHT A SIMPLE STRING OF PEARLS,
UNLESS YOU PREFER SOMETHING ELSE, DEAR.
WHEN RUDY TOLD ME, I SAID HE MUST BE MISTAKEN.
THE LADY WAS PLAYING A CRUEL TRICK...
COMMON TO PEOPLE IN HER STATION.
YOU ALLOWED IT, WHICH FORCES ME TO CHANGE MY ESTIMATION OF YOU.
I'D HAVE THOUGHT BETTER OF YOU.
STOP, BOTH OF YOU !
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING OF ME,
MAYBE I DESERVE.
THAT STUFF ABOUT BETH IS JUST RUBBISH !
"A TRICK COMMON TO PEOPLE IN HER STATION."
WHAT STATION ?
THIS ISN'T EUROPE.
SHE'S NOT A PRINCESS, BUT A POOR ORPHAN...
FORCED TO MARRY A MAN SHE DOESN'T LOVE.
SHE CAME WITH ME FOR A BIT OF FUN.
AND REPRESENTED HERSELF AS SOMEONE SHE WAS NOT !
MY IDEA !
SHE DID NOTHING TO CHANGE MY BELIEF SHE WAS A MAID.
WHY SHOULD SHE ?
WHY SHOULD I BE DEFENDING US LIKE I'M IN THE DOCKET ?
I WOULD PREFER THAT YOU BOTH LEAVE !
WITH PLEASURE.
FOREIGNERS !
I WOULD PREFER THE PLEASURE OF WATCHING YOU SKATE.
MY INEPT PERFORMANCE WILL ONLY RUIN YOUR PERFECT EXECUTION.
DON'T BE ABSURD.
SKATING IS GOOD FOR YOUR WEAK ANKLES.
DON'T LEAN ON US, DEAR.
PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR TWO FEET.
I'M TRYING.
YOU'RE DOING FINE, ALFRED.
HE'S NOT LEANING ON ME.
I SUGGEST THE 2 OF YOU SKATE TOGETHER.
THAT MIGHT BE UNFAIR TO BETH.
I'M SURE BETH WOULD ENJOY IT.
WOULD YOU ?
OF COURSE.
PERFECT !
ALFRED, YOU RELAX.
TRY TO ENJOY YOURSELVES.
READY, ALFRED ?
RIGHT FOOT FIRST.
AH-HA.
Entschuldigen, mein Herr ?
I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOUR COURAGEOUS ATTEMPTS...
TO MASTER THE ART OF THE ICE SKATING.
I SHOULD LIKE TO BE OF ASSISTANCE.
I AM A TEACHER OF THE SPORT.
THAT'S KIND, BUT IT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
I BEG TO DISAGREE WITH THE Fraulein.
IF THE GENTLEMAN CONTINUES TO FOLD HIS ANKLES IN,
HE MAY DO GREAT DAMAGE TO HIMSELF.
I'VE HAD WEAK ANKLES SINCE CHILDHOOD.
I DOUBT ANY ASSISTANCE -- AHH !
THIS IS WHERE YOU ARE MISTAKEN, mein Herr.
PERMIT ME.
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT.
REALLY ?
ARE YOU GAME ?
ALFRED, I'M SURE IF WE SKATE --
WE ASSUME THE PARTNER POSITION.
PERHAPS YOU MIGHT HOLD THE GENTLEMAN...
A LITTLE TIGHTER !
GOOD.
ONE, AND TWO,
AND THREE.
STRAIGHTEN THOSE ANKLES.
FIVE, AND SIX.
LET'S STOP.
AAAH !
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
GO AWAY.
OH, THAT WAS VERY GOOD...
FOR THE FIRST LESSON.
IN NO TIME YOU WILL BE...
SKIMMING OVER THE ICE LIKE A BIRD.
I DOUBT IT.
BUT YOU WILL.
SHALL I SHOW YOU HOW YOU'LL LOOK...
ONE MONTH FROM NOW ?
[ Owl Hoots ]
[ Gasp ]
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN MY ANGER...
WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING SO BEAUTIFUL.
YOUR ANGER ?
YOU WERE DELIBERATELY MAKING FOOLS OF ALFRED AND ME.
DO NOT YOU THINK I DESERVE A BIT OF REVENGE ?
NO.
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU ?
YOU ALLOWED ME TO BEGIN TO...
FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU,
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ENGAGED TO ANOTHER MAN.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO ALL THAT.
NEVERTHELESS, YOU DID.
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT I WAS ENGAGED ?
YOU AND YOUR AUNT CAME INTO THE SHOP WHERE I WORK.
I WAS SITTING NO MORE THAN 5 FEET AWAY...
WHEN SHE BOUGHT YOU A STRING OF PEARLS...
AS AN ENGAGEMENT PRESENT.
OH, RUDY, I'M SORRY.
WELL, AFTER SEEING YOUR FIANCE, I'M RELIEVED.
AT LEAST MARY WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT.
ABOUT WHAT ?
YOU ARE ENTERING INTO...
AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE.
WELL, YES.
I WON'T TELL CONSTANCE YOU LET A STRANGE MAN...
SKATE OFF WITH YOUR FIANCE.
HOW COULD YOU HAVE BEEN SO IMPRUDENT, ALFRED ?
IT CAN'T BE.
ALFRED !
IT IS.
DON'T MUMBLE, DEAR.
DO BE QUIET, AGNES.
I MAY HAVE SEEN A SNOWY OWL.
OH, REALLY, ALFRED.
I, TOO, HAVE AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE...
WHEN I GO BACK TO SWITZERLAND.
IT IS NOT A CHARMING PROSPECT,
BUT DUTY DECREES.
DID YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAID...
ABOUT BEGINNING TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ME ?
I SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT.
WE BOTH KNOW WE'RE COMMITTED ELSEWHERE.
NOT OFFICIALLY.
NOT OFFICIALLY.
SURELY IT COULD DO NO HARM...
IF YOU AND I WERE TO MEET, INNOCENTLY, OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.
I'M AFRAID THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
EXCEPT FOR THE DAYS WHEN I WORK AT THE SETTLEMENT HOUSE,
MY AUNT DOESN'T ALLOW ME OUT OF HER SIGHT.
WHAT SETTLEMENT HOUSE ?
RIVINGTON STREET.
I ENTERTAIN IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WHILE THEIR MOTHERS WORK.
IT'S FATE.
I WORK AT THE RIVINGTON SETTLEMENT HOUSE.
I TEACH ENGLISH TO GERMAN, AUSTRIAN IMMIGRANTS.
I ARRIVE EVERY MONDAY AND THURSDAY AT 7:00.
I'M AFRAID I LEAVE AT 6:00.
PERHAPS I COULD ARRIVE AT 6:30.
THEN I SHALL STAY 'TIL 7:00.
OH !
TOMORROW'S MONDAY !
I THANK YOU, Fraulein.
AND NOW, auf Wiedersehen.
AT LEAST HE SEEMS A GENTLEMAN.
YES.
A PERFECT GENTLEMAN.
 THERE YOU GO.
HERE'S YOUR MOTHER, JAN.
HE IS A GOOD BOY ?
VERY GOOD.
RIGHT, JAN ?
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO SIT DOWN.
YOU LOOK SO TIRED.
NO, I MUST GO.
IT IS TIME I COOK.
BUT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE 7:00 THIS MORNING.
FIRST I COOK, THEN I WASH,
THEN I SLEEP.
THIS IS AMERICA.
FAREWELL.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, JAN.
[ Banging ]
OH, WHAT AN AWFUL NOISE.
[ German ]
IF YOU WANT A SONG, YOU MUST ASK IN ENGLISH.
I...
WOULD LIKE...
WOULD LIKE...
A SONG, PLEASE.
A SONG, PLEASE.
NOW SAY IT ALL AT ONCE.
I WOULD LIKE A SONG, PLEASE.
WONDERFUL.
I'LL SING THE SONG MY FATHER WROTE FOR ME...
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.
¶¶ [ Pipe Organ ]
¶ IF YOU WILL COME WITH ME ¶
¶ I WILL SHARE WITH YOU MY VISION ¶
¶ AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE ¶
¶ THE WAY YOUR FUTURE WILL BE ¶
¶ WHEN ALL MY PRAYERS COME TRUE ¶
¶ YOU'LL HAVE PEACE ¶
¶ AND JOY FOREVER ¶
¶ AND EVERMORE ¶
¶ AND ONE THING MORE FOR YOU ¶

¶ MAY YOU HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ¶
¶ THE PRECIOUS GIFT OF LOVE ¶¶
NO ONE SANG FOR ME LIKE THAT...
WHEN I ARRIVED FROM EUROPE.
I AM SORRY.
IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.
AREN'T YOU HUNGRY ?
GOOD NIGHT, LIESL.
SAY "GOOD NIGHT" TO THE Fraulein.
Guten abend.
Guten abend.
NOW, PERHAPS,
YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR ATTENTION.
I DID NOT SLEEP WELL LAST NIGHT.
OH, I'M SORRY.
I DO NOT DESERVE YOUR PITY.
WITH WHAT I WAS THINKING,
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO BE AWAKE.
AND WHAT WAS THAT ?
WELL, THAT I HAD FOUND...
A BEAUTIFUL AND EXCITING FRIEND.
FRIEND ?
YES, OF COURSE.
FRIEND.
I'D RATHER USE ANOTHER WORD.
NO, YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT.
WE WILL BE FRIENDS,
THAT'S ALL.
JUST FRIENDS.
YES.
NOW THAT THAT IS SETTLED,
WILL YOU DO YOUR FRIEND THE HONOR...
OF SINGING THAT LOVELY SONG AGAIN ?
I DO NOT REMEMBER HEARING IT BEFORE.
YOU COULDN'T HAVE.
IT'S MINE.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST A SONG MY FATHER WROTFOR ME.
HE GAVE IT TO ME FOR THE FIRST TIME...
ON MY 5th BIRTHDAY.
FIRST TIME ?
YES.
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVERY YEAR.
MY FATHER SAID THAT NO MATTER WHAT OTHER GIFTS I MIGHT GET,
THE ONE THAT WAS PRICELESS WAS THE GIFT OF LOVE.
HE WANTED ME ALWAYS TO HAVE THAT.
YOUR FATHER MUST HAVE BEEN A WONDERFUL MAN.
BOTH MY PARENTS WERE WONDERFUL,
AND SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.
I DON'T THINK MY MOTHER EVER REGRETTED...
RUNNING OFF TO MARRY HIM.
HE GAVE WHAT ALL THE SCHUYLER MONEY COULDN'T BUY.
I DO NOT THINK YOUR FATHER...
WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH YOUR MARRIAGE PLANS.
IF WE MEET AFTER TONIGHT,
"IF" ?
IT HAS TO BE ON THE UNDERSTANDING...
THAT WE WILL NOT DISCUSS...
EITHER MY MARRIAGE OR YOURS.
WE WILL ONLY MEET TO DEEPEN OUR FRIENDSHIP.
AGREED ?
AGREED.
THERE.
OF COURSE,
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T TELL ME ABOUT...
THE YOUNG LADY.
"THE YOUNG LADY" ?
YES.
YES.
YOU MEAN HILDA.
YES.
HILDA.
YOU ARE DARK, SHE IS BLONDE.
YOU ARE ADORABLE...
AND PETITE,
AND SHE IS --
WAGNERIAN.
YOU HAVE A VOICE LIKE A THRUSH,
AND SHE SINGS LIKE A TURKEY.
YOU'RE MAKING IT UP.
OF COURSE.
HOW ELSE CAN I TELL ONLY A FRIEND HOW WONDERFUL SHE IS ?
YOU MUSTN'T.
YOU ARE WARM, SOFT.
SHE IS LIKE A GLACIER.
¶¶
DELICIOUS DINNER AS USUAL, CONSTANCE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, AGNES.
YOU SEEM VERY QUIET THIS EVENING, BETH.
AREN'T YOU FEELING WELL ?
I'M FINE, MISS BROWNING.
SHE'S WORN-OUT...
WORKING AT THAT SETTLEMENT HOUSE...
AS THOUGH HER LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.
I HOPE YOU'LL STOP AFTER YOU MARRY ALFRED.
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT DREADFUL DISEASES THOSE IMMIGRANTS BRING,
AND ALFRED IS SO SUSCEPTIBLE.
MY WIFE TELLS ME YOU WANT TO ACCELERATE THE WEDDING PLANS.
IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION.
BUT I THOUGHT YOU, CONSTANCE, AND BETH...
HAD YOUR HEART SET ON A JUNE WEDDING.
NO, JUNE WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE.
WHY ?
BECAUSE I'M DELIVERING MY PAPER ON JUNE 3rd.
WE WOULD HAVE TO SET SAIL SEVERAL WEEKS EARLIER.
WHAT PAPER ?
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.
I'M SPEAKING ON THE WHITE-CRESTED SPARROW...
AT THE ROYAL ORNITHOLOGICAL INSTITUTE IN LONDON.
SURELY AGNES WOULD HAVE MENTIONED IT TO YOU.
IT'S A GREAT HONOR.
THE WHITE-CRESTED SPARROW ?
OH, FANCY THAT !
YOU MUST BE VERY PLEASED, ALFRED.
DOESN'T IT ALL WORK OUT BEAUTIFULLY ?
WHAT A HONEYMOON !
FIRST ENGLAND, THEN SWITZERLAND.
NO !
NOT SWITZERLAND.
BETH, SWITZERLAND IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST.
THAT'S THE HOME OF PROFESSOR EINBERG,
THE WORLD'S AUTHORITY ON FOREST BIRDS.
WE SHALL HAVE TO GET READY FOR THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY.
TOMORROW IS THANKSGIVING,
AND THEN WE'RE RIGHT INTO THE HOLIDAY SEASON.
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE OUTSIDE OF THE PARTY.
WE SHOULD START ON THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS.
AREN'T YOU EXCITED ?
A HONEYMOON IN EUROPE.
BETH, I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.
AREN'T YOU EXCITED ?
A HONEYMOON IN EUROPE.
OH, YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY GIRL.
YES, I KNOW.
I'M A VERY LUCKY GIRL.
¶¶ [ Festive Music ]
RUDY !
RUDY, OVER HERE.
I HAD TO WORK LATE.
I AM SORRY.
I HAVE TO LEAVE.
I'M LATE AS IT IS.
LOOKS VERY FESTIVE.
YES.
SEE THAT TURKEY ?
LIESL MADE IT.
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THANKSGIVING.
SHE THINKS IT'S A CELEBRATION IN HONOR OF TURKEYS.
YOU DID PROMISE ME A DANCE.
I HAVE TO LEAVE.
YOU SAID YOU WERE LATE ALREADY.
A FEW MORE MINUTES WON'T MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE.
PLEASE ?
JUST ONE.
¶¶
WE SAID WE WOULDN'T.
HOW COULD WE HELP IT ?
HOW COULD I HELP IT ?
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.
NOT JUST YOU --
RUDY, PLEASE.
I MUST.
OUR MEETINGS HAVE SHOWN ME HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME.
I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE MAKING YOU HAPPY.
AND I FEEL THE SAME ABOUT YOU.
NO.
THIS IS WRONG.
YOU HAVE YOUR DUTY, AND I HAVE MINE.
YOU ARE RIGHT.
OF COURSE.
WE MUST SAY GOOD-BYE,
NOW.
NOT BEFORE WE HAVE...
ONE LAST DANCE TOGETHER.
I WILL CHERISH IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
[ Thunder ]
WE ALWAYS PLANNED TO GO HOME IN APRIL.
3 YEARS WE SAID, AND 3 YEARS WE'LL STAY.
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
NOT FOR ME.
YOU STAY ON.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
WE CAME TOGETHER, AND WE'LL GO TOGETHER.
I STOPPED BY THE STEAMSHIP OFFICE.
WE CAN GET TICKETS ON THE BREMENHAVEN.
SAILING ONE WEEK FROM TODAY.
YOU THINK RUNNING AWAY WILL HELP ?
IN TIME, SOMEDAY.
AFTER I'VE BEEN HOME,
 AND I'M SURROUNDED BY FAMILIAR THINGS,
ALL THIS WILL SEEM LIKE A DREAM.
AND IN THE MEANTIME ?
I WILL TRY TO FEEL LIKE THE UNEMOTIONAL SWISS...
WHO HIDES HOW ROMANTIC I REALLY AM.
SURE.
OF COURSE.
YOUR AUNT WANTS ME TO HELP YOU GET READY.
MR. BROWNING WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.
THANK YOU, MARY.
THE WHOLE THING'S A CRYING SHAME.
PLEASE DON'T START THAT AGAIN.
WHY NOT ?
WOULDN'T YOU TRY AND STOP ME...
IF I WAS THROWING MY LIFE AWAY ?
I'M NOT THROWING MY LIFE AWAY.
I'M JUST DOING WHAT'S EXPECTED OF ME.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
I LIKE ALFRED.
YOU KNOW THAT.
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME --
NO !
I'M TRYING...
TO TELL ME.
BETH, ARE YOU READY ?
- DON'T GO.
- I MUST.
I ADMIRE YOUR BUSINESS ACUMEN.
THAT'S A VERY HANDSOME SUM.
NOT AS LARGE AS ALFRED'S FORTUNE,
BUT HANDSOME NEVERTHELESS.
QUITE HANDSOME.
I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS IN MY FATHER'S WILL.
IF MY SISTER, BETH'S MOTHER, MARRIED WITHOUT MY APPROVAL,
HER SHARE OF OUR FATHER'S FORTUNE...
WAS TO BE HELD IN TRUST FOR ANY CHILDREN SHE MIGHT HAVE.
SINCE BETH IS HER ONLY ISSUE,
THE ENTIRE AMOUNT GOES TO MY NIECE ON HER WEDDING DAY,
ASSUMING SHE MARRIES WITH MY APPROVAL.
THERE'S NO WORRY THERE.
SHALL WE GET ON WITH IT ?
IS SOMETHING WRONG, ALFRED ?
EVERYTHING'S WRONG.
I FIND IT ALMOST LIKE BEING TREATED LIKE A COMMODITY.
I KNOW JUST HOW YOU FEEL.
I FIND THIS ALL VERY PAINFUL.
THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD I WOULD WANT TO DO IS HURT YOU.
YOU'RE A VERY KIND PERSON, BETH.
SO ARE YOU.
LIFE CAN BE VERY PAINFUL FOR KIND PEOPLE.
THAT'S TRUE.
WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE MARRIED TO EACH OTHER, DO WE ?
WELL, I --
COME ON.
OUT WITH IT.
WELL, THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE.
FOR ME, TOO.
NOT SOMEONE,
BUT SOMETHING:
MY ORNITHOLOGY.
I HAD PLANNED TO SPEND MY LIFE IN SEARCH OF RARE SPECIES,
IN PLACES THAT NO LADY WOULD WANT TO GO.
I KNOW I SEEM TIMID SOMETIMES,
BUT WHEN I'M ON THE TRAIL...
OF A RELUCTANT BIRD, I KNOW NO FEAR.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SOMEONE ELSE ?
DIDN'T HE RETURN YOUR LOVE ?
OH, YES.
THEN WHY AREN'T YOU WITH HIM, INSTEAD OF BEING SOLD TO ME ?
WE WERE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
CAN IT BE THE RIGHT THING...
TO MAKE THE WRONG PEOPLE HAPPY,
AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE MISERABLE ?
ISN'T IT FORTUNATE THAT THESE TWO LARGE SUMS ARE MERGING...
JUST IN TIME TO ENABLE US TO BUY THAT PIECE OF PROPERTY ?
MOST OF ALFRED'S HOLDINGS ARE IN STOCKS.
THE MAJORITY IS IN UNION PACIFIC.
UH-HUH.
UNION PACIFIC WENT UP 3 POINTS YESTERDAY TO 242.
IT'S FOR YOU, MISS BETH.
THANK YOU.

GO TO YOUR ROOM.
PLEASE, UNCLE WILLIAM.
PERMIT ME TO MAKE MY POSITION CLEAR.
YOU'VE MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR.

WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS ?
I HOPE NOT TO CAUSE PAIN, BUT FROM NOW ON,
I INTEND TO LIVE MY LIFE TO PLEASE MYSELF,
AS SHOULD EVERYONE.
ALFRED.
I WOULD LIKE A WORD WITH YOU NOW.
[ Alfred ] I WILL SPEAK WITH YOU NOW.

BE QUIET, CONSTANCE.
BETH, GO TO YOUR ROOM.
NO, I WILL NOT.
I FULLY UNDERSTAND MY OBLIGATION TO YOU,
AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR ME,
BUT ALFRED AND I ARE NOT IN LOVE.
I LOVE RUDY.
THE AMALGAMATION OF YOUR 2 FORTUNES...
WILL MAKE YOU A RICH WOMAN.
IF I DON'T GO AFTER RUDY, I'LL LOSE HIM.
I AM TELLING YOU...
WHAT I TOLD YOUR MOTHER.
YOU GO OUT THAT DOOR, NEVER COME BACK.
OH, WILLIAM.
CONSTANCE, BE QUIET.
 UNCLE WILLIAM, I'M SORRY.

IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.
THE STREETS MAY NOT BE PAVED WITH GOLD,

WHY DON'T WE WALK AROUND THE DECK...

AFTER ALL, IT'S THE END OF OUR BACHELOR DAYS.
ALL ASHORE THAT'S GOING ASHORE.
FRANZ,
TAKE THIS TO MY MOTHER.
TELL HER I WILL WRITE.
YOU CAN'T.
THINK OF YOUR OBLIGATIONS.
I AM.
EVERY PENNY I HAVE EARNED IS IN THIS POUCH,

 CLOSED-CAPTIONED BY CAPTIONS, INC.
LOS ANGELES
Are you satisfied now?
We've been around this corridor three times... and we ain't seen nothing.
You do what you want to do.
I'm going to the back, listen to the radio, and have me some supper.
What in tarnation has gotten into you?
Come on, let's get out of here!
You've heard about the building that collapsed last night.
This is what's left of two other buildings.
The city's trying to figure out what caused them to collapse.
All the night watchman could tell us was that he heard noises just before.
Noises?
Like what?
He said they sounded like... a million little saws or teeth...
I don't know.
He wasn't much help.
Have you found any common denominators?
Possibly one.
Ownership of all the buildings was traced back to a parent company.
GDH Enterprises.
Gideon D. Harcourt.
They invented the phrase "industrial giant"... just to describe him, I hear.
You think it's sabotage?
We really don't have any evidence to that effect.
But considering the fact that quite a few buildings in this town... are traced back to his corporation...
We'd better find out.
Yes?
Have you had the opportunity to read the newspaper today, Mr. Harcourt?
Another one of your buildings is on the front page.
Exactly as you predicted.
I don't know how or why you're doing this, but I do know you have a price.
What is it?
Hard as it may be for your materialistic little mind to grasp, Mr. Harcourt...
I don't want money.
I want you to shut down the Easton chemical plant.
Ecological blackmail?
That's absurd.
You will shut down your operations at the plant immediately.
Cancel any and all shipments you planned to make of the EF-11 pesticide.
And destroy the EF-11 formula.
Or I will destroy you.
You listen to me.
I didn't build an empire heeding threats from people like you... whoever you are.
Well, then... prepare to see that empire crumble, Mr. Harcourt.
My name, by the way... is Formicida.
Diana Prince.
Diana, this is Dr. Douglas Radcliffe.
We met at the Western Securities and Science Conference.
Radcliffe.
Oh, right.
The chemist.
I'm being followed.
I know who's responsible for those buildings caving in.
You do?
How?
I can't talk now.
Meet me outside the old warehouse... on Jefferson and 55th, at 6:30.
No one will be around then.
I'll tell you everything, but please, Diana, just be there.
Afraid we lost him.
You may have lost him... but I just heard from another one of my employees.
Doug intends to meet someone later.
He doesn't know it yet... but he's going to meet us, too.
Diana?
In here, Doug.
You check back in there.
Okay, boys.
The fun's over.
Oh, no, Wonder Woman.
It's just begun.
Dr. Radcliffe and I have an appointment.
Hello, Doug.
How's your head?
The least you could do was tell that goon squad of yours to take it easy on me.
Especially that witch.
What rock did you find her under?
Would you like something to drink?
Stop simpering.
I knew you were the one sabotaging Harcourt's buildings.
And that's why I'm here.
Isn't it?
I couldn't let you tell anyone, Doug.
You know what, Irene, you should cut the charming hostess routine.
It hardly becomes a jail keeper.
You should never have sold my pesticide to GDH Enterprise.
Our pesticide, Irene.
I worked on it, too, you know.
It was wrong.
I needed the money.
I offered you half.
You wouldn't take that or any of the credit either.
It isn't the money that made it wrong.
Most people do what they have to do, and then get on with it.
You never learned how to do that, have you, Irene?
Lives are at stake, Doug.
Irene, I'm really sorry for making you go through all that.
I don't hold anything against you, Doug.
You don't?
No.
Not really.
I believe that.
You've always been a decent person.
I'm really sorry for putting down what you're trying to do.
If you'd let me, I really would like to help you.
I don't believe it.
It's true.
It really is.
We worked together once.
We can work together again.
Let's clear this whole thing up together.
Okay?
- Cut it out!
- Come on.
Just stop it!
Cawley!
Oh, come on.
- Take him downstairs!
- This is-
I have learned a few things, Doug.
I may still be a simpering weakling... but I've learned that there are ways to take care of users like you!
You're in a lot more trouble than you think, Irene.
I already made contact with an IADC agent.
It's just a matter of time before they blow your little crusade wide open.
I know who you're meeting.
Her name is Diana Prince.
Cawley.
This is kidnapping, Irene.
Don't make it worse on yourself.
Irene?
Radcliffe, Douglas Emory, holder of a doctorate in biochemistry from Ohio.
That's him.
I'm looking for any connection between him and GDH Enterprises.
Did you say something else?
No.
I was just yawning, Ira.
It's because it's late, not because I'm bored.
Perhaps you Would like to hear a joke?
No, thanks anyway.
Just the information on Radcliffe.
Six months ago GDH Enterprises... purchased a formula from Dr. Douglas Radcliffe.
A pesticide?
Ten-to-one it's the pesticide that Harcourt's starting to market tomorrow.
It's called EF-11.
Have you seen this?
And 10-to-1, whoever is making disaster areas... out of Harcourt's buildings... is also responsible for Doug's kidnapping.
Doug's kidnapping?
I went to meet him and... he was abducted in front of my very eyes.
This is the only clue I could find.
Ants?
They literally chewed their way through solid flooring.
And in an isolated area.
Like they were being controlled, or something.
Ira, a quick readout.
That would sound a lot more incredible... if we hadn't just been talking about pesticides.
My thoughts exactly.
Identification ofbiological life form.
Input completed.
Phylum:
Arthropoda.
Class:
Insecta.
Order:
Hymenoptera.
Family:
Formicidae.
In plain English, please.
Specimens are carpenter ants...
Well known for their ability to tunnel through Wood.
Ants.
One more thing, Ira.
Would you please cross-index Radcliffe... and/or GDH Enterprises with anyone in the scientific community... specializing in ants.
And give her a readout tomorrow.
Do you realize how late it is?
Look at this.
Now I do.
No wonder I was yawning.
Tomorrow, Ira, and sweet dreams.
I wonder what Ira would dream about?
I shudder to think.
Good night, Rover.
A roving computer module such as yourself... could be of special value in this investigation.
Are you ready for programming?
Prepare circuits B-4 through CM-2 for programming.
Success achieved again.
Hello?
You failed to shut down the Easton chemical plant today, Mr. Harcourt.
Phone calls in the middle of the night?
You're cheapening your act, Formicida.
So it looks like tomorrow I'm going to have to hit a little closer to home.
Sorry, but I'm not frightened.
Yet.
Just like you haven't destroyed the EF-11 formula, yet.
The extra security guards arrived a half-hour ago... and have been briefed, as have the staff.
If she appears, we'll have her, Mr. Harcourt.
Good.
And the Easton plant called.
They're sending over some classified material.
That's fine.
Place this in the inner office.
After it's delivered, I'd advise leaving the building quickly.
Oh yes, he's expecting this.
You may go right up.
Hi.
May I help you?
I'd like to see Mr. Harcourt please.
Mr. Harcourt has no appointments for this morning.
He's not really expecting me at a certain time.
- I've called, but-
- You've called?
Yes.
I told him I'd be here.
I'm sure that Mr. Harcourt will want to talk to me... when he finds out who I am.
Guards!
Stop her!
Here's the package from the Easton plant, Mr. Harcourt.
Your eyes only.
And sir, we just got a warning from the lobby.
- She's in the building?
- It appears so.
Hi.
You may leave us.
What are you running here?
A business or an army?
I'd prefer to keep this entire affair away from the press.
But if you fail to cooperate, I warn you.
I have the power to have you locked up for the rest of your life.
Mr. Harcourt, you've made some mistake-
And I will not be trifled with by backward-thinking fanatics.
If your guards would give me my purse, I will show you my ID.
You do not want ski resorts.
You clamor against nuclear power.
And you rail against all progress in the name of ecology.
Did you hear that?
With the world on the edge of starvation... you will deprive it of the one pesticide... that would insure a continued food supply.
What was that?
It's coming from your office.
What is happening?
My Louis XIV table!
My 19th-century walnut desk!
What in the world...
Ants.
Ants, Mr. Harcourt.
Ants.
Relax.
Take a little break on company time.
- They're in.
- And so are we.
It was amazing, Steve.
Those ants seemed to be programmed to destroy Harcourt's office.
Harcourt was frightened enough to admit to me that... someone was trying to make him close the Easton plant.
But not frightened enough to comply.
Right.
Which means that whoever's behind this... will undoubtedly try something else.
He or she is apparently determined to stop Harcourt from marketing pesticide.
Here comes our man.
This must be from Ira.
The information you asked for last night.
Let's see.
Dr. Irene Janus... worked closely with Radcliffe in developing the EF-11 formula.
She's an entomologist with an intense interest in ants.
Look familiar?
This is not the woman I saw when Doug was kidnapped.
In light of her former relationship to him and her interest in ants...
I think maybe I'd better go visiting.
Got her address right here.
What's wrong with him?
Steve, take a look at this.
Ants.
You don't suppose that-
I've heard of places being bugged before, but this is ridiculous.
How did he know that they were there?
Our ever-faithful computer.
Ira.
Ira told me this morning that he programmed the Rover to respond to... and even generate electronic patterns emitted by ants.
You mean that... he can communicate with them?
In crude fashion, yes.
In that case, little buddy, we are about to take a trip.
It seems that good Dr. Janus is going to have company.
Mr. Harcourt, you've got to look at the latest analysis reports on EF-11.
We've been testing it on laboratory animals.
I'm going out to the Easton plant.
It has the potential of being more than 100 times as toxic as DDT, Mr. Harcourt.
Countries intending to buy EF-11 will be using a minimum of 3 pounds per acre.
Roughly the equivalent of 300 pounds of DDT.
It's supposed to be powerful.
But when it combines with water and specific pollutants... it becomes toxic.
Not just to insects... but to wildlife and eventually to humans.
The tests prove it.
Then redo the tests.
- What?
- Redo the tests.
Rover, can you tell me if...
Rover!
I'll be with you in a moment, Diana.
It's all right, Dr. Janus.
Chopin is one of my favorites.
It's not often I have an audience.
Oh?
Doesn't...
Dr. Radcliffe like music?
I know he's here, Doctor.
I'm not certain why or how, but I know that you kidnapped him.
Just like I know that you're the one... making the threats on Harcourt's pesticide plant.
I'm afraid you're going to regret your involvements in all this, Diana.
The IADC is involved, not just me.
And they know I'm here.
We crusaders are a dangerous lot.
Aldo!
Right here.
No one is to enter these gates today.
You hear?
No one.
Let's go.
I can almost hear the questions... going round and round in your respective heads:
How can a plain... passive... mousy little person like her... expect to make GDH Enterprises knuckle under?
Here, ladies and gentlemen... here's your answer.
A hormonal formula...
I developed from my ant friends themselves.
Being so weak and shy... is what interested me in ants in the first place.
This potion helps me unlock those latent and natural abilities in myself... which coincide with those of the ants.
Hymenoptera:
Formicidae.
They're everything I'm not:
Social... well-organized... purposeful, and strong.
Did you know an ant can lift over 50 times its body weight?
What's the matter, Doug?
I'm still not your type?
What a shame.
Why haven't you put this... discovery...
- to good use instead of-
- I am putting it to good use.
Go on, Doug, tell her what I'm doing!
What's she talking about?
The EF-11 pesticide formula.
I sold it too soon.
What he sold Harcourt was an incomplete formula.
Incomplete because in its present form...
EF-11, when saturated with ordinary water... and exposed to airborne sulfates, becomes a deadly poison.
Our tests weren't really conclusive.
Not when you sold out to Harcourt for over $1 million worth of nightlife.
But mine were.
Two months later.
Within four years, EF-11 will seep into the food chain of those countries... using it and cause irreversible damage.
It'll make DDT look like nothing.
Harcourt starts marketing it today.
I'll help you stop him.
I found out the surest way to see that something doesn't get done... is to trust it to government bureaucrats.
Cawley, Aldo.
No.
I've made other plans.
Goodbye.
They're flesh-eaters.
Doug, I want you to untie my hands and I'll get us both out of this.
There's no way.
I can't reach you.
- Move the chair over.
- That's not going to help for very long.
It might just do it.
Rover?
The ants.
Tell them to stop.
Can you?
Cavalry in computer form?
Don't knock it.
I'm not.
There you go.
Rover, I love you.
Call Steve Trevor at the IADC, and tell him what's happened here.
Tell him to see that the Easton plant is evacuated immediately.
I'm sure that's where they went.
There were ants in those things she was carrying.
She must intend to destroy the plant like she did those buildings.
What about you?
Are you gonna be okay?
I'll be all right.
I've got the cavalry on my side, remember?
We're ready to pump the mixture into the tanks at the loading dock.
Good.
Mr. Harcourt, the plant manager just got a call, sir... from the IADC, ordering us to evacuate the plant.
Probably just another crank call.
- No, sir.
He said Steve Trevor told him-
- It was just another crank call!
Yes, sir.
- All set.
- Good.
The few hundred ants you placed inside will muster a force of 10 million.
Why do you have to go in?
Can't you signal the ants from out here?
Destroying the building isn't enough.
I've got to neutralize the pesticides... that he's already manufactured.
If it spills, it'll poison everything within 10 miles.
Come on, Rover.
We've gotta save the plant.
Okay, little buddy, do your stuff.
Empty.
Do you think you can find those ants... and tell them to stop, like you did at the house?
All right.
You're sure?
I want you to hurry.
And be careful.
Hey, you!
Nobody's supposed to be in here!
Are you going to tell me... that you have not received orders to evacuate this building?
I will not be harassed into abandoning my endeavors by you... the IADC, or anyone else.
Harassed?
This whole building is about to come down, Mr. Harcourt.
Stop your operations and evacuate.
That sound!
Diana Prince has proof that the pesticide you're about to market is toxic.
Do you really want manslaughter on your conscience?
Have the people clear the building.
Come on!
- Is everyone out of the building?
- Somebody's in the control room!
Come on, you have to get out of here.
No!
The pesticide has to be neutralized!
Help me, please!
Help me!
Let me.
Two thousand!
The temperature of the mixture has to reach 2,000!
Come on!
We did it!
Come on.
No, it's too late.
We'll never get out.
Ever.
What happened?
I believe it's the cavalry, Dr. Janus.
Renie, you're safe.
And you're Renie again.
Sorry to disappoint you.
No, look...
I'm sorry for everything I did to you.
You had to become that creature for the things that I did.
I'm responsible for everything.
Save it for the judge, Doctor.
Maybe you'll get lucky.
Maybe the court will assign you a woman.
I'm the one who's responsible for this... and the buildings and for her.
I intend to face up to everything.
But do you think, after I do... that maybe you'll help me to start over?
This can make you forget... how you created Formicida, if that's what you want.
It certainly is.
You know, I can't figure out why that building is still standing.
I'll show you.
He talked the ants out of it?
Diana always said he has a way with words.
One two three four.
We're gonna make 'em shout "no more. "
Five, six, seven, eight.
We're gonna make 'em say we're great.
I can't believe it's fall girl.
Debbie I'm so proud of you.
When are you leaving?
Where are you going?
I'm so excited.
That's the problem.
What do you mean?
My parents don't want me to go.
They don't like the idea.
And if I go I have to raise the fare myself.
My Mother calls it outdoor burlesque.
Can you imagine?
Aww.
I know if I'd have won my parents would be all for it.
But you didn't won Lisa.
Yea.
Debbie what are you going to do?
Raise the money fast.
When do you have to leave Debbie?
But that's not enough time to raise the fare.
Well we'll just have to think of something I guess.
Music and chatter.
Hut, hut, Ray, call the play, call the play.
Go, go, go go go.
Alright.
Music and whistle.
Hustle up men.
Music and chatter.
Hi, how you been?
We should be on the road man.
I know.
What a day.
Chatter.
You know I don't think I'm be able to make it to Texas in just two weeks.
All talking at once.
I think we should all help her raise the money.
I've got a great idea.
Why don't we all work hard to raise money so we can go to Texas with her.
Yea, let's.
Debbie, we could boost your morale.
Gee, it would be wonderful if you could all be with me.
Next best thing to being Texas cowgirls ourselves.
Yahoo!
Well OK, but if we're all going to be there we've got to decide what we're going to do right now.
First of all we all have to get part time jobs after school for a week.
indistinct words.
Well I can get a job with Mr Bitterlich at the library.
I saw a help wanted sign in the record store.
Super, and I now Jimmy just gave up his job on the tennis courts.
There's no reason why they shouldn't give it to a girl.
Hey did anyone see the brownies washing cars this week end?
Yea, you want to wash cars?
Sure.
Maybe I could talk the Hardwicks into a job at the candle shop.
It's worth a try.
It's a start.
Maybe should advertise?
You mean like in the newspaper?
You know we should form a company, give ourselves a name.
Something simple and to the point.
Like Teen Services.
Yeah, that's us, Teen Services.
Yea.
The paper's where we should advertise.
We can advertise all the services we can do.
And all the services we can't do.
Of course we could draw posters and put them up all around town.
Print up cards too.
Remember we only have two weeks to raise the money, and that means no dates.
Well it's for a darn good cause, so I think the guys will understand.
What do you think?
They'll understand.
Well guys I don't think we should tell the guys right away.
Wait till we get it going, like in about, after the week end.
Good Idea Debbie.
Music playing.
I saw your sign in the window and I'm here to apply for the job.
You experienced?
Last summer I had a job at the flower shop.
Yea, so what happened?
Well the owner got a little fresh, so I quit.
well you're cute, you can't blame the guy for trying.
I might have been a little hasty.
But, I was younger then, and I need the money more now.
I think definitely we can work something out.
You mean I've got the job?
You bet.
When do I start?
The sooner the better.
How about later today?
Music
Oh Mr Greenfeld can I have a job, can I have a job please?
I have to go to Texas to be a Texas cowgirl, and we don't have any money.
You got the job, you got the job Debbie.
Do you really mean it?
Oh yes, yes I most certainly do.
So I realize how important this is, it's the chance of a lifetime, you know.
And I think we can arrange something around the store for a little extra money for you.
Well what did you have in mind?
Music
Oh come on now Mr Greenfeld
You could sort of help with things, you know, storing the stuff and then moving merchandise.
Oh sure Mr. Greenfeld, anything you say, but I've got to warn you that I'm pretty clumsy with boxes and stuff like that.
That's alright, the training, training sessions will be real easy.
Ha.
You know you can come in on a Sunday, I'll show you the storeroom and around the store, you know.
Oh Mr GreenfeldI really appreciate it.
Cause you know, I know that you really understand because I know that you're a football fan yourself.
Well I most certainly do, I most certainly do.
Oh thank you Mr Greenfeld, thank you so much.
OK, bye, bye.
Hi Roberta.
Oh hi Mr. Patrick.
Where you off to?
Oh, I'm going to cheerleeding practice.
Oh, well I'll walk you for a ways.
I'm going to the shop.
What are you up to these days?
We're looking for any kind of extra work, so that we can raise money for that trip to Texas.
We want to be with Debbie Benson for her first game when she cheers those Texas fellas.
Oh, sounds like a good idea.
Say, I'll tell you what.
You could earn some extra money by helping Mrs. Hardwick and I over at the candle shop, taking inventory.
Mr. Hardwick really?
When should I start?
You can start as soon as you like, how about tomorrow?
Oh Mr Hardwick, what could I ever do to repay you?
You'll think of something.
One, two, three, four,
We're going to make them say no more.
Five, six, seven, eight,
Oh, then giggling.
One, two, yea, hut 2.
My goodness Lisa, don't you ever wear underpants?
Oh, I just like to feel free.
It's nice to feel the clothes against your skin.
It's bad enough we have to wear them.
We should walk around like the way we came into this world, stark naked.
There goes that Lisa, talking about nature again.
Can you imagine if we all didn't wear underwear, we'd never get anything done.
Well I got something done, I got a job at Mr Greenfeld's sporting goods store.
And he promised to do anything he can to help me get to Texas.
Yea, I got Jimmy's old job.
Well I'm working at the library, but it's just two days a week.
Well I'm working for Mr Hardwick at the candle shop.
Me and Annie got a job working for Mr. Bradley, washing his car, but it's only for tomorrow.
Well let's just hope for the best, anyways right now we need to work on our cheers.
Yea, yea, let's go.
Hey Rick, Donna says the girls are pretty serious about this whole no dating thing, you know.
Well I don't understand why them raising money has to interfere with us for Christ's sakes.
Debbie says the bulk of their time will be in evenings, and especially on week ends.
They're mostly babysitters, hostess helpers, sales help, stuff like that.
Hey look, I don't like anyone interfering on my date nights.
Least of all my date herself.
Look, they think they can boost her morale if they go with her.
After all, she's so far away from home and all.
Hey man, it's not her morale that I am interested in boosting.
Haha, come on guys.
Hey look man, your girlfriend Debbie, she's the ringleader of the whole shceme.
Why don't you talk to her and tell her to think about us for a change.
Alright?
Alright, I'll give it a try.
Now come on, let's play ball.
Yea, let's go.
Come on.
Hut.
Go, go, go!
Indistinct chatter.
Indistinct chatter.
Rick says you all found jobs.
We had to.
He said it would be a big surprise.
Bye, have a good one tonight.
OK.
See you.
Bye, bye.
Hey, wait for me.
I wonder what they had in mind this time?
I don't know, but I'll bet it's terrific.
And wierd.
Fellas this is Roberta.
Oh Rick, waht are you doing here?
Oh my goodness!
We just thought we'd drop by and see how we could make out.
Laughter.
Oh, we're gonna make out?
What if Mrs. Eagle should come in.
Don't worry, we locked the door.
Haha.
Come here babe.
This is wierd huh?
Oh God yes.
Ooh, I like this.
Music
Music
Oh Mr. Greenfeld you're so strong.
Yes, that's the one.
Oh, let me help you.
No please, it's alright.
Here come on.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll bet.
Eight seventy five please.
What time is it Mr. Greenfeld?
It's 5:30 Debbie.
Oh, so that means I could go home now.
Yes, I, I uh, locked all the doors.
Mr. Greenfeld I've been working here three days and we still haven't worked on the stockroom, and I really need the extra money.
You know Debbie there are uh, there are other jobs that you can do,
I mean girls can do to make alot of money.
and they could be a little more fun.
Oh really, like what?
Well uh, you could do little favors for instance.
What kind of favors Mr. Greenfeld?
I was thinking, I mean it wouldn't hurt, I'll give you ten dollars...
- ...if you let me look at your tits.
- Mr. Greenfeld!
Please, please, I just want to look at your pretty little tits.
You know we're all good girls.
Oh I know that, I know that.
But I still want to look at your little tits, please.
Ten dollars, ten dollars.
Just, just for a look.
Ten dollars?
Money crinkling.
Well, alright.
Oh!
Mr. Greenfeld you promised!
I know.
Look, I'll give you another ten dollars.
Just let me touch them a little bit, please.
Just a little.
I don't know.
Oh please, please, here take it please.
Here ten more dollars
I just want to touch them a little bit, just touch them a little bit, just a little bit?
I think that's going a little too far Mr.
Oh, no, no, no, just a little touch, noone will know it, it's innocent really.
Really?
Just for a minute?
Oh just a minute, yea, yea, please.
Promise?
Well, OK.
Moans and groans.
You promised!
I'll give you another ten dollars.
Please, just let me suck them.
Just a little suck on each one.
Please?
OK?
Mr. Greenfield we are going a little bit too far.
I'll give you another ten dollars.
Please?
Well, would you give me twenty dollars for that?
I'll give you twenty dollars.
It's in my pocket.
Take it please.
Please, please come here.
I just want to suck them a little bit.
And then enough.
Uh Mr. Greenfeld, this is going a little too far.
It's a lot too far.
If you don't stop right this minute, I'm going to tell my mother.
Well girls, we're certtainly not earning enough money to do what we want to do.
Yea, and it's not as we're working hard enough for it.
Just avoiding Mr. Hardwick's hands in the shop is hard enough for me.
You too?
I don't know what Nick has in mind, but it certainly isn't selling records.
Every time I turn around on the tennis court thata Hamilton's there.
I don't know how many times I've bumped into him.
Yea, yea, certainly don't think Mr Bradley's got
Just car washing in mind for us this week end.
This sure isn't working out like we planned, huh girls?
No, no
Hey girls, come on, who died?
Come on, pep up, let's get our money together, and see what we've got?
We already know it's nowhere near enough.
Even if you brought in a bundle, we wouldn't have made enough for the week.
Well, count this.
Hey Debbie, goodness Debbie, that's about 30% of all we've raised.
Well what are you doing that we're not?
This.
My dear ladies.
Uh, Debbie what are you saying?
Well this is what they want.
You mean all you do is shake your tits and you make all that money?
No, not exactly, a little kissing and touching.
Who did the kissing and touching?
Well Mr. Greenfeld of course, he was desperate for it.
kept offering me money to go further, but I drew the line at a certain point.
I don't know Debbie.
How did you keep things from getting any further?
Yea, I can just see Mr. Hardwick when I tell him he can touch me, but not too much.
Listen girls, there's money to be had, fast money.
And we don't have to do anything more than we do with our boyfriends.
And they certainly have fun, don't they?
And we're all still virgins, aren't we?
Well most of us are.
What do you mean by that?
well I was just wondering, since I saw a certain someone's boyfriend going into going into the locker room, after we left.
Well it doesn't matter to us what she does with her boyfriend, to us she's still a virgin,
Anyway, she could probably give us some good advice.
Well listen, if we're really serious about this, then let's be honest with each other.
We all do things with our boyfriends, and we don't go all the way.
Exactly.
And there are men willing to pay for that on our terms.
But how do you keep it from getting out of hand?
First down, be firm on what you will do, and what you won't do.
Exactly, and now I think we should get down to business.
Before I go any further, does everyone agree with htis method of making extra money?
Sure, definite, yea sure
Tami?
I guess so, if everyone else says yes.
Alright, well now what about some techniques?
I don't know any techniques.
All laugh
Look, I know that each one of us has something special to offer, that we really don't mind doing.
Yea Annie, your boyfriend seems really happy, and I know you're still a virgin, so what's the secret?
I'll tell you, OK,
Who's got a banana?
I do.
All laugh.
Phone rings.
Phone rings.
Hello, hello.
Phone rings again.
Hello.
Oh, Tom.
You fuck, you know you're not supposed to call me on this phone.
It's a private line.
Giggles.
I know it, I know.
It's been a long time.
I miss you too.
The job is OK.
The Hardwicks are really nice.
I miss you too, baby.
Yea.
I'll meet you at dance class tomorrow.
Yea.
No, I promise Tom.
Dance class.
OK?
Yea.
Ok, Ok, I'll see you there tomorrow.
Bye.
Well, well, what have we here?
Oh, oh.
Is this what we're paying you for?
Oh Mrs. Hardwick.
Roberta no, no, no.
Roberta, it's fine Roberta.
Oh, don't worry Roberta.
I'm sorry.
I was only kidding.
Everything's fine Roberta.
Just sit down.
Oh, Mrs. Hardwick.
It's quite alright Roberta.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to take the time from work Mrs. Hardwick.
Now Roberta, it's quite alright.
Let's, let's sit and talk for a minute.
What, what do you want to talk about?
Our own things.
I mean your thing, and my thing.
and Mr. Hardwick's thing.
Everything's going to be just fine.
Mrs. Hardwick, what are you doing?
Well Roberta, we all have our own thing.
You have your candle, and
I like it when...
Pretty soon Mr. Hardwick's
When Mr. Hardwick is doing what?
Am I interrupting something?
Please let me interrupt anyway.
Oh, don't go away.
Mr. and Mrs. Hardwick!
Now, now Roberta.
Robarta, remember I talked about that uh, earning some extra money with a special job?
Mr. Hardwick.
Mrs. Hardwick.
I didn't know that's what you had in mind for the special job.
well, it'll earn you a lot of money.
It'll pay quite well.
All you have to do is watch.
That's right.
Take all his clothes off.
You understand.
Oh, Mr. Hardwick, you have a nice body.
Ah, thank you, so do you.
Let me see.
Don't be afraid, don't be shy.
Oh, it feels so good.
Doesn't it?
Is she wet?
Are you ready Roberta?
I think she's ready dear.
Good.
Oh, Mr. Hardwick.
Oh, oh, umm, oh.
We're gonna wash the car today.
We've got to try, we need the money.
Must be nobody home.
What are we going to do?
Knock, knock, knock.
Let's wash the car anyway.
We can't do that, he's not here.
I don't know.
Hey, cut it out.
Come on get to work.
You work on that side, I'll do the other side.
Oh, alright.
Yeah, let's get this car done quick, before Mr. Bradley gets home.
You think Mr. Bradley will go for it?
Well, Debbie said they all want it.
I know Mr. Bradley looks at you like that.
If Debbie can get forty for hers,
I can get a hundred for mine.
Well, at least between the two of us we ought to be able to.
OK.
I'm going to hose it down.
Alright, good.
I'll get out of the way.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, cut it out.
You're getting me all wet again.
Aww.
Ah, no, stop.
Come on.
Why are you girls washing the car in the rain?
Oh, what's wrong?
Well, we're waiting for the sun to come out.
Listen you girls better get inside and dry off, huh?
OK, we're going to change our clothes.
Thanks, it's right here.
Yeah, well uh, I think you ought to, uh,
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
Oh, excuse me Mr. Bradley.
Uh, no it's alright.
Why don't you go in there and change.
I think you're really soaking, soaking wet.
Well why don't you girls go upstairs and change before you get pneumonia.
You sure there isn't anything else we could do for you Mr. Bradley?
Yes there is, but I uh, don't think you'd understand.
You'd be surprised at what we understand.
Mr. Bradley we're not just washing cars anymore.
Well I really don't think you'd be into what I have in mind.
You'd be surprised at what we're into Mr. Bradley.
You're serious, aren't you?
Oh yes.
Oh, very serious.
How can I be sure you aren't going to tell anybody?
We wouldn't tell anybody Mr Bradley.
Would we Annie?
This is between you and us.
If I ask you to undress, how much would it cost me?
Mmm, ten dollars.
We've never done anything like this before Mr. Bradley.
You're our very first customer.
How's that Mr. Bradley?
Is that what you wanted?
Yes, it's uh, beautiful.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Is there anything else we can do for you Mr. Bradley?
I'll give you $25 if you let me kiss you all over.
Yeah, that'd be fine Mr. Bradley.
I, I mean really all over.
That's OK.
Mmm, you're so nice and wet.
Mnn, I don't believe this.
Do you know how long I've waited?
For you.
Mmm, this feels so good.
Oh, you don't know what you're doing to me.
You're driving me crazy.
Oh, you're so wet.
Oh my God, I think I hear my wife coming.
Hey Donna, wait up.
How about seeing me later.
You know we haven't seen each other for almost a week.
I really can't tonight.
I have to work here til 5.
And then I have a babysitting job.
Donna, this is really getting crazy.
I don't even get a chance to speak to you anymore.
Call me later on tonight.
Good afternoon Mr. Biddle.
Well hello Donna, how are you today?
Fine sir.
Lovely day isn't it Donna?
Yes it is Mr. Biddle.
Donna, I understand you girls have formed a company.
How's it coming along?
Oh, everyone's coming fine.
Do you think you will be able to raise the amount of money you need?
I certainly hope so.
We've added on a few new services, you know?
Oh, what are they?
This isn't exactly the place for details.
But I can tell you that there's something for everybody.
And everybody likes something.
Well, sounds intriguing.
You must keep me informed.
Donna I have to go to the office now.
Would you mind keeping an eye on things here?
Yes sir.
Thank you very much.
Huh!
Tim!
Mr. Biddle's coming right back.
You're not supposed to be here.
Even if I'm so desperate for you
I could jump off a bridge?
Especially not in that condition.
Oh come on baby.
It feels like weeks since I've seen you.
I'm going nuts.
Mr. Biddle's coming right back.
You know we don't have any time.
Come on Donna,you gotta do something.
Look at me.
You need something?
This isn't the place.
Baby you got to do something.
We've got the time.
Ok, ok.
You want me to show you what my girlfriends showed me?
Sure.
Anything.
Oh baby you're beautiful.
What have you and your friends been doing, babe?
Oh, wait and see.
God, this is a dream come true.
I missed 4 passes yesterday.
I couldn't take it.
Oh baby.
You're wonderful.
Oh baby.
What in the world?
Tim!
I want you to leave immediately.
Get out of here this minute.
Come back here.
Come back here.
You report to me in my office first thing in the morning.
Young lady, this is outrageous.
You come with me to my office.
Right now.
Yes Mr. Biddle.
Please Mr. Biddle.
Just don't tell my parents.
Please.
Please Mr. Biddle, please, please dont' tell my parents.
I beg you please don't tell them.
They'll kill me.
I am really surprised at you Donna.
You know the rules here.
How could you so wantonly break them?
I'm sorry Mr. Biddle.
I didn't mean to break the rules.
I swear to God I'll never do it again.
Just don't, don't tell my parents.
Your parents should know, they're the ones to deal with this.
Alright stop crying.
Stop crying, I won't tell your parents.
I won't tell your parents.
What you need young lady is a good spanking.
Oh!
I don't care, just don't tell my parents.
And I'm just the one to give it to you.
Come over here.
Don't hurt me. please don't hurt me.
Ow!
Now just what is all this about this company you girls have formed?
Please Mr. Biddle.
What kind of services are you providing?
Please just stop Mr. Biddle.
You girls.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Ow.
Whaa, I'll do anything you ask.
Anything.
What do you mean anything?
Well, well, what would you like?
What would I like?
Try anything you like.
Just please don't tell my parents.
Do you mean it, anything?
Yes Mr. Biddle, anything.
Well.
Are you sure?
Yes Mr. Biddle
What I've always wanted to do is pull off your skirt and take down your pants.
Spank your bare bottom.
That's OK Mr. Biddle.
You serious?
Yes Mr. Biddle.
You alright?
Yes Mr. Biddle.
Whatever you say.
Will that cost me very much?
I'll leave that entirely up to you.
Please, please.
Well alright.
Just don't hurt me Mr. Biddle.
Please.
Ow.
Oh.
OOh!
Ow, ow, ow.
Just don't hurt me Mr. Biddle.
It's really not a bad idea, this company you girls have formed.
Are we in trouble?
What'd he say?
Don't worry about it.
I talked to him and everything's OK.
Really?
Yeah, he's really an alright guy.
Well just don't worry about it.
Be glad.
Hey, You know, I guess I just don't know human nature.
What can I say?
She wears no underwear you say?
Yep.
She's sixteen.
Pretty, and she'll definitely bud.
Isn't that sort of dangerous?
Don't worry about it Ashley.
We'll work around it.
It's gonna cost you though Ash.
Well, I don't know.
Oh, here she comes right now.
You can see for yourself.
Here are the towels you wanted.
Um, should I quit for the day?
Um one more thing Lisa.
Thank you very much.
Would you get me that clipboard over there by the phone?
Sure thing.
Uh, here's your clipboard Hamilton.
Thanks Lisa.
Can I leave now?
Uh, no.
Wait, first I'd like you to meet my friend Ashley.
Ashley, Lisa
And the services you perform.
Hi Lisa.
I was telling Ashley about you and your friends.
Yea, tell me is there anything you girls don't do?
Oh well you know we're good girls, and I think you know what I mean by that.
But you know, whatever we can't give you, we make up in enthusiasm.
Sounds good.
Uh Lisa, Ashley and I will be finished with this game in just a few minutes.
Would you bring us a few fresh towels and meet us in the locker room?
Sure thing guys.
Catch you later.
You're going to have one hell of a night tonight Ashley.
Yea.
Yea, what do you say, let's head for the showers, huh?
I tell you, these babes are really something.
You got to see them.
Sixteen years old.
Built like this.
Sounds good.
Oh my God.
Go ahead, stare honey.
You'll have the time of your life.
Oh Debbie.
I've been craving you, oh.
You know we can't go on like this, it's killing me.
I mean can't we do something more?
But Mr Greenfeld we girls promised ourselves that that we wouldn't spoil ourselves for our future husbands.
You know that, but there are other things you can do that won't spoil you.
Well I guess the other girls are more experienced in matters like that.
Well, yea, yea look, I don't want the other girls.
I want you.
Look, I'll make you a deal.
OK?
I'll put up all the money for your trip to Texas.
Ok?
I'll also pay for your other girlfriend's hotel expenses
If they don't have the money in two weeks.
OK?
But, what am I gonna have to do?
Well, we'll work something out.
It wel,I it'll be a surprise.
Hello.
Oh, hi Deb, how you been?
Oh, you don't need me.
Yea, I did it yesterday.
It was a cinch, you know?
Real fun, you ought to enjoy it.
Oh, come on.
You know, don't be scared, it's OK.
It really is easy, gosh.
But you know it'll cost for me too?
Do you really think so?
If you're sure.
Anything for the old cause
Catch you later, OK?
Bye bye.
How you girls doing today?
The other girls are doing fine.
What about you?
I seem to be trailing behind.
And why is that?
I guess I just need more time.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Hi Lisa.
Yo, Tami and I are both in your teen services company, and she tells me that your interested in what we have to offer.
What do you have to offer?
Oh, anything.
You mean you'll do anything I like?
Not anything.
Oh, but I'm sure we can work it out.
Oh definitely we can work it out.
Tami, go lock up.
Alright.
You mean I can have anything?
Almost.
What'll it cost me?
Oh, we'll leave that up to you.
Mr Greenfeld.
I'm here, dressed as you wanted me.
Debbie, this is Mr. Greenfeld.
Please lock the doors and come up to the Mezzanine level.
Uh huh.
Mr. Greenfeld?
Mr. Greenfeld?
Mr. Greenfeld?
Mr. Greenfeld, where are you?
Debbie.
Mr. Greenfeld!
Yep, it is.
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Arrgh, Debbie.
Debbie.
Mr. Greenfeld.
Debbie.
Mr. Greenview.
Debbie, ha, ha.
Oh, ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be captain of the football team.
But I was too small.
But I had one thing that was big enough.
My Mr. Greenfield, how big you are.
I've always dreamed of being a quarterback.
And making love to the captain of the cheerleaders.
Drink slowly
Your name?
Your name?
The Rover
What an interesting name
Yours?
The Homeless
We're the same
Where are you off to?
Anywhere there's a road
It's a dead end
There's only desert ahead
I know, but where there's a will there's a way
That's true
If I were you and if I had a choice
I wouldn't be in this God forsaken place
By your looks you must have gone without food for a few days
At least 3 to 4 days
Wait, I'll get you something to eat
Wait
The water is poisoned, don't drink if you want to live
I am returning the water and the food ...intact to you
Have you come to arrest me?
No
By your looks... you don't look like a travelling business man
Then...friend
Have I crossed you in any way in the past?
You are too much; repaying kindness with a grudge leaving me a damn horse
Do you want to kill me?
You are a rogue you should appreciate that if it weren't for me you'd have been a pile of bones by now
Put out the fire
Why?
I can't stand the light
You have to be patient then
I'll tell you a story
I was born in the night
My family lit all the lamps to welcome me
Since then I've always liked the light and I would cry at night if there was no light
That sort of disturbed the whole family
Put it out
What great skills!
You flatter me
That's all I know
If this goes on I'll make a fool of myself
Friend, fate has brought us together ...in this barren land
We don't have a rapport and there's nothing to talk about
Ride your horse and get out of here
You're too cold
It's dark
I can't even find the directions, how can I leave?
That's your business
Why bear such a grudge?
Can you bear with me for a night and let me sleep with this small fire going?
I'll leave the first thing in the morning, okay?
Who's he?
Why doesn't he give his name?
Great, it must be the camel caravan
Wait
What's the matter?
No
Friend, if you don't want fresh blood to stain your clothes... it's not too late to leave even now
Blood?
Whose blood?
Chik Ming Sing, come out and face your death
There's also that accomplice
Accomplice?
If you're really Chik Ming Sing that accomplice should be me
I am Chik Ming Sing
So you're running from your enemies
Don't worry, I'll attend to your corpse
I promise I'll get the best coffin for you
Tell me your address so I could send you back
This technique is called the Bastard's Somersault
Damn you
Brother, let me live, okay?
That means killing myself
Is this how you handle the hammer?
Not like this
Bastard, why did you hit me there?
That's our favourite spot
Are you giving up?
Not unless you come to apologise to godfather with me
I can't do that
Yau Kwoon Hung, we've been brothers for years
Don't force me to kill you
Bull shit.
You can't kill me
Godfather said regardless of if you're dead or alive as long as you return
The second and third batch just follow closely
It's useless if you get help
You must be Wang Tao Sang the Soaring Eagle
Your father
Damn you
Why do you like to hit this spot?
This is the iron egg smashing into the soft egg
It's completely changed
Why did you kill him?
He attacked first, it was self defence
The issue is you're so alone that I should save you
I got you this plaque
What a busy body
It's difficult to do the right thing
You have a murderous look you must have killed many people
I don't remember
I do remember how many women I've had
The 3 men you killed just now are...
Two, one was killed by you
Tell me frankly.
For which case are you arresting me for?
So you take me for one of those man hunters?
Sorry, I'm not interested in such an immoral profession
Then why are you following me?
What do you want?
Don't doubt my identity anymore
I am a vagabond
If you want me as friend, that's good ...if not, forget it
It doesn't hurt in your case to make one more friend
Alright...
I'll take you as friend temporarily
As you wish
Your background is a mystery
There's an end to conversation and there's a time for riddles to be solved, right?
Yes, please
Why does the Iron Boat gang want to kill you?
You want to listen to this story too?
I've nothing else better to do, if you talk I'll listen
The Iron Boat gang is a criminal gang and does a lot of illegal activities
The head is Yoh Xi Hung
He is also the godfather of the Thirteen Eagles
He is cruel, merciless and cold
He brought up the Thirteen Eagles as killing machines
Feelings' is not a word in his dictionary
If one member shows slight affection for another they'll be beaten up
How Yoh Xi Hung thinks and feels is how the Thirteen Eagles think and feel
Absolute obedience is necessary
I am an orphan and was sold to the gang at seven
I did all the bad things imaginable and became numb to cruelty
I can't remember how many children there were... at the start
Over ten years, the coward, the disobedient those who didn't progress in kung fu, the kind hearted ...have all been killed
Only 13 people are left
Thirteen Eagles?
Thirteen Eagles
There are only 9 of them left now
Yes...the story you made up is interesting
If you really did all those bad things all your life only to end up being persecuted by Yoh Xi Hung don't you find it ironical?
I feel you had no reason to rebel against Yoh Xi Hung
I was tired of killing
I don't believe you
You said the Thirteen Eagles were trained to be killing machines just like extensions of his sword
It's strange.
Do killing weapons have thoughts which spur them to rebel?
Weapons won't rebel but he forgot one point
I am still a human being
You appear like a man but more like a rogue
You...
Naturally you don't believe I became tired of killing
I had a strong reason for rebelling against him
One day Yoh Xi Hung assembled the Thirteen Eagles ...in the Jui Yi Hall for a conference
We hurried there
Children
Yes
Godfather, we wish you health and good fortune
Good, I just received information that the 32 security bureaus in the central area will jointly guard a cargo of royal treasures which include the invaluable red sea ginseng
In few days the treasure reaches deserted Yu Fai town
Do you now understand why I have called this meeting?
Yes
Godfather, nothing is impossible in fulfilling your wish
Right, heaven and earth can't stand in our way
You're right
Sooner or later we'll be great so we have to expand our territory
There should not be any lack of money
What I worry about is... the 32 security bureaus will bring along a lot of men
And I've heard the leader is Golden Spear Tao De Biu
Godfather, you should have confidence in us
All of us have been to many battles
Have we ever failed you?
That's what I want to hear
Good, lads, await my orders to set off
Robbers, get up
Robbers
Quick...
The Thirteen Eagles of Iron Boat gang
What, the old thief Yoh Xi Hung has come too?
It's below his lordship to fight dummies
Leave him to me, you go and chase those robbers
Chase them
Yes
Go
Quick...
let's go
Go on, don't worry about me
Go quickly
Chik
Don't worry about me
Catch it...
Chase them quickly
Aunt, teach us how to write, okay?
Okay
What is this character?
Sky
Write one more time, aunt
What is this character?
Jiang, isn't that your name?
Yes, so is yours
Yes
I write it for you to see
That's right
You can't come out, go and lie down
I'll get my family
Brother...he's awake
He's up?
That's good, let's go and see
Mom
Come here
Mom
I already said he's strong and will wake up
Don't get up, lie down...
Lie down first
Yes, lie for a while, don't get up
You've been unconscious for 3 days and nights
I found you on my way home in the woods
I am indebted to you for saving my life
Don't mention it
How were you wounded?
I was ambushed by my enemy and was wounded
Luckily I escaped quickly, otherwise...
Your name please?
Cheung Gia Ran
And you?
Jiang Shun Kwai
Brother Jiang
This is my mother
Aunty
My wife
Madam
My sister Siu Fung
Miss Fung
Brother feel free to make yourself at home
Good...
Recuperate well
It's late, what are you thinking?
I thought about it thoroughly
I was too strong willed and succumbed to my temper
My actions were tainted by some evil elements
What I've seen these two months are kind, friendly faces
I have been listening to ways to live in harmony
As I grew up
I had not enjoyed family life
I will always cherish this
Miss Fung, do you believe I have killed people?
Yes, I do
How come?
If you didn't kill others... why would they come and kill you?
Don't you find me frightening?
No, I believe you'll never kill again
Miss Fung, do you want to know what I was like?
What matters is from now on you know how to lead a good life
Lead a good life?
Yes
You must remember that how to lead a good life
Godfather
What's the matter?
Your day of vengeance has come
Yien Lin
Yes
You've found him?
Yes
Wan Da has already found where Wang An is hiding
He's in the South Village near Tai Ran
Wang An
I thought I could not find you
You had me captivated such that I suffered for 2 years now I have a chance to take revenge
Godfather we will depart right now and bring Wang An to you
We are going now
Good, it doesn't matter if he's dead or alive
Godfather...
Chik Ming Sing is back
Chik...
Chik
Godfather
Chik
Godfather I'm back
It's good you've returned
I can relax now
Yien Lin couldn't find you so I thought you have been caught by the authorities
How could that be?
You taught me I should not endanger my colleagues
I'd rather be killed than be taken alive
Chik, I swore as long as you haven't come back
I'll not touch the loot lt'll always be in the vault
Thank you for your kind love
Lost it?
No
Then why haven't you brought it back with you?
Godfather
I said... these 13 silver plaques have been made by my own hands
It symbolizes your life and the whole Iron Boat gang
Godfather
It represents me too yet you could forget
I dare not
Dare not?
You have deliberately disobeyed me
Godfather, you...
Godfather, I know I'm wrong
Godfather
Forget it
Chik
Yes
Let me ask you
Of the four Jiang Nan man hunters I often talk about how many have been killed?
Three
Who's left?
Devil's Plight Wang An
This time you'll really see the devil
Wang An's kung fu is not bad
Failure is not an option
Kill him and let godfather be happy
Big brother, when this is finished
I want to see a friend
Can I return a few days later?
A woman?
Chik has fallen in love with a woman
Big brother, Wang An is hiding in this valley
We must have got it wrong
There is only a family in this valley and there are no other roads
What are we doing there?
We're not wrong at all
I passed here last month and saw Wang An come out of this house
I was alone so I stayed away from him
Big brother, stop
You must be wrong
You are wrong
Wang An, come out
Come here, quick
Follow mother inside
Wait
Please don't kill the wrong person
He isn't Wang An, he saved my life
His name is Jiang Shun Kwai
What would you know?
You haven't seen him
I've seen him, he's Wang An
That's right
Would you really assist him and kill my brother?
So she is the woman you have fallen in love with
Not bad
Chik Ming Sing, tell her the purpose of your trip here
Big brother, you're pushing him
How can he say it... in front of his lover?
Let's finish the job
Stop fighting
Big brother, listen to me
What are you doing?
Listen to me
Chik
Mother...
Dear
Brother Jiang
Get lost
Brother
Chik, you're nuts
Big brother, why must we kill everyone?
I beg you, let her go
Big brother
Godfather said we should leave no one alive
You heard that yourself, dare you disobey?
Miss Fung
Didn't you chop off Wang An's head?
I couldn't bear to do it
You dare talk of feelings
I taught you this?
Did I teach you to feel?
Godfather, listen
Don't forget a minor punishment is 72 flogs, a major one is 36
You didn't only see me punish people once so it is obvious you deliberately rebel against me
I dare not, forgive me
I can do that but you must knock them down one by one otherwise you'll be punished
Godfather
Attack
Brothers, you...
Wait
Yes
I was wrong
You admit you're wrong?
I don't think you mean it
I am truly wrong
Let no more be said, torture him
I see
Since then you became tired of killing right?
Yes
From the start of this incident to the end of the other matter
I made up my mind to leave Yoh Xi Hung
I don't think so
The reason why you don't kill is you have fallen in love with Miss Siu Fung
Were it somebody else who is not emotionally involved with you ...it might not have changed your ways
Right, further up is the desert
Why don't you turn back?
There's no hurry
Your pursuers will soon catch up with you
Look
Looks like he's been dead for a few days
Damn, it must be the work of Chik Ming Sing
Chase
Friend, listen to my advice and turn back
You cannot run forever
See?
They are hot on our heels
As I suggested shall we divert their strength?
Would that not make me owe you more?
Let's go
Chik Ming Sing, you're cruel
You won't show mercy even to your brothers
When have you shown mercy to me?
I have made efforts to find this plot of land to be your burial ground, satisfied?
Lure him into the woods
Chik Ming Sing, godfather says you're smart but you've fallen into our trap this time
Your three-sectioned stick is useless in the woods
Don't worry, I won't kill you now
I'll take you back alive to face godfather
You're dreaming
Wait
I'll show you something
Double Sword in Sleeve
These two are difficult to deal with
What weapon did you use to kill them?
It's not on them?
Axe
Axe?
I asked too much
Rising up from the Heavenly-Mountain
The moon lay over the clouded ocean
And the wind that has come a thousand miles, beats at the Jade Gate battlements...
China marches its men down Baideng Road, while
Tartar troops peer across blue waters of the bay...
And since not one battle famous in history, sent all its fighters back again,
The soldiers turn round looking toward the border, eyes and think of home with wistful
And of those tonight in the upper chambers, who toss and sigh and cannot rest.
Friend, why do you suddenly have a heavy heart?
Have you changed?
This poem is Li Po's Kwan Shan Yue
It represents some peoples' sentiments meaning one could not return to one's home
I am even worse
I have no home at all
I knew you are no ordinary man and you carry a lot of hate, right?
Right
I am full of hate
I am looking for an arch villain
What an irony, I am escaping from my enemies and you're searching for your enemy
Are you joking with me?
Do I look like I'm joking?
Can I help?
No
Your future looks bleak
Chik, if you really kill Yoh Xi Hung, are you... going to restructure the gang becomebossyourself?
Are you going to recruit some killers under you?
No such interest
I will search all over for someone
Search for someone?
I have sworn that if I die...
I hope I will die at his hands because I owe him a blood debt
Who is this?
Se Ma Sun's son-in-law Cheuk Yi Fan
Have you heard of him?
No
What does he do?
Se Ma Sun is a prodigy of the martial arts world and opposes all villains
Once he thwarted Yoh Xi Hung's plans to rob official salaries at sea and created a hatred between them
So Yoh Xi Hung used the most cruel way to take revenge
Father
Master...
Father
Mercy
What?
Getting soft?
Father...
Master
Mother...sister
You...
Yoh Xi Hung, don't think you've succeeded
I curse you for killing my family you'll die an even meaner death
As long as I don't die by your hands that's fine
You'd better save your strength to report in hell
Father...
Se Ma Sun's daughter Se Ma Yu Chin is the wife of Cheuk Yi Fan, Double Sword Sleeve
This last is for you
Father
I am looking for an escape just let me give birth to the child then die
Good
Since we can't kill Cheuk Yi Fan as he's not here just as well he kill his off spring
Chik, I let you kill her
Godfather, she is a pregnant woman
You've really changed?
Chik, you used to be the first to kill and rob yet tonight you won't kill even one person
I know
You still hate me for killing Wang An, right?
No
Then let's do it
Are you killing or not?
Yes
My husband will avenge me
You can't kill a pregnant woman
Sir, you can't kill me
No explanation will do
Just brace yourself it'll be over soon
Kill
You killed her?
I made a decision at that moment
I could not die then
No one on Se Ma Sun's family wanted to die so I had to live on to kill Yoh Xi Hung
Can you do it alone?
I know it's almost impossible but I must succeed
Don't forget, at his side are always
Lin Gin Ming and Fan Lun
Let's go further we'll meet Vulture Yien Lin, Blue Eagle Wan Da
The Owl Shou Kao Shing
I've heard that among the Thirteen Eagles
Vulture Yien Lin has the best kung fu
The second one is Blue Eagle Wan Da and the third is you Black Eagle Chik Ming Sing
You're well informed on the Iron Boat gang's background
You'll have a hard time fighting them alone if you don't have a partner like me you will die
Friend, we're not related in any way
You've already helped me twice
Not for fame or money so why did you do it?
Not for anything, it doesn't matter
Then can you tell me your name?
Those words again, homeless...
That's enough...
Damn, what rotten luck
The first batch has gone for half a month the second batch has gone for ten days
Why is there no news of them?
Right
Chik doesn't have guts to travel by sea
This is entire dominated by us
We have reconnaissance in the city
Then there are those officials who are dying to capture him
That's why we have concluded he must have gone into the desert
But...
Big brother, there is no way that Chik could ...handle a few people by himself
Don't underestimate him
His kung fu is good and he is smart
Godfather picked him because of these attributes
But he misjudged him not realising he would be a rebel
I don't respect Chik
Alright...stop arguing
Ten miles from here is a small town
Pass that is the barren desert
Tomorrow we'll check it out
Sir
Boss...we have customers
At last
Please, sir
Will this be enough to buy your inn?
I can't sell it, it's my business
How can you do this?
Can you outrun a rabbit?
Sir, naturally the rabbit will run faster
Is your head harder than the table?
Sir, what exactly do you want?
I want you to get out of here right now
Yes
Get lost quicker than a rabbit
Yes
Or I'll smash your head
Wait
Don't forget the silver on the table
You can use it for lodgings and food
Come back after a month
Yes
There'll be a couple of corpses here by then
There'll be a couple of corpses here?
Please bury them
Yes
Let's go
Wait
Leave your clothes
My clothes?
Sir, I...
Strip
Yes
So you want to dress up as a waiter?
Yes
This is the last inn before the desert unless they don't come after you if they do they must rest here
But they won't be easily deceived
You're wrong, the smarter one is, the easier one will be deceived because they think they're smart
Are you still around?
Get lost
Yes, let's go
We must get rid of one of them first
I agree
Waiter, prepare food
Great...gentlemen...here's business
Gentlemen...have a seat
It's rare to have customers at our place
This is for taking the dust off you this is for soothing your weariness
this is for quenching your thirst
Waiter, ask your boss to come out
I am the owner and the waiter
I take care of the whole place here
Just tell me what you need
Then prepare a month's ration for the three of us
Yes...
Come back
Have you seen two groups of people, seven altogether pass by here towards the desert?
Let me think
Ah, I've got it...
There was a one-eyed gentlemen who was very generous with his money
The bone is crushed
I ask you again, have you seen someone aged about twenty seven, dressed in black with a three-sectioned stick pass here?
I can't speak, please let go first
Speak up
Yes...
The batch last time also asked about this person
I told them but they wouldn't believe me and headed towards the desert to look for him
What didn't they believe?
The fact that, that person in black was... helping me with the dishes and other chores upstairs
They didn't believe me impossible.
Would Chik work here?
Right, he can't bear such tasks
What does he look like?
Ordinary looking, under thirty dressed in black
Don't let his huge appearance deceive you he is lazy and eats a lot;
not a good thing
Right, also his leg seems to have some problem
Let me see...ah yes, it's his left leg
He walks like this, see?
He's walking with a limp
He seems to have a huge problem with his leg
Enough
Old Six
Yes
Follow him and have a look
Yes
Gentlemen may I go now?
Go on
I'll go and prepare food and wine
I'll be right with you
Please
Please
Please
Get up
Get up...
Cao Gao Shing
It's you
One down
It won't be easy to deal with Yien Lin and Wan Da
What about an ambush?
It's risky
We must kill one with only one strike otherwise...
Let's do it then
Stay up here, I'll go down
Be alert
Be careful of Yien Lin's Lethal Ring and his head, which can crush a rock
Here's food and wine
That gentleman said the kid in the kitchen is not the person you're looking for
He's gone to the toilet with stomach trouble
That's good, he'll eat more
We have a house rule the first pot of wine is for travellers from afar
It's free
Cheers
Waiter, where's the toilet?
In the alley behind the kitchen
Old Two, go and take a look
The back of the kitchen
Not a bad knife, right?
How much has Chik Ming Sing paid to hire you?
Can I be bought?
Then who are you?
Killer of pigs
Old Two
Don't waste your breath, he can't answer you nor can he help you
Chik, even if someone helped you to kill me you can't escape Godfather
I don't want to run anymore, I'll go and see him
Friend, in such circumstances you should not speak too much, or you'll get soft and can't bear to kill
Do you want to know who I am?
You are...
I'll say it only once, listen carefully
I am Cheuk Yi Fan
Chik
A bunch of nincompoops
No news up to now
In a few days we'll go to Iron Boat gang
You are aware Yoh Xi Hung's kung fu is not easy to deal with
He also has two loyal followers
Grey Eagle and Yellow Eagle
It's not an even match you should...
I should flee to escape death, right?
Yes
Aren't you afraid to die?
Die?
Everyone is afraid to die the question is what is one dying for?
I did too many bad deeds and I hope I could atone for my sins with my life
If I could live, all the better but if I die, I die in peace
You have helped me a lot and you have saved my life
I should involve you in this
Chik Ming Sing, I haven't helped you in vain
I may be an enemy
What do you mean?
Don't get me wrong
I am just saying there is no certainty in this world
I was just stating a universal truism
Maybe your enemy is my enemy and you have done me a favour
We have a complicated relationship
It's actually quite simple
We're getting more intimate
We need each other
Your enemy is Yoh Xi Hung mine is the Iron Boat gang
You have a grudge against them?
Everyone wants to kill outlaws not necessarily because of vengeance
Excluding you
Unless you team up with you there is no better way
Chik Ming Sing is back...
Chik Ming Sing, you dare come back...
Traitor
I guessed right, Chik will always be Chik
You've killed Yien Lin
Why haven't you fled?
Why return to die?
If I don't kill you I won't have peace
This person must have come to accompany you to die
Wrong, I've come to dig your grave
Let's see about that
Double Sword in Sleeve Cheuk Yi Fan
Correct
Chik, so much for good judgement you've found an enemy to help you
You'll die for sure
So it's really you
Why didn't you kill me on the road to avenge your wife?
I want to find the truth about the death of Se Ma Sun's family
But I have said earlier, our grudge should not have lasted till now
because we should join hands and kill our common enemy Yoh Xi Hung
Alright then
Yoh Xi Hung, you've always eradicated your enemy but you left me alive
That means your time has come
Although you two have joined forces you might not gain the upper hand
Chik, death or alive is before you
Listen to me
Help me get rid of Cheuk Yi Fan and I'll forget the past
Cheuk Yi Fan, you want to use him to get rid of me then kill him afterwards
Chik, you've been tricked
You should know that getting rid of me isn't that easy
You tried your best but you'll die ultimately
I will persist to avenge my wife
Chik, you'd better help me get rid of him
I don't think your three-sectioned stick is a match for 'Double Sword in Sleeve'
Let's join forces
Don't be tricked by him
Would you forget I killed the twelve Eagles?
They're all dead, what's the big deal?
Besides, you didn't kill them all by yourself
I have no children and the gang's... entire wealth will be bequeathed to you one day
Chik Ming Sing, you must understand;
If we fight, he'll be the winner
But there is nothing to support your promise
You've been with me since you were young when have I gone back on my word ...and lied to you?
Godfather, you must stand by your words
Stand by your words
Cheuk Yi Fan, he killed your pregnant wife
If you want to take revenge...please
Dog
Your loved ones have all died because of you
Friend, I can't change my ways besides, I'd rather stay alive than have a good death
Chik, what are you waiting for?
Do it, quick
Yoh Xi Hung, your cruelty over these twenty years ...have been wasted
So it's easy to raise someone... but difficult to control his heart
I have at last understood this and am able to discern right and wrong
Cheuk Yi Fan, take your revenge
Your wife's murderer is still alive
My enemies are all dead
I swore I'll die by your sword
If you don't kill me... your wife would not rest in peace
Drink slowly
Your name?
Your name?
The Rover
What an interesting name
Yours?
The Homeless
We're the same
Where are you off to?
Anywhere there's a road
It's a dead end
There's only desert ahead
I know, but where there's a will there's a way
That's true
If I were you and if I had a choice
I wouldn't be in this God forsaken place
By your looks you must have gone without food for a few days
At least 3 to 4 days
Wait, I'll get you something to eat
Wait
The water is poisoned, don't drink if you want to live
I am returning the water and the food ...intact to you
Have you come to arrest me?
No
By your looks... you don't look like a travelling business man
Then...friend
Have I crossed you in any way in the past?
You are too much; repaying kindness with a grudge
leaving me a damn horse
Do you want to kill me?
You are a rogue you should appreciate that if it weren't for me you'd have been a pile of bones by now
Put out the fire
Why?
I can't stand the light
You have to be patient then
I'll tell you a story
I was born in the night
My family lit all the lamps to welcome me
Since then I've always liked the light and I would cry at night if there was no light
That sort of disturbed the whole family
Put it out
What great skills!
You flatter me
That's all I know
If this goes on I'll make a fool of myself
Friend, fate has brought us together ...in this barren land
We don't have a rapport and there's nothing to talk about
Ride your horse and get out of here
You're too cold
It's dark
I can't even find the directions, how can I leave?
That's your business
Why bear such a grudge?
Can you bear with me for a night and let me sleep with this small fire going?
I'll leave the first thing in the morning, okay?
Who's he?
Why doesn't he give his name?
Great, it must be the camel caravan
Wait
What's the matter?
No
Friend, if you don't want fresh blood to stain your clothes... it's not too late to leave even now
Blood?
Whose blood?
Chik Ming Sing, come out and face your death
There's also that accomplice
Accomplice?
If you're really Chik Ming Sing that accomplice should be me
I am Chik Ming Sing
So you're running from your enemies
Don't worry, I'll attend to your corpse
I promise I'll get the best coffin for you
Tell me your address so I could send you back
This technique is called the Bastard's Somersault
Damn you
Brother, let me live, okay?
That means killing myself
Is this how you handle the hammer?
Not like this
Bastard, why did you hit me there?
That's our favourite spot
Are you giving up?
Not unless you come to apologise to godfather with me
I can't do that
Yau Kwoon Hung, we've been brothers for years
Don't force me to kill you
Bull shit.
You can't kill me
Godfather said regardless of if you're dead or alive as long as you return
The second and third batch just follow closely
It's useless if you get help
You must be Wang Tao Sang the Soaring Eagle
Your father
Damn you
Why do you like to hit this spot?
This is the iron egg smashing into the soft egg
It's completely changed
Why did you kill him?
He attacked first, it was self defence
The issue is you're so alone that I should save you
I got you this plaque
What a busy body
It's difficult to do the right thing
You have a murderous look you must have killed many people
I don't remember
I do remember how many women I've had
The 3 men you killed just now are...
Two, one was killed by you
Tell me frankly.
For which case are you arresting me for?
So you take me for one of those man hunters?
Sorry, I'm not interested in such an immoral profession
Then why are you following me?
What do you want?
Don't doubt my identity anymore
I am a vagabond
If you want me as friend, that's good ...if not, forget it
It doesn't hurt in your case to make one more friend
Alright...
I'll take you as friend temporarily
As you wish
Your background is a mystery
There's an end to conversation and there's a time for riddles to be solved, right?
Yes, please
Why does the lron Boat gang want to kill you?
You want to listen to this story too?
I've nothing else better to do, if you talk I'll listen
The Iron Boat gang is a criminal gang and does a lot of illegal activities
The head is Yoh Xi Hung
He is also the godfather of the Thirteen Eagles
He is cruel, merciless and cold
He brought up the Thirteen Eagles as killing machines
Feelings' is not a word in his dictionary
If one member shows slight affection for another they'll be beaten up
How Yoh Xi Hung thinks and feels is how the Thirteen Eagles think and feel
Absolute obedience is necessary
I am an orphan and was sold to the gang at seven
I did all the bad things imaginable and became numb to cruelty
I can't remember how many children there were... at the start
Over ten years, the coward, the disobedient those who didn't progress in kung fu, the kind hearted ...have all been killed
Only 13 people are left
Thirteen Eagles?
Thirteen Eagles
There are only 9 of them left now
Yes...the story you made up is interesting
If you really did all those bad things all your life only to end up being persecuted by Yoh Xi Hung don't you find it ironical?
I feel you had no reason to rebel against Yoh Xi Hung
I was tired of killing
I don't believe you
You said the Thirteen Eagles were trained to be killing machines just like extensions of his sword
It's strange.
Do killing weapons have thoughts which spur them to rebel?
Weapons won't rebel but he forgot one point
I am still a human being
You appear like a man but more like a rogue
You...
Naturally you don't believe I became tired of killing
I had a strong reason for rebelling against him
One day Yoh Xi Hung assembled the Thirteen Eagles ...in the Jui Yi Hall for a conference
We hurried there
Children
Yes
Godfather, we wish you health and good fortune
Good, I just received information that the 32 security bureaus in the central area will jointly guard a cargo of royal treasures which include the invaluable red sea ginseng
In few days the treasure reaches deserted Yu Fai town
Do you now understand why I have called this meeting?
Yes
Godfather, nothing is impossible in fulfilling your wish
Right, heaven and earth can't stand in our way
You're right
Sooner or later we'll be great so we have to expand our territory
There should not be any lack of money
What I worry about is... the 32 security bureaus will bring along a lot of men
And I've heard the leader is Golden Spear Tao De Biu
Godfather, you should have confidence in us
All of us have been to many battles
Have we ever failed you?
That's what I want to hear
Good, lads, await my orders to set off
Robbers, get up
Robbers
Quick...
The Thirteen Eagles of lron Boat gang
What, the old thief Yoh Xi Hung has come too?
It's below his lordship to fight dummies
Leave him to me, you go and chase those robbers
Chase them
Yes
Go
Quick...
let's go
Go on, don't worry about me
Go quickly
Chik
Don't worry about me
Catch it...
Chase them quickly
Aunt, teach us how to write, okay?
Okay
What is this character?
Sky
Write one more time, aunt
What is this character?
Jiang, isn't that your name?
Yes, so is yours
Yes
I write it for you to see
That's right
You can't come out, go and lie down
I'll get my family
Brother...he's awake
He's up?
That's good, let's go and see
Mom
Come here
Mom
I already said he's strong and will wake up
Don't get up, lie down...
Lie down first
Yes, lie for a while, don't get up
You've been unconscious for 3 days and nights
I found you on my way home in the woods
I am indebted to you for saving my life
Don't mention it
How were you wounded?
I was ambushed by my enemy and was wounded
Luckily I escaped quickly, otherwise...
Your name please?
Cheung Gia Ran
And you?
Jiang Shun Kwai
Brother Jiang
This is my mother
Aunty
My wife
Madam
My sister Siu Fung
Miss Fung
Brother feel free to make yourself at home
Good...
Recuperate well
It's late, what are you thinking?
I thought about it thoroughly
I was too strong willed and succumbed to my temper
My actions were tainted by some evil elements
What I've seen these two months are kind, friendly faces
I have been listening to ways to live in harmony
As I grew up
I had not enjoyed family life
I will always cherish this
Miss Fung, do you believe I have killed people?
Yes, I do
How come?
If you didn't kill others... why would they come and kill you?
Don't you find me frightening?
No, I believe you'll never kill again
Miss Fung, do you want to know what I was like?
What matters is from now on you know how to lead a good life
Lead a good life?
Yes
You must remember that how to lead a good life
Godfather
What's the matter?
Your day of vengeance has come
Yien Lin
Yes
You've found him?
Yes
Wan Da has already found where Wang An is hiding
He's in the South Village near Tai Ran
Wang An
I thought I could not find you
You had me captivated such that I suffered for 2 years now I have a chance to take revenge
Godfather we will depart right now and bring Wang An to you
We are going now
Good, it doesn't matter if he's dead or alive
Godfather...
Chik Ming Sing is back
Chik...
Chik
Godfather
Chik
Godfather I'm back
It's good you've returned
I can relax now
Yien Lin couldn't find you so I thought you have been caught by the authorities
How could that be?
You taught me I should not endanger my colleagues
I'd rather be killed than be taken alive
Chik, I swore as long as you haven't come back
I'll not touch the loot
It'll always be in the vault
Thank you for your kind love
Lost it?
No
Then why haven't you brought it back with you?
Godfather
I said... these 13 silver plaques have been made by my own hands
It symbolizes your life and the whole lron Boat gang
Godfather
It represents me too yet you could forget
I dare not
Dare not?
You have deliberately disobeyed me
Godfather, you...
Godfather, I know I'm wrong
Godfather
Forget it
Chik
Yes
Let me ask you
Of the four Jiang Nan man hunters I often talk about how many have been killed?
Three
Who's left?
Devil's Plight Wang An
This time you'll really see the devil
Wang An's kung fu is not bad
Failure is not an option
Kill him and let godfather be happy
Big brother, when this is finished
I want to see a friend
Can I return a few days later?
A woman?
Chik has fallen in love with a woman
Big brother, Wang An is hiding in this valley
We must have got it wrong
There is only a family in this valley and there are no other roads
What are we doing there?
We're not wrong at all
I passed here last month and saw Wang An come out of this house
I was alone so I stayed away from him
Big brother, stop
You must be wrong
You are wrong
Wang An, come out
Come here, quick
Follow mother inside
Wait
Please don't kill the wrong person
He isn't Wang An, he saved my life
His name is Jiang Shun Kwai
What would you know?
You haven't seen him
I've seen him, he's Wang An
That's right
Would you really assist him and kill my brother?
So she is the woman you have fallen in love with
Not bad
Chik Ming Sing, tell her the purpose of your trip here
Big brother, you're pushing him
How can he say it... in front of his lover?
Let's finish the job
Stop fighting
Big brother, listen to me
What are you doing?
Listen to me
Chik
Mother...
Dear
Brother Jiang
Get lost
Brother
Chik, you're nuts
Big brother, why must we kill everyone?
I beg you, let her go
Big brother
Godfather said we should leave no one alive
You heard that yourself, dare you disobey?
Miss Fung
Didn't you chop off Wang An's head?
I couldn't bear to do it
You dare talk of feelings
I taught you this?
Did I teach you to feel?
Godfather, listen
Don't forget a minor punishment is 72 flogs, a major one is 36
You didn't only see me punish people once so it is obvious you deliberately rebel against me
I dare not, forgive me
I can do that but you must knock them down one by one otherwise you'll be punished
Godfather
Attack
Brothers, you...
Wait
Yes
I was wrong
You admit you're wrong?
I don't think you mean it
I am truly wrong
Let no more be said, torture him
I see
Since then you became tired of killing right?
Yes
From the start of this incident to the end of the other matter
I made up my mind to leave Yoh Xi Hung
I don't think so
The reason why you don't kill is you have fallen in love with Miss Siu Fung
Were it somebody else who is not emotionally involved with you ...it might not have changed your ways
Right, further up is the desert
Why don't you turn back?
There's no hurry
Your pursuers will soon catch up with you
Look
Looks like he's been dead for a few days
Damn, it must be the work of Chik Ming Sing
Chase
Friend, listen to my advice and turn back
You cannot run forever
See?
They are hot on our heels
As I suggested shall we divert their strength?
Would that not make me owe you more?
Let's go
Chik Ming Sing, you're cruel
You won't show mercy even to your brothers
When have you shown mercy to me?
I have made efforts to find this plot of land to be your burial ground, satisfied?
Lure him into the woods
Chik Ming Sing, godfather says you're smart but you've fallen into our trap this time
Your three-sectioned stick is useless in the woods
Don't worry, I won't kill you now
I'll take you back alive to face godfather
You're dreaming
Wait
I'll show you something
Double Sword in Sleeve
These two are difficult to deal with
What weapon did you use to kill them?
It's not on them?
Axe
Axe?
I asked too much
Rising up from the Heavenly-Mountain
The moon lay over the clouded ocean
And the wind that has come a thousand miles, beats at the Jade Gate battlements...
China marches its men down Baideng Road, while
Tartar troops peer across blue waters of the bay...
And since not one battle famous in history, sent all its fighters back again,
The soldiers turn round looking toward the border, eyes and think of home with wistful
And of those tonight in the upper chambers, who toss and sigh and cannot rest.
Friend, why do you suddenly have a heavy heart?
Have you changed?
This poem is Li Po's Kwan Shan Yue
It represents some peoples' sentiments meaning one could not return to one's home
I am even worse
I have no home at all
I knew you are no ordinary man and you carry a lot of hate, right?
Right
I am full of hate
I am looking for an arch villain
What an irony, I am escaping from my enemies and you're searching for your enemy
Are you joking with me?
Do I look like I'm joking?
Can I help?
No
Your future looks bleak
Chik, if you really kill Yoh Xi Hung, are you... going to restructure the gang becomebossyourself?
Are you going to recruit some killers under you?
No such interest
I will search all over for someone
Search for someone?
I have sworn that if I die...
I hope I will die at his hands because I owe him a blood debt
Who is this?
Se Ma Sun's son-in-law Cheuk Yi Fan
Have you heard of him?
No
What does he do?
Se Ma Sun is a prodigy of the martial arts world and opposes all villains
Once he thwarted Yoh Xi Hung's plans to rob official salaries at sea and created a hatred between them
So Yoh Xi Hung used the most cruel way to take revenge
Father
Master...
Father
Mercy
What?
Getting soft?
Father...
Master
Mother...sister
You...
Yoh Xi Hung, don't think you've succeeded
I curse you for killing my family you'll die an even meaner death
As long as I don't die by your hands that's fine
You'd better save your strength to report in hell
Father...
Se Ma Sun's daughter Se Ma Yu Chin is the wife of Cheuk Yi Fan, Double Sword Sleeve
This last is for you
Father
I am looking for an escape just let me give birth to the child then die
Good
Since we can't kill Cheuk Yi Fan as he's not here just as well he kill his off spring
Chik, I let you kill her
Godfather, she is a pregnant woman
You've really changed?
Chik, you used to be the first to kill and rob yet tonight you won't kill even one person
I know
You still hate me for killing Wang An, right?
No
Then let's do it
Are you killing or not?
Yes
My husband will avenge me
You can't kill a pregnant woman
Sir, you can't kill me
No explanation will do
Just brace yourself it'll be over soon
Kill
You killed her?
I made a decision at that moment
I could not die then
No one on Se Ma Sun's family wanted to die so I had to live on to kill Yoh Xi Hung
Can you do it alone?
I know it's almost impossible but I must succeed
Don't forget, at his side are always
Lin Gin Ming and Fan Lun
Let's go further we'll meet Vulture Yien Lin, Blue Eagle Wan Da
The Owl Shou Kao Shing
I've heard that among the Thirteen Eagles
Vulture Yien Lin has the best kung fu
The second one is Blue Eagle Wan Da and the third is you Black Eagle Chik Ming Sing
You're well informed on the lron Boat gang's background
You'll have a hard time fighting them alone if you don't have a partner like me you will die
Friend, we're not related in any way
You've already helped me twice
Not for fame or money so why did you do it?
Not for anything, it doesn't matter
Then can you tell me your name?
Those words again, homeless...
That's enough...
Damn, what rotten luck
The first batch has gone for half a month the second batch has gone for ten days
Why is there no news of them?
Right
Chik doesn't have guts to travel by sea
This is entire dominated by us
We have reconnaissance in the city
Then there are those officials who are dying to capture him
That's why we have concluded he must have gone into the desert
But...
Big brother, there is no way that Chik could ...handle a few people by himself
Don't underestimate him
His kung fu is good and he is smart
Godfather picked him because of these attributes
But he misjudged him not realising he would be a rebel
I don't respect Chik
Alright...stop arguing
Ten miles from here is a small town
Pass that is the barren desert
Tomorrow we'll check it out
Sir
Boss...we have customers
At last
Please, sir
Will this be enough to buy your inn?
I can't sell it, it's my business
How can you do this?
Can you outrun a rabbit?
Sir, naturally the rabbit will run faster
Is your head harder than the table?
Sir, what exactly do you want?
I want you to get out of here right now
Yes
Get lost quicker than a rabbit
Yes
Or I'll smash your head
Wait
Don't forget the silver on the table
You can use it for lodgings and food
Come back after a month
Yes
There'll be a couple of corpses here by then
There'll be a couple of corpses here?
Please bury them
Yes
Let's go
Wait
Leave your clothes
My clothes?
Sir, I...
Strip
Yes
So you want to dress up as a waiter?
Yes
This is the last inn before the desert unless they don't come after you if they do they must rest here
But they won't be easily deceived
You're wrong, the smarter one is, the easier one will be deceived because they think they're smart
Are you still around?
Get lost
Yes, let's go
We must get rid of one of them first
I agree
Waiter, prepare food
Great...gentlemen...here's business
Gentlemen...have a seat
It's rare to have customers at our place
This is for taking the dust off you this is for soothing your weariness
this is for quenching your thirst
Waiter, ask your boss to come out
I am the owner and the waiter
I take care of the whole place here
Just tell me what you need
Then prepare a month's ration for the three of us
Yes...
Come back
Have you seen two groups of people, seven altogether pass by here towards the desert?
Let me think
Ah, I've got it...
There was a one-eyed gentlemen who was very generous with his money
The bone is crushed
I ask you again, have you seen someone aged about twenty seven, dressed in black with a three-sectioned stick pass here?
I can't speak, please let go first
Speak up
Yes...
The batch last time also asked about this person
I told them but they wouldn't believe me and headed towards the desert to look for him
What didn't they believe?
The fact that, that person in black was... helping me with the dishes and other chores upstairs
They didn't believe me
Impossible.
Would Chik work here?
Right, he can't bear such tasks
What does he look like?
Ordinary looking, under thirty dressed in black
Don't let his huge appearance deceive you he is lazy and eats a lot;
not a good thing
Right, also his leg seems to have some problem
Let me see...ah yes, it's his left leg
He walks like this, see?
He's walking with a limp
He seems to have a huge problem with his leg
Enough
Old Six
Yes
Follow him and have a look
Yes
Gentlemen may I go now?
Go on
I'll go and prepare food and wine
I'll be right with you
Please
Please
Please
Get up
Get up...
Cao Gao Shing
It's you
One down
It won't be easy to deal with Yien Lin and Wan Da
What about an ambush?
It's risky
We must kill one with only one strike otherwise...
Let's do it then
Stay up here, I'll go down
Be alert
Be careful of Yien Lin's Lethal Ring and his head, which can crush a rock
Here's food and wine
That gentleman said the kid in the kitchen is not the person you're looking for
He's gone to the toilet with stomach trouble
That's good, he'll eat more
We have a house rule the first pot of wine is for travellers from afar
It's free
Cheers
Waiter, where's the toilet?
In the alley behind the kitchen
Old Two, go and take a look
The back of the kitchen
Not a bad knife, right?
How much has Chik Ming Sing paid to hire you?
Can I be bought?
Then who are you?
Killer of pigs
Old Two
Don't waste your breath, he can't answer you nor can he help you
Chik, even if someone helped you to kill me you can't escape Godfather
I don't want to run anymore, I'll go and see him
Friend, in such circumstances you should not speak too much, or you'll get soft and can't bear to kill
Do you want to know who I am?
You are...
I'll say it only once, listen carefully
I am Cheuk Yi Fan
Chik
A bunch of nincompoops
No news up to now
In a few days we'll go to lron Boat gang
You are aware Yoh Xi Hung's kung fu is not easy to deal with
He also has two loyal followers
Grey Eagle and Yellow Eagle
It's not an even match you should...
I should flee to escape death, right?
Yes
Aren't you afraid to die?
Die?
Everyone is afraid to die the question is what is one dying for?
I did too many bad deeds and I hope I could atone for my sins with my life
If I could live, all the better but if I die, I die in peace
You have helped me a lot and you have saved my life
I should involve you in this
Chik Ming Sing, I haven't helped you in vain
I may be an enemy
What do you mean?
Don't get me wrong
I am just saying there is no certainty in this world
I was just stating a universal truism
Maybe your enemy is my enemy and you have done me a favour
We have a complicated relationship
It's actually quite simple
We're getting more intimate
We need each other
Your enemy is Yoh Xi Hung mine is the lron Boat gang
You have a grudge against them?
Everyone wants to kill outlaws not necessarily because of vengeance
Excluding you
Unless you team up with you there is no better way
Chik Ming Sing is back...
Chik Ming Sing, you dare come back...
Traitor
I guessed right, Chik will always be Chik
You've killed Yien Lin
Why haven't you fled?
Why return to die?
If I don't kill you I won't have peace
This person must have come to accompany you to die
Wrong, I've come to dig your grave
Let's see about that
Double Sword in Sleeve Cheuk Yi Fan
Correct
Chik, so much for good judgement you've found an enemy to help you
You'll die for sure
So it's really you
Why didn't you kill me on the road to avenge your wife?
I want to find the truth about the death of Se Ma Sun's family
But I have said earlier, our grudge should not have lasted till now
because we should join hands and kill our common enemy Yoh Xi Hung
Alright then
Yoh Xi Hung, you've always eradicated your enemy but you left me alive
That means your time has come
Although you two have joined forces you might not gain the upper hand
Chik, death or alive is before you
Listen to me
Help me get rid of Cheuk Yi Fan and I'll forget the past
Cheuk Yi Fan, you want to use him to get rid of me then kill him afterwards
Chik, you've been tricked
You should know that getting rid of me isn't that easy
You tried your best but you'll die ultimately
I will persist to avenge my wife
Chik, you'd better help me get rid of him
I don't think your three-sectioned stick is a match for 'Double Sword in Sleeve'
Let's join forces
Don't be tricked by him
Would you forget I killed the twelve Eagles?
They're all dead, what's the big deal?
Besides, you didn't kill them all by yourself
I have no children and the gang's... entire wealth will be bequeathed to you one day
Chik Ming Sing, you must understand;
If we fight, he'll be the winner
But there is nothing to support your promise
You've been with me since you were young when have I gone back on my word ...and lied to you?
Godfather, you must stand by your words
Stand by your words
Cheuk Yi Fan, he killed your pregnant wife
If you want to take revenge...please
Dog
Your loved ones have all died because of you
Friend, I can't change my ways besides, I'd rather stay alive than have a good death
Chik, what are you waiting for?
Do it, quick
Yoh Xi Hung, your cruelty over these twenty years ...have been wasted
So it's easy to raise someone... but difficult to control his heart
I have at last understood this and am able to discern right and wrong
Cheuk Yi Fan, take your revenge
Your wife's murderer is still alive
My enemies are all dead
I swore I'll die by your sword
If you don't kill me... your wife would not rest in peace
I, Princess Strella, descendant of the Royal Kings of Tara,
Mistress of the domains of Thorvald, Mortgarde and Freya, do humbly offer my loyalty to the King and hereby recognise his suzerainty over me and all whom I command.
No!
-Are you mad?
-Seize him!
He's killed the Princess!
Stop!
That's not the Princess!
It's an android.
How did you know?
A circuit must have been faulty.
I heard it spark.
And who might you be, pray?
But it doesn't make sense.
Why send an android to swear loyalty to the King?
To get close enough to kill him.
But who would want to kill the King?
Unless...
My dear Archimandrite, what are you suggesting?
-Treachery against His Majesty.
-Take care what you say, Zadek.
Your Eminence, I suggest we postpone the oath-taking for the time being.
Who knows how many other programmed androids there may be?
You think there are more?
It is a possibility we must face, Your Eminence.
I shall leave my own personal guard here to protect His Majesty.
-I'm afraid I cannot permit that, Count.
-It is not for you to say.
As commander of His Majesty's bodyguard, it is my decision and mine alone.
You presume too much, Zadek!
Well, what does His Majesty have to say on the matter?
He is very quiet.
His Majesty is very tired.
-Can't you talk about this tomorrow?
-Who the devil are you, sir?
-I'm the King's doctor.
-Is His Majesty ill?
No, nothing a nice rest won't cure.
He'll be all right tomorrow.
I understand, Doctor.
Come, Count.
We must allow His Majesty to rest.
-But what of the danger?
-What possible danger can His Majesty be in from his own personal bodyguard, Count?
Hmm?
Will he be all right tomorrow?
Not unless I can recharge his power packs and repair his speech circuits.
-Is this yours?
-Yes.
-What is it?
-What is it?
Yes.
What is it made of?
I've no idea.
I only found it the other day.
It's like no substance I've ever seen before.
I have blunted two diamond drills on it.
-Perhaps it's some kind of quartz.
-This is no quartz.
Well, if you don't want it, could I have it back?
You've no use for it, have you?
Well, I don't suppose it matters.
What could you possibly do with it?
-No.
-Why not?
I'm curious.
It looks as though it might be part of something.
Part of what?
It failed!
The machine failed!
That doctor saw at once it was an android.
My lord, I did warn you it wasn't ready.
What doctor?
Oh, some strange doctor who's attending the Prince.
We hold the real prince.
What you have seen must have been an android.
Obviously.
-Do you know this doctor?
-No.
I think you do.
Lamia, prepare another android, an exact copy, precise to the last detail.
I have an idea.
Our guest can help us.
-Master!
-K9.
I have located the mistress.
She is in Castle Gracht.
-Are you sure?
-Affirmative, master.
I detected her presence quite distinctly.
Good.
Well, that means the Count has Romana, the real Princess and the Prince.
So Grendel now holds all the cards.
No!
I wouldn't say that.
We've still got a prince of sorts.
He has to attend the convocation with the Archimandrite and the priests.
Will he be able to?
Well...
K9, what would happen if I connect the carbon circuit to the silicon circuit?
How long would they last?
Come on, K9.
Three hours, nine minutes and 1 0.7 seconds, approximately.
Comfortable, my dear?
My lord.
-What is it?
These are like no alpha waves I have ever seen before.
-What do you mean?
-She is not Taran.
-Then what is she?
-I don't know.
-I need more time for evaluation.
-Time we don't have, my dear.
Just programme another android to kill, that's all.
But this time make sure it's a perfect copy.
Yes, my lord.
Go on, ask him a question.
Go on.
A question of monastic lands, that's bound to come up at the convocation.
What is His Majesty's position on that?
Monastic lands are held by the religious orders under the protection of the Crown.
Those lands and that protection may be withdrawn at my discretion at any time.
Good.
I propose to be discreet for the time being.
Yes.
-Doctor, the Prince...
-King!
-Quite so, Your Majesty.
-Zadek.
Oh, drat!
I keep forgetting he's only an android.
Doctor, the King seems to be...
How shall I say, a trifle more...
-Intelligent than the real one?
-Yes.
Well, of course he is.
I programmed him.
We don't want him too intelligent, Doctor.
-Hmm?
-You can't trust androids, you know.
It's funny, you know.
That's what some androids say about people.
-What?
-Anyway, how can you possibly be frightened of something that goes pfft if it short-circuits?
-Someone to speak to the Doctor, sir.
-Who?
My name is Till.
I am but a servant to the Count.
What do you want?
My mission is with the Doctor, Swordsman, not with thee.
You dare to refuse to speak to a Master of the Sword?
Swordsman!
I will speak only to the Doctor.
Those are my orders.
Quite right, too.
Quite right.
We peasants have got to stick together.
Now then, what can I do for you, huh?
-I have a message from Madame Lamia.
-Lamia?
Yeah.
She's Count Grendel's woman.
A peasant.
Well?
She would have me tell you that she fears for the Count's safety.
Why?
Now they've crowned the android King, the Count is politically powerless.
Come over here.
-I suppose he can be trusted.
-Who, the servant or the Doctor?
The Doctor, of course.
-He can be trusted, can't he, sir?
-I wish we knew more about him.
-There's only one way to settle this.
-Do not activate your sword.
Good dog.
Good dog.
-Lamia's offered us a deal.
What?
Romana in exchange for the safe conduct out of the country of Count Grendel.
-You refused, of course.
-No, no.
I accepted.
I'm to take a written undertaking from you and the King for Grendel's safety, and Lamia and her friends will pass Romana over to me.
-It's an obvious trap.
You can't go.
-Yes, I can.
Where is the meeting to take place?
At a place called the Pavilion of the Summer Winds.
You know where it is?
Yes, it's on Grendel's estate, in the woods near the castle.
Good.
I shall have to go alone, of course.
It's funny.
They always want you to go alone when you're walking into a trap.
Have you noticed that?
You've excelled yourself, my dear Lamia.
It's absolutely perfect.
-Don't you agree?
-The Doctor'll spot it immediately.
In the dark at a distance of 20 feet?
I think not, my dear!
He'll know it's a trap.
Of course!
That's what gives the situation such a delicious edge.
-He won't come.
-You underestimate your friend, my dear.
Of course he'll come.
What else can he do?
It's his only chance of rescuing you.
He'll be very careful, very cautious.
He'll bide his time.
But sooner or later he must find out if that figure in the Pavilion is you or not.
And when he does...
Show her, Lamia.
Hello, Romana.
How are you?
Rather ingenious, don't you think?
You are to be congratulated, my dear.
How did you get the voice?
The Count's man Till recorded his voice patterns when they parleyed.
Once I have the pattern, the construction of speech is a simple matter.
-It won't work.
-Why not?
Supposing the Doctor doesn't speak?
The android is also programmed to kill in various other ways.
You see before you the complete killing machine.
As beautiful as you and as deadly as the plague.
If only she were real, I'd marry her!
You deserve each other.
Come, my dear.
Guard!
Guard!
What kept you so long?
Bring this one back to the cells.
Leave us.
I will lock up the prisoner.
You know, if Grendel does become king, he'll never make you his queen.
Nor you, either.
I will see to that.
But I don't want him.
And you do, don't you?
Look, why don't you let me go?
All you have to do is release me and the Doctor and I'll leave Tara.
Think about it.
What have you got to lose?
Grendel.
Well, you haven't exactly got him now, have you?
All he's doing is using you.
I know.
But that is better than nothing.
Now, how does the Doctor do this?
Steady, K9, steady.
Let's take a look.
Shh!
We're getting out of here.
-Save yourself.
-And leave you behind?
They'll kill you.
I'm too weak.
I'd only get in the way.
Listen, Grendel's taken most of the guards with him.
Now's our chance.
Then take it.
Don't waste time with me.
Tell Zadek where I am.
He'll know what to do.
That's it.
-Okay.
Like that.
Good.
-Ready?
-Go ahead.
Guard!
Guard!
Guard, quickly, the Prince!
My lord.
The men are in position, my lord.
Good.
Await my signal.
Tell them to be ready.
Yes, sir.
-You know what to do, my dear?
-Yes.
When this Doctor arrives, you leave him to me.
What should I do without you?
Find another peasant who understands androids, no doubt.
True.
But I should not find one who pleased me so much.
Go now, before he arrives.
Go, Charger!
Start!
Start!
Go, you stupid creature, go!
-Hello.
You're early.
-Doctor?
-Yes.
Madame Lamia, is it?
-We agreed to meet at midnight.
Yes, but I had nothing better to do, so I thought I'd come early.
-What's your reason?
-Do I need one?
No, but it would've been fun to hear it.
-Where's Romana?
-You agree to my terms?
I do indeed.
Safe conduct for Count Grendel in return for Romana, also safe and sound.
-Yes.
-Where is Romana?
You realise that Count Grendel will have to go into exile.
But there's no reason why you can't go into exile with him, is there?
-Where's Romana?
-Outside.
Bring her in.
It's a good offer, Lamia.
A fair offer.
Well, Doctor, aren't you going to greet your friend?
Caution, master!
What is it, K9?
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
-In focus, K9?
-Affirmative.
Now!
Something's gone wrong.
Attack the Pavilion!
My lord!
My lord!
You fools, that was Madame Lamia!
Hold your fire!
Doctor!
I know you're in there.
There's only one entrance to that pavilion.
Come out, Doctor!
Surrender!
We won't harm you!
Tell the bowmen to fire immediately they see the target.
I want him destroyed.
Well, Doctor?
Are you coming out?
You have my word as a Gracht you will not be harmed.
-Ill-advised, master.
-What?
You just leave it to me, K9.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
Liar!
-Time we got out of here, K9.
-Affirmative, master.
-Round here, do you think?
-Affirmative.
Come on!
There he is.
He's got out.
1 0,000 gold pieces to the man who shoots the Doctor!
Wait.
Listen.
The Princess!
Hold your fire!
Everyone for himself, K9!
Fools!
That wasn't the Princess, it was Romana!
After them!
Hope you know how to stop this thing when we get there.
While Grendel thinks we're still in the palace, we may be able to surprise him.
You must bring up a troop of bowmen under cover of darkness and position them on the left flank here.
-Doctor!
-It's the Princess!
No, I'm Romana.
Incredible!
-Isn't it?
-Ah, this must be the android king.
-Yes, we call him George.
-And these gentlemen?
-They're real, I think.
This is Swordsman Farrah.
I am Swordmaster Zadek.
Zadek?
I have a message for you from the real king.
-You've seen His Majesty?
How is he?
-He is not very well.
-We must think of a plan to rescue him.
-Horseman approaching!
Under a flag of truce.
It's Count Grendel!
I'll kill the traitor!
Not if he comes under a flag of truce.
You know the articles of war, Swordsman.
I'm not sure Count Grendel does, sir.
Disarm the Count, then, and bring him in.
Good day, gentlemen.
I come to you under a flag of truce and expect to be treated according to the usages of war.
What do you want?
How are you, Your Android Majesty?
I am well.
He doesn't sound it.
Power packs need recharging I expect.
-Nothing that can't be fixed, Count.
-Oh, Doctor!
Well, there you are.
I was glad you managed to escape safely.
Yes.
Well, so was I.
Tell me, where is the charming Romana?
What do you want, Count Grendel?
Only a word with the Doctor, according to the usages of war.
Shall we?
Excellent.
Well?
-Doctor, you're a remarkable man.
-I am?
-Yeah.
A man after my own heart.
-I am?
Here you are, new to Taran politics, and in no time at all, what have you become?
-Go on, you tell me.
-Kingmaker extraordinary.
Thanks to you keeping that micro-circuitry going,
Zadek has his king.
But have you thought what would happen if something went seriously wrong, like an overload on the circuits?
-What would happen?
-Your usefulness ceases.
You know too much.
You become a dangerous embarrassment to Zadek.
An embarrassment to be got rid of, and don't think he wouldn't.
What's the answer?
Suppose we both unmade our kings.
No more King Reynart at all.
-What?
What would that achieve?
-A vacancy for a new king.
Ah.
-You, I suppose?
-No, no, no, Doctor.
There would be opposition.
No.
I was thinking you'd make an excellent king.
Me?
Just a moment.
The Count's just offered me the throne.
That's treason, Count!
Only so long as the king is alive!
Seize him!
-Why did you do that?
-Because he's got Romana.
Look.
Stop!
Let me go!
Doctor!
Doctor, help me!
(DOCTOR WHO THEME)
I, Princess Strella, descendant of the Royal Kings of Tara,
Mistress of the domains of Thorvald, Mortgarde and Freya, do humbly offer my loyalty to the King and hereby recognise his suzerainty over me and all whom I command.
No!

-LAMIA:
My lord.
-What is it?
(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)
These are like no alpha waves I have ever seen before.

-In focus, K9?
-Affirmative.
DOCTOR:
Now!
Something's gone wrong.
Attack the Pavilion!
My lord!
My lord!
You fools, that was Madame Lamia!
Hold your fire!
Doctor!
I know you're in there.
There's only one entrance to that pavilion.
Come out, Doctor!
Surrender!
We won't harm you!
Tell the bowmen to fire immediately they see the target.
I want him destroyed.
Well, Doctor?
Are you coming out?
You have my word as a Gracht you will not be harmed.
-Ill-advised, master.
-What?
You just leave it to me, K9.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
Liar!
-Time we got out of here, K9.
-Affirmative, master.
(FIRING CONTINUES)
-Round here, do you think?
-Affirmative.
Come on!
(FIRING CONTINUES)
There he is.
He's got out.
1 0,000 gold pieces to the man who shoots the Doctor!
Wait.
Listen.
The Princess!
Hold your fire!
Everyone for himself, K9!
Fools!
That wasn't the Princess, it was Romana!
After them!
DOCTOR:
Hope you know how to stop this thing when we get there.
While Grendel thinks we're still in the palace, we may be able to surprise him.
You must bring up a troop of bowmen under cover of darkness and position them on the left flank here.
-Doctor!
-It's the Princess!
No, I'm Romana.
-ZADEK:
Incredible!
-Isn't it?
-Ah, this must be the android king.
-Yes, we call him George.
-And these gentlemen?
-They're real, I think.
This is Swordsman Farrah.
I am Swordmaster Zadek.
Zadek?
I have a message for you from the real king.
-You've seen His Majesty?
How is he?
-He is not very well.
-We must think of a plan to rescue him.
-Horseman approaching!
Under a flag of truce.
It's Count Grendel!
I'll kill the traitor!
Not if he comes under a flag of truce.
You know the articles of war, Swordsman.
I'm not sure Count Grendel does, sir.
Disarm the Count, then, and bring him in.
Good day, gentlemen.
I come to you under a flag of truce and expect to be treated according to the usages of war.
What do you want?
How are you, Your Android Majesty?
(VERY SLOWLY) I am well.
He doesn't sound it.
Power packs need recharging I expect.
-Nothing that can't be fixed, Count.
-Oh, Doctor!
Well, there you are.
I was glad you managed to escape safely.
Yes.
Well, so was I.
Tell me, where is the charming Romana?
What do you want, Count Grendel?
Only a word with the Doctor, according to the usages of war.
Shall we?
Excellent.
Well?
-Doctor, you're a remarkable man.
-I am?
-Yeah.
A man after my own heart.
-I am?
Here you are, new to Taran politics, and in no time at all, what have you become?
-Go on, you tell me.
-Kingmaker extraordinary.
Thanks to you keeping that micro-circuitry going,
Zadek has his king.
But have you thought what would happen if something went seriously wrong, like an overload on the circuits?
-What would happen?
-Your usefulness ceases.
You know too much.
You become a dangerous embarrassment to Zadek.
An embarrassment to be got rid of, and don't think he wouldn't.
What's the answer?
Suppose we both unmade our kings.
No more King Reynart at all.
-What?
What would that achieve?
-A vacancy for a new king.
Ah.
-You, I suppose?
-No, no, no, Doctor.
There would be opposition.
No.
I was thinking you'd make an excellent king.
Me?
Just a moment.
The Count's just offered me the throne.
That's treason, Count!
Only so long as the king is alive!
Seize him!
-Why did you do that?
-Because he's got Romana.
Look.
ROMANA:
Stop!
Let me go!
Doctor!
Doctor, help me!
We gonna do to J.R. Ewing what he did to me.
Get to his women the way he got to mine.
Bad storm blowing in.
Hands are off.
J.R. And Ray aren't back yet.
Relax.
They'll be back soon.
Besides, I made dinner plans for us.
Dinner?
When J.R. And Ray get there, it'll be okay.
You know what the nicest part of all this is?
- What?
- Those ladies are so pretty.
It'd be a hard choice, ain't it?
You're gonna give us a show, Miss Texas.
Stay right there.
I swear I'll shoot.
- J.R.
- Yeah?
- Gotta get going.
- All right.
Just gotta pick up my things.
Damn.
Need any help?
No, I don't think so.
I got everything.
You say goodbye to Mary Lou?
Sure did.
Bye, Wanda.
You take care now, hear?
Okay...
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- You drive.
- You bet.
Well, goodbye, Waco.
Nice town, full of pretty ladies.
There it is.
- What the heck are you guys...?
- Shut up!
- What the heck are you guys...?
- You shut your mouth.
- Not in there.
- Hey, look, we're sorry.
Just take care of yourself, all right?
See who's in there.
Oh, hey, cut it out, baby.
You're hurting me.
Listen.
Honey, it isn't what you think.
- Hey, what?
- Nobody here.
- Just old Mary Lou.
That's nobody.
- You didn't used to think I was nobody.
Shut up.
My brother-in-law is meeting with his wife.
Payton, please!
It's between you and your hubby, sis.
You ain't going nowhere.
Now, which one of you is gonna tell us what's been going on here?
Lover left his calling card.
"J.R. Ewing."
Southfork, Braddock, Texas.
Boy, I wish I could sleep in a car.
We'll be home in an hour, J.R.
No rush.
Hands are off.
Fiesta day.
Yeah, there's nothing to do around there, anyway.
We worked our butts off selling that cattle.
Nobody's gonna begrudge us a good time.
Wanda and Mary Lou.
Wonder how them broads get that way sometimes.
Just like us looking for a good time.
- They found it.
Morning.
Time for the 8:00 news break.
A windstorm, which blew in unexpectedly from the Gulf of Mexico, has brought all activity in Houston to a halt.
Gusts of up to 100 miles per hour closed the airport and some of the major highways in the area, devastating downtown.
The storm is moving across the state in a northwesterly direction.
Small craft advisories are posted and the highway...
We better hurry up home before it hits.
I brought you some lunch, Miss Ellie.
That's sweet.
But I don't think I could eat anything right now.
I'll put it down just in case.
- J.R. Back yet?
- Any time.
I'll check on you a little later.
No.
No, please.
The boredom is almost as bad as the migraine.
Sue Ellen I've been thinking...
How can I put this?
Maybe you and I should...
Should try to make Pam more comfortable here.
Comfortable?
I think we've been thinking of her as Digger Barnes' daughter, not Bobby's wife.
But, Miss Ellie, J.R. Says that...
J.R. Is as stubborn as Jock.
He doesn't like change, that's all.
Especially when the change is named Barnes.
But as far as I can see Pam's good for Bobby.
Very good.
I wish they could turn that thing off in here.
Somebody's got it.
Thank goodness.
No, sweetheart.
Everything's fine.
Why shouldn't it be?
Somebody said something about a storm coming in.
Might even be a hurricane.
- A hurricane?
Are you serious?
- Yeah.
- Ray and J.R. Back yet?
- No.
If they're not back in an hour, call me.
Oh, Bobby, I'm born and raised in Texas, just like you.
- I've lived through hurricanes before.
- You're also a city girl.
A storm is one thing in a city.
It's something else again on a ranch.
- Okay, baby.
I'll call you.
- Okay.
I love you.
Bye.
I love you.
Bye-bye.
A hurricane?
Yeah.
It's what he said.
Heading this way.
Well, maybe that's what's holding up J.R.
Could be.
I'll see if I can get some news on the radio.
Mind telling me what you're doing home from school at this hour?
As a matter of fact, yes, I do mind.
In Bryan, Temple and Waco the storm has already left devastation.
That's why.
They let us out of school early, just in case.
- Winds, which are gusting in excess of 100 miles per hour.
The storm is still moving in a northwesterly direction .
And, unless it suddenly veers off, is expected to hit the...
Lucy, you know where those oil lamps are?
Yeah.
Get them out and start filling them up.
Check the flashlight batteries too.
Pamela, check all the windows.
Make sure they're closed in your room and Lucy's.
I'll take care of the rest of the house.
La-di-da.
Who does she think she is, giving us orders like that?
Somebody who knows what to do around here with a storm coming.
Which puts her one up on me and you.
Hey, Bobby.
Half a day today, huh?
- Oh, hi, Daddy.
How'd your luncheon go?
- Those Jaycee luncheons never change.
I guess that's why I like them so much.
Where you going?
Home.
Bad storm blowing in.
Hands are off.
J.R. And Ray aren't back yet.
Relax.
They'll be back soon.
- Besides, I made dinner plans for us.
- Dinner?
Yeah.
I ran into Punk Anderson and some of the boys and got to tell them about you, what a fine executive you've turned out to be.
I bet they didn't believe that.
We'll show them another time.
Why don't you wait and call home later.
As soon as J.R. And Ray get there, everything will be okay.
- Sure.
- Okay.
Should be down this road.
Terrific.
What are we gonna do when we get there?
We gonna do to J.R. Ewing what he did to me.
Get to his women the way he got to mine.
Sounds like fun.
- How are we gonna do it?
- How do I know?
Gotta find out what's there.
Who's there.
Go change your clothes.
We gotta take care of the livestock.
Bring the truck up to the house.
- Hello, J.R.
- Oh, morning, Sue Ellen.
Morning.
How you doing, honey?
How are things?
Just fine.
So far.
Miss Ellie has a migraine, though.
I'd better look in on her.
Yeah.
- J.R.
- Yeah?
- Why didn't you call me last night?
- I was working late.
Why didn't you call me this morning?
I don't have time to talk about it, Sue Ellen.
Gotta get on the road round up some strays.
Ray and I gotta change clothes.
Yes?
Sorry, ma'am.
We're in trouble.
Can we use your phone?
On 289, about 5 miles west of Braddock near the Southfork Ranch.
Yeah.
I'll hold on.
Probably nothing serious.
Carburetor, maybe.
But in all this wind and dust, no way to fix anything.
I can imagine.
We hate busting in like this.
Not another word about it, Mr. Frick.
He's Frick.
This is Allen.
Yes, ma'am.
Payton Allen.
Ms. Ewing, I'd be glad to start a fire in the fireplace.
Seems like you need one.
Well, that'd be nice.
Lucy, you show Mr. Allen where everything is and I'll go make us some sandwiches and coffee.
- Follow me.
- As quick as you can, huh?
I appreciate it.
The auto club says it'll be about two or three hours.
- Storm's blocked some roads.
- Not surprising.
Why don't you relax in the living room, Mr. Frick.
If there's anything we can do to help, just holler.
I'm gonna get us all some lunch, and then maybe later I'll take you up on that offer.
- At least we ain't gonna be freeloading.
- What?
We'll have to earn our keep today, Allen.
Doesn't look like there's much help here.
It's the Feast of San Antonio.
Everybody has the day off.
You can count on us.
- What about your men folk?
- My uncle and the foreman are here.
- They'll be back in a minute.
- I might've known.
I know I'd never leave somebody who looks like you alone.
We were alone up until half an hour ago.
That's the story of my life!
Thirty minutes the wrong side of paradise.
Where were they?
- Your uncle and that foreman?
- I don't know.
Waco or someplace.
I'd better help Sue Ellen.
You don't go away, now, you hear?
I hear.
I hear.
- Waco.
That's them.
- It's better than I figured.
Hands being away...
Think all of them are gone?
They're sure giving us a chance to find out.
Ain't nobody I can't outsmart when I set my mind to it.
Like that guy you outsmarted in Houston just for talking to Wanda, by kicking his head in.
That's right.
That's right.
He got what was coming to him.
Just like these Ewings are gonna get theirs.
Hey, I'm with you.
- Are you, Allen?
- Hey!
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Now, I come here for my justice.
You seem to find this whole thing very funny.
Hey, man, I didn't mean nothing.
You and me gotta stick together.
See how the Ewings like it when their women are treated the way they treat ours.
That's right.
Hello.
Howdy.
Luther Frick, Payton Allen, my aunt, Pamela Ewing.
Their truck broke down outside, and they're gonna lend us a hand.
- Pretty nice of them, isn't it?
- Our pleasure, ma'am.
Truly, our pleasure.
The storm, which did so much damage earlier today in Houston is moving rapidly toward Dallas and the Metroplex area.
Winds in the Waco area are reported to have reached as high as 130 miles per hour.
- My daddy still here?
- In his office.
- In Temple, where the roof of a bakery collapsed, killing the owner.
Windows have been shattered in many of the city's homes and businesses.
Driving everywhere is extremely hazardous.
In Waco, the storm toppled...
Get me the ranch on the phone, Janine.
I think we had better go home.
I live in town, so I'm okay.
But aren't you safer here than driving, I mean?
- I don't know.
Hello?
Oh, J.R., just a minute.
Bobby called.
- Hello?
- J.R.?
Am I glad to hear you.
- When'd you get home?
- Half-hour ago.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.
Ray and I are gonna shore up the ranch.
- I can be home soon.
No, don't do that.
The roads are impossible.
You'll need help, J.R. The hands are gone.
A couple of strangers showed up.
Their car broke down and...
Their bad luck is our good luck, I guess.
They're gonna help Ray and me.
- J.R., I can be there.
- Listen, I don't have time to talk now.
You take care, huh?
All right?
Bye.
Now you two guys get in the back.
- Now wait a minute.
Where're you going?
- I'm gonna help.
- Allen, come with me.
- I'll get my horse.
Your horse is over there.
Right!
Get that black-and-white calf.
Tie them up to the post.
- All set.
- Hang on!
- Swing around.
- Hey!
Come on, now!
Yeah!
Come on, now.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Come on, now!
Get on there!
Bring them on around!
Around, now, around!
Ray fell!
Let's get back.
You all right?
Easy, easy.
- Stay there.
- I'll find J.R.
- Don't move!
- J.R.?
J.R., Ray's hurt!
- Yeah, what's the matter?
- Ray's hurt.
He's in the pasture.
Don't move your leg!
They're coming.
Get that tailgate down.
All right, easy.
Easy, Ray.
Let's get him in the jeep.
- Grab his leg.
- Which leg?
- Which?
- Here.
Easy, now.
- All right.
- Take it easy.
Get him up.
- All right.
- Okay?
All right.
Get your blanket.
Lucy, get those horses back to the stable.
I got it.
I got it.
- Hang on!
- All set!
It's all right.
I'm awake.
- You feeling better?
- A little.
How're you all making out in this wind?
We're holding our own.
The others are still out there, though.
Miss Ellie do you think it's a good idea to be getting up like that?
Well, I can't think of another way right now.
Well, maybe I could get you a...
A what?
I'm not as sick as all that, thank you.
Looks like Ray Krebbs got hurt.
Oh, I'd better go see if I can help.
This is Lucy Ewing.
Is Dr. Miller there?
It's very important.
Tell him to call as soon as he gets in, okay?
- Let's get him in here.
- Hurry!
Take him in the living room.
Right there.
- Is it bad, Ray?
- No.
Okay, boys.
I don't think it's broken.
The doctor's stuck somewhere in the storm.
They say he'd call as soon as he gets back.
Luther, you know what the nicest part of all this is?
- What?
- Those ladies are so pretty.
- It's gonna be a hard choice, ain't it?
- Not for me.
- No?
- Any way we choose is a winner.
Real pretty.
Now, look, boys.
If it's money you want I'll show you where it is.
We don't have much here, but you're welcome to it.
We ain't no thieves.
We don't want your money.
Then what have you come here for?
Take another guess.
Anybody?
The three of us?
That could play a part, but it ain't the answer.
- We ain't no criminals, lady.
- Right.
Get wise, cowboy.
What's the matter, sugarplum?
Thought you were a fun-loving lady.
This is gonna be a lot of fun if you take it in the right spirit.
We come here for justice.
- Justice?
What kind of justice?
The only kind of justice poor, working men like us can get the kind we get on our own.
All right, you.
Hey, you, countess!
Now, move.
Move it!
Come on, move!
Come on, come on!
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.
Is everything all right there?
Fine, Bobby.
Good.
You get the hatches battened down?
- Yes.
Oh, Ray Krebbs hurt his knee.
- Is it serious?
I don't know.
J.R. Thinks it's dislocated.
You coming home?
No.
Daddy wants me to stay in town, what with the storm and all.
That sounds like a good idea.
You have a nice time.
Honey...
J.R. And I were just about to sit down to an afternoon of backgammon, anyway.
Backgammon?
You and J.R.?
I've gotta go now, honey.
Bye-bye.
Yeah.
Sure, goodbye.
Since we're stuck in town for the night, I'll call Punk and tell him dinner's on.
- No, Daddy.
I want to go home.
- You said J.R. And Ray were back.
- Well, they are but Pam didn't sound right, like something was wrong.
She said she was gonna sit down to a game of backgammon with J.R.
Well, what's wrong with that?
You want them to get along, don't you?
I don't even think she knows how to play backgammon.
- Let's go home.
- Oh, Bobby, you're acting like an old lady.
Maybe I am, but I want to be sure.
- You coming?
- Yeah, I reckon.
What are you gonna do with us?
We were gonna get up a softball game, but the weather...
- Look, fellas, if you're here for justice...
- Shut up.
We'll prove it.
This is your wife, right?
Yes.
Pretty.
Don't touch me.
Now, bravery's gonna get you dead, Junior.
Hey, you.
You!
- You married?
- No.
That gives us a choice.
Hey, you know, I'm married too, mister.
Yeah.
My wife's name is Wanda.
You know her?
- No, I don't know any Wandas.
- Well, you...
You got a short memory.
I just can't remember anybody by the name of Wanda.
She says she knows you pretty good.
You know Wanda didn't come home last night?
Me and her brother here we went looking for her.
And guess where we found her this morning.
We found her in this old motel room.
Her and her friend, Mary Lou.
- So...?
- So she said she had been kidnapped right off the main street by two guys last night.
She said they took them up to this motel room.
They got them drunk.
And then they raped them.
Well, what has that got to do with me?
You were kind enough to leave a business card.
Yeah.
Well, a lot of people got my business card.
Well, missus, what do you think of old J.R. Ewing now?
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe I'm doing you a favor, huh?
Huh?
You like him any better now knowing what a hotshot lover-boy he is?
Him?
Somebody's gotta take care of the little lady.
Looks like you don't.
Oh, yeah!
Come on, now!
Fight me!
Yes!
Yes!
Fight me.
Go get them, Allen!
Go get them!
- No!
No!
- Fight me!
Yes!
Come on, fight me!
- I'll kill you!
Let go of me!
- You like it?
I got it!
Come on!
You like that?
Thank you, honey.
I enjoyed that.
Will somebody please tell me what's going on down here?
Stay right there, Mama!
Come on, Bobby.
Be sensible.
Let's put up at a motel.
- No, I want to go home.
- What's gotten into you?
- You never used to be so damn stubborn.
- I never used to be a lot of things, Daddy.
If you don't give in, I guess I'll have to.
Let's see if we can give them a hand.
All right.
Okay.
Sit down.
Get some rope.
- We don't have any.
- Find some!
Tie him up.
Why him, not me?
I jumped you too.
Because we need you in the other room, Junior.
- According to you, I was in Waco too.
- Yeah, but with Mary Lou.
She's nobody.
I said, tie him up.
Tighter!
Let's go!
You and your friend better get out of here.
As soon as we get what we came for.
What you came for is gonna be very costly.
This is Jock Ewing's house his family.
- What do you plan to do?
- Same thing as Junior done to my wife.
All right.
Hey, look here.
Well!
So you was once Miss Texas.
You haven't changed that much.
Still a fine-looking woman.
- Ain't she, Luther?
- Oh, yeah.
Say, "Thank you," Miss Texas.
Still got this bathing suit?
No.
But I bet you saved the banner.
Let's go get it.
- I don't know where it is.
- Well, let's go look for it, Miss Texas.
Let's go look for it!
Be right back.
If we don't kill you, Junior, missus might.
Payton, you don't believe that rape story, do you?
Why not?
- Because I don't think you're that dumb.
- Look, I don't care one way or the other.
Junior and the cowboy were with Wanda and Mary Lou last night.
My son and Ray were here last night.
Sorry, Mama.
Sugarplum there told me they just got back from Waco.
Now, that was before I turned into a bad guy.
Right, honey?
Hell, I know how Wanda likes to have a good time.
Chances are she picked him up.
But I gotta protect her.
Luther's calling it rape is what saved my sister's life.
- You talk about justice?
- Nope.
Frick talks about justice.
I talk about having a good time.
Which I intend to here.
Two-for-two justice.
Junior's missus.
And I get to choose.
Ray went with Pam before she married Bobby.
Lucy!
- Grandma, why should I have to...?
- Lucy, you be still!
- That true, beautiful?
- Yeah.
Did pretty good for yourself.
I think I did.
So you was one of us?
- I still am.
- Well, then you're off the hook.
We didn't come here looking for one of us.
We come looking for two of them.
Guess you're elected, sugarplum.
Come on, move!
Come on, Miss Texas, get a move on.
And now here's Miss Texas!
Oh, yeah.
What'd you do for the talent contest, honey?
- What?
- They have talent contests in those beauty shows.
I sang.
Okay, everybody, our former Miss Texas will now sing.
Sing what you sang then, only modern it up.
Sing.
Sing!
Sing!
You're gonna give us a show, Miss Texas.
Or you and I are gonna start our own show.
Luther never has been the shy type.
Stay right there.
I swear I'll shoot.
Now one way or another we're gonna do what we came here to do!
And when we're done, we can leave a house full of people alive or dead!
If I were you, Junior I wouldn't move a muscle.
Now you start singing, sweetheart because I like to be entertained.
Look at this.
Braddock is marked right on the map.
- So what?
- So J.R. Said they were stranded.
- What're you getting at, boy?
Well, it's awful funny they'd be stranded right where they wanted to be.
J.R.'s card.
Move!
Sing.
The coat!
Come on!
I have to give you instructions?
Come on, missus.
A little louder.
Look, I told you.
Oh, God...
Payton, you gonna let him take his justice out on this lady when you told us yourself his Wanda wasn't raped at all?
- You said what?
- I never said nothing like that.
You said she's always looking for a good time.
Looks like she and J.R. Had a lot in common.
Maybe your justice should come from your wife, not J.R.'s.
- God...
- Luther?
We'd better go in the back door.
Well?
Come on!
We ain't done here.
Yeah, we're done.
We're done, Allen.
What you told her about Wanda it's true, ain't it?
- So what?
Allen, it ain't the same.
It ain't the same.
Well, it is for me.
I ain't got what I come for.
- What's going on here, Ray?
- Two dudes with guns in the living room.
Leave her alone!
Payton I'll go with you.
I told you before.
We didn't come for one of our own.
Upstairs, sugarplum.
You let go of her, old woman!
No!
Allen!
- I don't know.
- Yeah?
Well, I know.
Come on!
Don't!
Oh, Grandma!
Get down there!
Somebody better call the sheriff before I blast these two slobs.
No, Jock.
We have to let them go.
Let them go?
Somebody tell me what's going on around here.
Trust me.
We can't involve the law.
All right, get up.
Get up!
If you two punks ever show your face around here again I'll kill you!
Now get out of here!
Me and Wanda got some talking to do, boy.
Now, will somebody tell me what happened here?
Help me get Lucy to bed.
I'll explain.
Granddaddy...
You want to tell me about it?
It's a long story, Bobby.
Are you all right?
Oh, I am now.

[ENGLISH]
In the last episode of Soap,
Dutch and Eunice decided to run away together, since it would be awful to be separated.
Chester still has an awful lot of trouble knowing who he is.
Elaine is no longer being awful, and therefore, Danny and Elaine's relationship is not only no longer awful, but is actually awful nice.
And even though Burt thinks Mary cheated on him with her awful professor and feels awful, he feels more awful that he cheated on her, and the most awful thing about all of this is...
Mary didn't cheat with the awful professor.
Awfully confused?
You won't be after this week's episode of...
Soap.
This is the story of two sisters,
Jessica Tate, and Mary Campbell.
These are the Tates... and these are the Campbells...
And this is Soap.
Don't move or I'll shoot you.
Don't shoot, Mrs. Tate.
It's only me, Dutch.
Oh, good, because I don't have a gun.
But you're in the wrong room.
Eunice's room is down the roof, around the eaves, green organdy curtains.
You can't miss it.
I know.
I came to see you.
You see, Eunice and I are running away together, and I wanted to get your blessing.
I know.
Eunice told me.
You're going to live on a farm.
It's so romantic.
[MUMBLING]
Hello, dear.
Hi.
How you doing?
What the hell are you doing in my wife's bedroom?
Well, I just came by...
I don't care.
Get out.
The both of you.
My wife will drop dead if she sees you in her bed.
Chester, I am your wife.
Is everything okay?
I'm almost ready.
Who is she?
That's Eunice.
Does she belong to you?
Yeah, kind of.
Good.
Then get her out of here.
I'll just go get a few things.
I may not remember anything, but one thing I am pretty sure of... bedrooms are not supposed to be this crowded.
Mrs. Tate?
Yes?
I want you to know that I'll take really good care of Eunice.
I know you're not too thrilled, her running away with a killer, but...
Aw, listen.
I'm married to a killer.
Still, I don't think that this is what you had in mind for your daughter.
Well, I guess not, but...
Dutch, tell me.
Did you really kill a man?
Yeah.
Dead?
You shot him dead?
That's usually what happens in a successful killing.
Of course.
You see, what happened is that when I got out of the Navy,
I borrowed some money to go into business.
The banks all turned me down for a loan, so I went to a local loan company.
They gave me $5000 at a very high rate of interest.
And the first week, when I couldn't come up with the dough, they broke my fingers.
The second week, they broke my nose and two ribs and my knee.
Plus, the guy that was beating me up had a very bad cold, so I ended up with a terrible cough.
The next week, they was gonna break my head, but I convinced them not to.
How?
I talked to them for a while, and then I shot them.
Oh, well, I think that should be considered self-defense.
It was.
But the guy who owned the loan company turned out to be the chief of police.
I'm ready.
Will you take my bags downstairs?
Okay.
You'd better hurry up.
It's getting late.
Okay.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Hmm?
What?
Daddy, I'm leaving, and I wanted to tell you how much I love you.
Oh.
Daddy...
I've been a very lucky girl, and you have been a wonderful father, and I hate leaving you now.
I wish there was something I could do to make things better for you, but I guess there isn't, so I guess all I can do is just let you know how much I love you.
And get well, Daddy, okay?
I love you.
Goodbye.
I want you to know that was a very touching speech, and I'd really be moved if I only knew who you were.
Okay.
Goodbye, Mother.
Goodbye, darling.
I'll write.
I know.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Our little girl.
She's enormous for a little girl.
Chester, what I mean is
I still think of her as a little girl.
Oh.
She must have been a very sweet little girl.
She was.
Adorable.
It's all lost to me.
All of it.
My past, my present, my future.
It's all gone.
I try...
I try so hard to remember, and I can't.
I'm so afraid if I don't remember soon, you'll have me put away.
You've all been so good to me, I...
I must have been some guy to have such a beautiful bunch of people love me the way that you do.
Chester...
It's agony... to know I have a wonderful son and daughters and a wife and not know who they are.
Sometimes, I swear it's almost too much to bear.
Oh, Chester.
I just know it:
someday, you'll remember.
Remember what?
[GASPS]
Jodie.
Hiya, Ma.
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd come up and visit my favorite mother.
How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you?
I'm fine.
You sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Are you sure you're sure?
Jodie.
You're not fine.
Jodie, what is this?
I'm fine.
Ma, I know what you sound like when you're fine, and you have not sounded fine in days.
I'm fine, Jodie.
I think it's got to be one of four things.
You're pregnant.
God forbid.
You're having an affair.
Oh, please.
Menopause.
Not yet.
Burt's having an affair.
Breakfast?
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
Ma, you've got to talk to him.
Oh, I can't.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
Of what?
Being right.
Ma, it's better to know.
No, it's not.
I don't want to know he's sleeping with some young skinny thing.
Maybe he's sleeping with some old fat thing.
Yeah, at home.
Oh, Ma.
Jodie,
I can't compete.
When I was 20, I could compete.
Age has taught me to be philosophical, to accept.
I can't do anything about it, and I accept it.
There's nothing I can do except... hope that whoever she is, wherever she is, someone will drive a knife right through her heart.
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.
If it isn't the bride to be.
Bob, why don't you go sit on a drill?
Listen, Mary, now that Jodie here has moved out anyway,
I see no reason why I can't have his room.
Chuck, that's my sewing room.
That's what I told him.
Your sewing room?
Yeah.
You made my room a sewing room?
Well, what did you expect?
A shrine?
Bob, why don't you go upstairs and watch your feet warp?
Mary, Bob does not need his own room.
Well, I'm certainly tired of living with you.
You've got disgusting personal habits.
You know what he does?
He...
[MUFFLED CHATTERING]
Mary, think about the room, okay?
Good morning, everyone.
Hey, Jessica.
Hmm?
Listen, when I get my own room, maybe you and, uh...
your two friends will come and see me.
Hi, Jess.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
Well, I've been out looking for Chester.
He's been missing since yesterday.
Why didn't you call me?
You must be frantic.
Well, not really.
You see, the other day,
Chester said he needed his net stockings.
He thinks he's Marlene Dietrich.
And net stockings in his size may be very hard to find, Mary.
He could be gone for days.
I know a place where he...
[CLEARS THROAT]
Coffee, Jess?
Yes, please.
Well, Jodie.
So you're going to get married, huh?
Yeah, it, uh...
looks that way.
Isn't that nice.
Yeah.
I guess that means you're not gay.
No, Aunt Jessica.
It doesn't.
Hmm.
You know, Jodie, when we were younger, there was no such thing as homosexuals.
Yes, there were, Aunt Jessica.
The homosexuals go way back in history.
Who?
Alexander the Great was gay.
Uh, Plato was gay.
Plato?
Mickey Mouse's dog was gay?
Aunt Jessica, would you be very offended if I didn't continue this conversation?
Not at all.
Oh, Mary.
Yes?
What, Jess?
Id-day ou-yay ask-ay urt-Bay about his affair-ay?
What?
Did you ask Burt about his affair-ay?
No.
Listen, I know you two mean to be helpful, but it's my marriage, and I have to handle this my own way.
You're right, Mary.
You're absolutely right.
Mickey Mouse had a gay dog?
You didn't know?
First I heard of it.
Yeah.
Goofy was his lover.
And so, uh, Sally, I...
I've been doing a lot of thinking, and...
Well, what I'm trying to say is...
Sally, you're a terrific girl, but... it's over.
You and me.
Us.
Over.
Sorry.
I can't do it, Sal.
It's making me a nervous wreck.
Look at me.
I put on two different shoes this morning.
Sally, you... you'll get over this really very soon.
You'll see.
Really.
I mean, after all, we were together only one night, and I can't even remember the night.
Of course, it's different with you.
You were more involved.
You were conscious at the time.
Still, I mean... what we're talking about here is a... maybe a 25-minute involvement.
Sally, talk to me, please.
Make this a little easier here.
Say something.
You told me you loved me.
Say something else.
You said we'd go away.
What?
To Aruba.
Aruba?
I never heard of it.
It sounds like a rash.
You promised.
Maybe you got me confused with somebody else.
You know, I bet right now, there's some guy sitting in Aruba Airlines wondering where the hell you are.
You made plans.
And now you tell me it's over, after all that?
If all I was to you, Burt, was a one-night stand, you never had to say all those things that you said.
Sally, uh, are you crying?
[WAILS]
I guess...
I guess...
Sally, please, don't cry.
I feel so awful.
I feel so cheap and dirty and awful.
I...
I wish I were dead.
Come on, not dead.
That's just a terrible thing to wish, "dead."
Sally.
Don't be silly, Sally.
I do.
I wish I were dead.
No, no.
Take it easy.
Come, sit down.
Sally...
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Breathe in.
How about a cup of coffee?
Please.
Listen, um...
Sally, um...
You're more than a one-night stand, okay?
Really.
And I would never do that to you.
Never.
So just forget everything I said.
Maybe I was a little too hasty.
Maybe I didn't think things through, and, uh...
So forget what I said and then take it easy.
It's not over?
No, it's not over.
You know...
Let's sleep on it, okay?
Okay.
[SAUCY VOICE] Together?
Together.
Oh, what a joker you are.
[MUMBLES] Say, I'm going to...
You clean up this stuff, and I'm just going to...
It's working.
Give me a few more weeks.
He'll be a broken man.
Come on, Ma.
Sit down.
I made some tea.
Oh, thank you, Corinne.
That's very nice of you.
Don't worry, Ma.
Daddy just forgot where the house is, that's all.
No, Corinne.
I don't think so.
He's left.
Oh, why would he leave?
Because he knew.
He knew he couldn't remember, and he felt terrible, and I didn't know how terrible he felt until last night, and now I feel terrible because I didn't know, but I mean, what could I do?
I didn't know, and now he's left.
We're back.
Nothing.
We covered the parks, the stores, and all the movie theaters.
Nothing.
But there's this movie theater downtown called the Peekaboo.
You can't believe what's playing there.
Yeah.
And he made me wait outside.
All the other theaters, we were in and out of in two minutes.
We get to the Peekaboo, He made me wait outside, and he doesn't come out for half an hour.
It was very dark in there.
I couldn't see.
I saw things you wouldn't believe.
Benson, did you have any luck?
Sort of.
I didn't find him.
Did the police get here yet?
No, not yet.
Mm.
Where's the major?
Ah, he's not here.
Where is he?
Out.
You let him out?
Well, Benson, he wanted to help look, and we thought it would be a good idea since he and Chester think a lot alike these days.
Ah, wonderful.
Now I've got two gumballs to look for.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
You want me to get that?
If you don't mind.
Evening.
Evening.
I'm Deputy Gilmore.
You reported a missing person?
Yes, officer.
My husband.
Name?
Jessica Tate.
Funny name for a man.
No, I'm Jessica.
He's Chester.
Chester...
Tate.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Bobby Gilmore?
Yeah.
Bobby "The Chicken" Gilmore?
No!
Yeah.
Benson!
I don't believe it.
It's Benson.
This is Benson.
We know.
Last time I saw you, you were 8 years old.
You've changed.
Benson, I don't believe it.
Yeah.
You, of all people...
The biggest coward in the neighborhood.
Yeah, they used to call him "The Chicken."
Now you're a cop.
That sure makes me feel secure.
Benson.
How about that?
It's Benson.
I know.
Uh, Deputy Chicken... if you don't mind...
Please, about my husband...
Oh, I'm very, very sorry.
Um, missing.
Answers to the name of Chester Tate.
Also "Colonel Tate."
A colonel.
No.
He thought he was.
And now he doesn't?
We don't know.
He might.
I see.
He also answers to the name of "Marlene Dietrich."
And "Gloria Swanson."
I hope they're paying you well... because you got a job on your hands.
Also "Gunga Din."
Huh.
Gunga Din.
Ah, let me see if I've got this right.
Chester Tate, alias Colonel Tate, alias Marlene Dietrich, alias Gloria Swanson, alias Gunga Din.
And, uh, while you're looking for the colonel, you might as well look for the major.
Major?
Is this a real major or a "sometime" major, like the colonel?
He's a real major.
I see.
But not anymore.
Gotcha.
This is a zoo.
You ought to see them eat.
So we're looking for a colonel, who may or may not be a colonel, and a major who used to be a major.
Is that right?
Right.
Damn beast.
I gave him the colonel's shirt.
I gave him the colonel's socks.
You'd think from socks he'd catch the scent.
He took me to the river, and he wouldn't budge.
You lost the scent.
Sigmund, heel.
Pick up your feet.
Now you've only got the colonel to look for.
Is he as bad as the major?
Just about.
You sure you want me to look for him?
Take your time.
Do you think we're normal?
What do you mean, do I think we're normal?
We make love all the time.
We don't make love all the time.
Oh, yes, we do.
At least every night.
Do you think other couples make love that much?
I don't know.
You want to take a poll?
Okay.
[SIGHS]
Hey.
"Hey" what?
What are you going to do right now?
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, are you going to go to sleep or what?
What do you got in mind?
You want to?
Again?
You don't want to?
I want to.
I want to.
[GIGGLES]
I'll be right back.
We are not normal.
We are definitely not normal.
But who wants to be normal?
Thank you, God.
In the last few weeks, you have made me happier than in my whole life.
You're really okay.
[GIGGLING] Oh, Danny.
Oh, you letch.
What is this, your idea of kinky?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Elaine, if you don't want to, all you have to do is say so.
You don't have to hide.
Oh, my God.

And this is Soap.
Don't move or I'll shoot you.
Don't shoot, Mrs. Tate.
It's only me, Dutch.
Oh, good, because I don't have a gun.
But you're in the wrong room.
Eunice's room is down the roof, around the eaves, green organdy curtains.

Hello, dear.
Hi.
How you doing?
What the hell are you doing in my wife's bedroom?
Well, I just came by...
I don't care.
Get out.
The both of you.
My wife will drop dead if she sees you in her bed.
Chester, I am your wife.
Is everything okay?
I'm almost ready.
Who is she?
That's Eunice.
Does she belong to you?
Yeah, kind of.
Good.
Then get her out of here.
I'll just go get a few things.
I may not remember anything, but one thing I am pretty sure of... bedrooms are not supposed to be this crowded.
Mrs. Tate?
Yes?
I want you to know that I'll take really good care of Eunice.
I know you're not too thrilled, her running away with a killer, but...
Aw, listen.
I'm married to a killer.
Still, I don't think that this is what you had in mind for your daughter.
Well, I guess not, but...
Dutch, tell me.
Did you really kill a man?
Yeah.
Dead?
You shot him dead?
That's usually what happens in a successful killing.
Of course.
You see, what happened is that when I got out of the Navy,

Hiya, Ma.
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd come up and visit my favorite mother.
How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you?
I'm fine.
You sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Are you sure you're sure?
Jodie.
You're not fine.
Jodie, what is this?
I'm fine.

Burt's having an affair.
Breakfast?

Pretty sure.
Ma, you've got to talk to him.
Oh, I can't.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
Of what?

No, it's not.
I don't want to know he's sleeping with some young skinny thing.

your two friends will come and see me.
Hi, Jess.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
Well, I've been out looking for Chester.
He's been missing since yesterday.
Why didn't you call me?
You must be frantic.
Well, not really.
You see, the other day,
Chester said he needed his net stockings.
He thinks he's Marlene Dietrich.
And net stockings in his size may be very hard to find, Mary.
He could be gone for days.
I know a place where he...
Coffee, Jess?
Yes, please.
Well, Jodie.
So you're going to get married, huh?
Yeah, it, uh...
looks that way.
Isn't that nice.
Yeah.
I guess that means you're not gay.
No, Aunt Jessica.
It doesn't.

You and me.
Us.
Over.
Sorry.
I can't do it, Sal.
It's making me a nervous wreck.
Look at me.
I put on two different shoes this morning.

I feel so cheap and dirty and awful.

I wish I were dead.
Come on, not dead.
That's just a terrible thing to wish, "dead."
Sally.
Don't be silly, Sally.
I do.
I wish I were dead.
No, no.
Take it easy.
Come, sit down.

So just forget everything I said.
Maybe I was a little too hasty.
Maybe I didn't think things through, and, uh...
So forget what I said and then take it easy.
It's not over?
No, it's not over.
You know...
Let's sleep on it, okay?
Okay.
Together?
Together.
Oh, what a joker you are.
Say, I'm going to...
You clean up this stuff, and I'm just going to...
It's working.
Give me a few more weeks.
He'll be a broken man.
Come on, Ma.
Sit down.
I made some tea.
Oh, thank you, Corinne.
That's very nice of you.
Don't worry, Ma.
Daddy just forgot where the house is, that's all.
No, Corinne.
I don't think so.
He's left.
Oh, why would he leave?
Because he knew.
He knew he couldn't remember, and he felt terrible, and I didn't know how terrible he felt until last night, and now I feel terrible because I didn't know, but I mean, what could I do?
I didn't know, and now he's left.
We're back.
Nothing.
We covered the parks, the stores, and all the movie theaters.
Nothing.
But there's this movie theater downtown called the Peekaboo.
You can't believe what's playing there.
Yeah.
And he made me wait outside.
All the other theaters, we were in and out of in two minutes.
We get to the Peekaboo, He made me wait outside, and he doesn't come out for half an hour.
It was very dark in there.
I couldn't see.
I saw things you wouldn't believe.
Benson, did you have any luck?
Sort of.
I didn't find him.
Did the police get here yet?
No, not yet.
Mm.
Where's the major?
Ah, he's not here.
Where is he?
Out.
You let him out?
Well, Benson, he wanted to help look, and we thought it would be a good idea since he and Chester think a lot alike these days.
Ah, wonderful.
Now I've got two gumballs to look for.
You want me to get that?
If you don't mind.
Evening.
Evening.
I'm Deputy Gilmore.
You reported a missing person?
Yes, officer.
My husband.
Name?
Jessica Tate.
Funny name for a man.
No, I'm Jessica.
He's Chester.
Chester...
Tate.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Bobby Gilmore?
Yeah.
Bobby "The Chicken" Gilmore?
No!
Yeah.
Benson!
I don't believe it.
It's Benson.
This is Benson.
We know.
Last time I saw you, you were 8 years old.
You've changed.
Benson, I don't believe it.
Yeah.
You, of all people...
The biggest coward in the neighborhood.
Yeah, they used to call him "The Chicken."
Now you're a cop.
That sure makes me feel secure.
Benson.
How about that?
It's Benson.
I know.
Uh, Deputy Chicken... if you don't mind...
Please, about my husband...
Oh, I'm very, very sorry.
Um, missing.
Answers to the name of Chester Tate.
Also "Colonel Tate."
A colonel.
No.
He thought he was.
And now he doesn't?
We don't know.
He might.
I see.
He also answers to the name of "Marlene Dietrich."
And "Gloria Swanson."
I hope they're paying you well... because you got a job on your hands.
Also "Gunga Din."
Huh.
Gunga Din.
Ah, let me see if I've got this right.
Chester Tate, alias Colonel Tate, alias Marlene Dietrich, alias Gloria Swanson, alias Gunga Din.
And, uh, while you're looking for the colonel, you might as well look for the major.
Major?
Is this a real major or a "sometime" major, like the colonel?
He's a real major.
I see.
But not anymore.
Gotcha.
This is a zoo.
You ought to see them eat.
So we're looking for a colonel, who may or may not be a colonel, and a major who used to be a major.
Is that right?
Right.
Damn beast.
I gave him the colonel's shirt.
I gave him the colonel's socks.
You'd think from socks he'd catch the scent.
He took me to the river, and he wouldn't budge.
You lost the scent.
Sigmund, heel.
Pick up your feet.
Now you've only got the colonel to look for.
Is he as bad as the major?
Just about.
You sure you want me to look for him?
Take your time.
Do you think we're normal?
What do you mean, do I think we're normal?
We make love all the time.
We don't make love all the time.
Oh, yes, we do.
At least every night.
Do you think other couples make love that much?
I don't know.
You want to take a poll?
Okay.
Hey.
"Hey" what?
What are you going to do right now?
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, are you going to go to sleep or what?
What do you got in mind?
You want to?
Again?
You don't want to?
I want to.
I want to.
I'll be right back.
We are not normal.
We are definitely not normal.
But who wants to be normal?
Thank you, God.
In the last few weeks, you have made me happier than in my whole life.
You're really okay.
Oh, Danny.
Oh, you letch.
What is this, your idea of kinky?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Elaine, if you don't want to, all you have to do is say so.
You don't have to hide.
Oh, my God.
Will Dutch and Eunice find happiness on a farm?
Or will the police find them first?
Will Mary tell Burt she's found out about his affair?
Will Burt find out Mary didn't have the affair he thought he had found her in?
Will Burt find a way to get rid of Sally?
Or will she find a way to destroy him?
Will Chester be found?
Does he want to be found?
Who wants to find him?
Will Danny find out who kidnapped Elaine?
And will they find her?
Find out the answers to these questions and many others on the next episode of...
Soap.
Soap is videotaped before a studio audience.
No, no, sorry.
Lay your arm here
And your head like this.
Move a little.
Hi.
That's enough for today girls.
So why did you come?
A shower.
I can see, you need it.
You disappeared for three months and now you come back... for a shower!
I don't know... does it seem normal to you uh?
Yes.
You're an asshole.
You could leave a message...
you could give me a call
To show your good manners at least.
What are good manners?
You never knew, didn't you?
No.
I never cared.
Who's her?
A girl.
She attends the academy.
She's way too different from you.
Yeah okay.
But I'm sure she fucks like every other girl.
What do you to say about it?
What do I have to say?
You didn't change, you're the habitual jerk.
And you like jerks...
don't you sweet Veronique?
You like crackpots.
You like those who go against the grain.
You like spineless people, those who don't want and cannot do anything...
The amoral, the outcasts.
It was your choice to live like this!
No, it happened by chance.
And the others, those like you, convinced me to remain as I am.
Those who hang out with me and want to save me.
The moralists, the honest people, the sympathetic people.
Those who think that it is society's fault
Because I am a nice guy after all, I still can hope for salvation
And while they say this they strip me and then they go to bed with me.
But there they stay silent and I lead the game.
And you became so good that you made a profession out of it.
Look if you want a job we can speak about it.
You were a good model.
I have a job already and that's enough for me at the moment.
Alright.
Anyway, if you need me, you know where to look for.
Yes?
I'm coming.
Wait a minute.
That's him.
Yes.
Is it permitted to say hello to an artist?
The show is very funny...
and you are great!
You bet.
Tonight that fool hit me for real.
Well... you didn't pull punches too.
The audience wants it: sex and violence.
...That's the drama of our century.
And now excuse me, but I have to prepare for the next show.
You are a truly devoted artist!
...Anyway I need you for some work.
Forget it.
Five hundred dollars.
Does it interest you?
So, we're not dealing with photos!
Good morning sir!
You're welcome, I'm advising the lady.
Hi.
So, do you like my home?
Not bad!
My husband is a very important man.
And if the old man is so rich why do you work?
Listen, show some respect.
It's hard for me, considering what you asked me.
Carlo, I'm not paying you to judge.
Paul is a wonderful man.
He took me away from the cesspool in which I lived to give me back dignity!
Ok, that's enough, you moved me deeply.
Would you introduce your friend to me, Veronique?
Miss Charlotte, what a surprise!
Good morning, Edward, you look in great shape!
You know, I was passing by and...
Hi.
Charlotte, oh dear, what a pleasure to see you!
Good morning, Veronique.
Dad's home?
He should be in his studio.
If you step by tomorrow, the photos should be ready.
Alright.
You know, he's a model, he poses for me from time to time.
I'm going to see dad.
So it's not the way you told me!
What do you mean?
You told me she was a random girl, but she's your daughter instead.
No, she's Paul's daughter.
...Her mother died when she was young and she became attached to her father even more.
And when I and Paul got married, Charlotte decided to live alone.
We have a good relationship, as you saw.
But she's a very independent girl.
Uhm, excuse me, but why are you so interested?
No, uhm, no.
She doesn't interest me at all.
And what does she do in her life?
She studies... she is currently attending the last year at art college.
She works as an art model to make a living.
She posed for me too.
She lives in an apartment in the midtown but I don't even know where, exactly.
But why does she interest you so much?
Just curiosity... you told me she was an ordinary girl.
Steer clear of her in any way.
But it's just a curiosity, I told you!
That's too much for a curiosity.
I don't even know why I'm telling you all these things.
Let's change subject.
Ok, as you want.
Is she virgin?
Stop it!
But for who do you worry so much?
For her or for me?
Anyway, don't worry, cultured chicks are not my kind of woman.
What do you do tonight?
Work?
No.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
It's my day of rest and I do not intend to work overtime!
Asshole!
In a particular object we can distinguish various properties like color, smell Get a sense of its real concreteness and connect it to a formal circumstance...
So that an object is defined "soft" inasmuch in some way...
Hi.
Do you often come here?
No, just when I have to eat.
Hello.
Seeing that you were late, I have already eaten.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Did we have an appointment?
You knew I would have come.
Were you waiting for me?
No... yes!
What's your name?
Carlo.
My name is...
Charlotte.
I know everything about you, almost everything.
Who told you?
Veronique?
Yes.
She photographed me sometimes.
I know that!
We met at the mansion, do you remember?
And so... have you got some ideas?
What shall we do?
Come with me.
I don't want to sleep tonight.
How cute!
Watch!
How beautiful!
So funny!
Watch that one with that nose!
Ah that one!
It's all closed here.
No it's not all closed, I tell you.
Don't you see how much people around here, uh?
Listen!
I remember that when I was a child I wanted at all costs to come here...
My father used to tell me that this place was closed but I wanted to come here anyway.
So I started to imagine this place full of colors, people, kids having fun...
do you get it?
I always visit this place when it's closed!
Come with me, let's see the dollhouse!
Why did you enlarge this photo?
Which photo?
The one in which I'm snuggled.
Don't you like it?
No, I look like a satyr.
But you are a satyr!
It's not true.
So you think you know me well, uh?
Well, I don't know, I don't care at all.
I see you like this.
What are you doing here?
I need money.
I can work as a model for you, if you're interested.
Don't tell me you got fired!
How so?
You did not perform well?
It never happened to me in my whole life.
The money I earn is not enough, I want more.
I need more money.
You're becoming a bourgeois... "I need more money" is a phrase you didn't know.
You wouldn't even think about it some time ago, you didn't need anything.
I remember that you used to lose money, and now I don't understand why you need it.
Because I want to rent a flat, some piece of furniture, linen, everything I need for a house.
What are you saying?
You always lived in a hotel!
I changed my mind.
Is she younger than me?
You're wonderful.
I like your perfume.
It's the same perfume as always.
Are you in love with her?
What do you say?
Yes, I know it's a silly word, but I can't find another one.
And you?
Are you in love with me?
And you?
No.
Alright.
Tell me something about her!
I asked you, if she's younger than me.
She could be your daughter.
Congratulations!
What's her name?
Charlotte.
You bastard!
You dirty swine!
I told you to stay away from her!
Charlotte is not for you!
Get it?
I love her.
It's the first time in my life.
Who do you think you're kidding?
You just want her father's money!
You hope to get settled, to live like a sir after years and years in the dirt!
Stop it!
Did you tell her who you are?
How do you make a living?
Did you tell her how much you're dirty?
Shut up!
Bitch!
Would you lend me your bicycle?
Yes.
Hey, you said yes!
Well it's not mine.
I met her in the center of town and accompanied her here.
So I can take it.
No, no, let me ask her first.
Ok, she said yes.
Hey, listen, has she got a name?
Sure...
Tandem!
Thank you!
Come on Charlotte, pedal!
Don't be lazy!
But I'm not lazy!
Who knows me can tell you.
Listen, I want to know you better!
I want to know more.
Who are you Carlo?
I mean, as a person.
The story of my life is like Hop-o'
- My-Thumb's tale.
What does it mean?
Do you know it?
Yes.
I'm like Hop-o'
- My-Thumb.
My wood was the city.
Every city I visited.
I always told myself:
If something goes wrong, I'll go back...
Back to my town, to my garden.
But the reality of life is different from Hop-o'
- My-Thumb's tale.
There was a moment in which I seriously thought to come back.
But maybe I wouldn't have found any pebbles.
Or I wouldn't even wanted to look for them perhaps.
So I prefer to go straight ahead anyway.
It's a very sad story.
Why?
Who just goes ahead randomly doesn't know where he's going to.
Going on this way, without ever stopping, without ever building anything, you're just rushing to death.
Yet, who acts like this is searching for something.
And maybe I found it.
Do you think she's the right one?
Goodbye, goodbye!
Don't you miss your friends?
Why?
I feel good with you.
Well, they're different.
They've got a lot of subjects.
I haven't studied much.
You know, you've got a very important quality that you shouldn't underestimate.
You are never boring.
Do you like me just for that?
No, I like you because you're different.
Maybe it's because you're Italian, there's something that pleases me and gives me a feeling of protection.
And sometimes you need this warmth.
You have so many things that wait to be understood.
But you have to make the first effort.
Would you come to see a show tonight?
A comedy?
Yes, sort of.
It's part of the things to understand.
I'm coming gladly!
Now you know who I am.
The alternative to this was an ordinary monotonous work A bleak existence... maybe hunger.
All things considered, I have fun.
No, it's not true, I don't believe it.
That's what it is.
I enjoy so much seeing those hypocrites' faces!
Those impotents' that watch me, frothing at the mouth!
Enough!
Wait I haven't finished!
I enjoy watching people that togs respectability daily, that goes to church on Sunday and when it's dark in the night, covertly, comes to see me doing what they can't do anymore because they're impotent, each of them!
Enough!
Where are you going, where are you going, Charlotte?
Charlotte!
I can't do anything else!
I never tried, but I'm sure I can't do anything else!
And I'm good!
Yes, I have to be good!
I hear the applauses!
I am like a star.
Yes.
A star...
You see...
I love you, Carlo.
I love you, too.
Come.
I'll bring you home.
So, now she knows everything.
You're the most abject being I've ever met.
If there's something of which I don't care at all, it's the insults.
I collect them from the day I was born.
I know, but let me talk with her and, you'll see, she'll despise you!
And what will you tell her?
Will you tell her that I'm your mattress, other than your model?
Or will you tell her that I've been paid with her father's money to fuck you?
You pig!
Pigs, Veronique, pigs...
don't leave me alone now.
So how much do you want, so as to leave her alone?
That always is the last ace up your sleeve, isn't it?
I said, how much do you want?
I want Charlotte.
I want her in exchange of all the filthiness I had to swallow All the fetid greasy bodies I had to caress.
I want her youth, her sweetness, the purity of her gaze, her tenderness.
I want all of this because I have the right!
You gave me enough money.
Now I don't know what to do with it.
Carlo are you ready?
Excuse me, I didn't know you weren't alone.
Hurry up, it's our turn now.
You will only hurt her.
Better let it go, the figure of the mother doesn't fit you well.
What a coward.
You are wonderful.
Now that I don't perform at Piccadilly anymore, I have to find a job a home.
It seems a good idea to me.
We should buy an attic in the Old Town with a window on the roof.
Yes, I feel the need for it.
Why?
Well, so as to have a home all for us...
you know, Carlo, every night when we say goodbye I'm afraid I'll lose you.
You're right, we should live together and get married, maybe.
Do you agree?
Would you marry me?
Of course... given that we have decided to live together, it doesn't look like a strange idea to me...
But why should we definitely get married?
You are the most authentic thing I ever had.
I want to marry you for this reason, because I'm afraid I will lose you.
Uh, I know this.
If we get married, all of this will assume a meaning... it's like a promise.
But it has a meaning for an entire life!
And wouldn't you give all of yourself for all your life, now?
Yes, I decided before, in the wood.
Thank you.
You were about to tell me you are Spanish.
No, I'm Italian.
Ah, Rome!
What a splendor!
Gretel!
Gretel!
I'm Venetian, actually, I'm from Rovigo.
Ah Rovigo!
How beatiful!
I remember...
once in Rovigo...
What a beautiful city.
If you say so.
No, it wasn't Rovigo.
Who the fuck are these people?
Paul's sister, ex opera singer.
And who is he?
Paul's brother with his wife...
you could spare this farce.
It was Charlotte.
She wanted me to know her family.
I forgot you're engaged.
Asshole.
How is it going with the study, Charlotte?
Very well, but I have to stop for a while, sadly.
Why?
I and Carlo have decided to have a journey together.
A journey?
Yes... a honeymoon trip!
We have decided to get married!
Congratulations!
What good news!
Who would have ever thought, little Charlotte getting married!
I remember when you were small like this!
Bravo!
What a beautiful couple!
All the best and may you be blest with many children!
What good news... joy to everybody!
We have to party!
Oh yes!
It's time for a round of drinks!
I didn't know you were at this point... are you sure Charlotte?
Yes I thought much about it dad.
I can see.
I trust my daughter very much.
Yes, it's true, I always admired Paul for his good principles and his high sense of family!
What is your job?
I don't work at the moment.
I left my old job forever.
Did you get fired?
No, not nearly, madam, they wanted to raise my salary but I chose to leave.
I was very appreciated... by everybody.
I asked you because I love Charlotte.
I love her too.
To the bride and the groom!
All the best!
Congratulations!
You are such a beautiful couple!
No, stop it.
Why?
What's up?
I don't understand.
It never happened to me.
Excuse me.
Carlo, stop it, someone is watching us!
Well...
let him watch!
No no.
Let's go away!
Let's go.
Stop.
You have come.
Where?
To the date with love.
Twenty thousand and...
So, it's okay?
No, excuse me... maybe next time.
So you'll return!
Yes, Carlo...
Yes, Carlo, yes...
Hi.
Hope you haven't had breakfast.
No.
Shall we go down and eat something?
I'm not in the mood.
I'd say you need it.
I'm not hungry.
As you prefer, it doesn't matter.
You promised to bring me to the Vatican Museums today, do you remember?
I remember, but I'm not feeling well.
Shall I call a doctor?
I just want to be alone.
Alright.
Charlotte!
Yes, Carlo.
Darling, don't ever talk to me like this...
I love you!
Stay silent, I beg you.
I love you, whatever you have.
Alright... don't talk about it anymore.
Listen, how about returning home?
I'd say it is rather difficult, considering we haven't got a home yet.
What happened?
There was someone, I remember.
What do you say?
He got off at the last stop.
Welcome, Ms. Charlotte.
Thanks.
Is dad home?
He's in the living room.
Dad!
I'm here.
Hi, Charlotte!
Hello!
Dear... when did you arrive?
This morning.
Did you like Rome?
Yes it's an amazing city... it's wonderful.
Fountains, streets, even crowds.
If you don't leave hastily, you risk to stay forever there.
And... where is your husband?
He went looking for a flat.
Ah.
You know...
I think he's found the home I always desired.
Good.
Here's the toilet, the bedroom...
and this is the living room.
We can place a small bookcase here uh?
Yes sure.
And here the studio... this is a bright ambiance isn't it?
Here the table, a shelf, the tripod... two pictures there...
If you want to add something...
I don't know...
We could add a television, so we know what to do in the night at least.
Not bad, as a joke.
It was a joke but not I didn't mean what you think.
Anyway, since we're on the subject, it would be better if we talk about it.
No...
I'm not in the mood, right now.
Let's talk about it instead, or, otherwise, we'll risk to give it more importance that it actually has.
Do you think it isn't important?
I just think that we should go to the doctor.
Why don't we go to an orthopaedist?
So I put it into plaster cast!
Carlo, you know what?
I don't care about the television!
I was joking!
Listen, if we arrive first, what do we win?
Please, wait a moment!
You are not forced to follow me!
I go on my fucking own, get it?
What?
Didn't the priest say:
The wife will follow her husband everywhere he goes?
Don't you remember?
He didn't mean this.
Oh yes!
He also said:
She will tolerate with love and patience, bad manners and vulgarity!
What are you doing?
Be careful!
What a stupid.
I almost needed an orthopaedist, too!
Did you get hurt?
No... changing subject:
I made some calculations and we're running out of money.
So, starting from tomorrow we have to fast!
Very good, we'll be on diet!
There isn't anything to laugh over!
I'll get back to modeling for the academy.
And I'll get back to porn exhibitions!
Never!
Anyway, Veronique is preparing a show... we could work as models for her.
Get down on your knees.
Kiss each other.
Stop it!
Charlotte!
I'm sorry, but I don't know how I can help you.
I just wanted to vent to someone.
Charlotte you know that, from the very first beginning, I never had a soft spot for him.
...And I foresaw a period of difficulty, I guarantee you.
But now you caught me by surprise.
You see, sex for me is not much relevant.
Well, you never had this sort of problems.
No normal person has got these problems.
But Carlo is sane!
Sane?
Do you think that a person that shows his sexual qualities on a stage on front of hundreds of people is sane?
So you knew about him!
Yes...
But I thought that speaking about that with you wasn't the appropriate thing to do, you knew it too.
On the other hand, the figure of the moralist doesn't suit me well.
And anyway, what could I suggest to you?
You decided to err all alone a long time ago.
Yes, but, you see, Carlo is...
Carlo is rotten in the head.
And he's a man unable to have a common sexual intercourse, furthermore.
That's just a mental block!
Something that any book of psychology can explain abundantly.
Religion is much more synthetic on this subject.
It defines that "divine punishment".
Stop!
Excuse me, dad.
You say this to me, you, who never believed in God.
It's true, Charlotte, I never believed in God, but I believe in mankind.
And I believe in the beast that lives inside of men.
In the ferocious struggle that man conducts in order to live, he is alone.
And, in this loneliness, he is in some aspects like God.
You see, Carlo...
let's give him some time.
How's the house doing?
Ah, it's so beautiful.
I would have liked to help you, at least with the furniture.
Thank you, dad, but we prefer to do everything alone...
Carlo is very proud and he wouldn't ever accept to be helped.
Indeed.
So... what do you think?
Do you like them?
Did you invite me just for this?
I wanted your opinion.
And?
Don't know, have a drink, chat a little, like two good friends, nothing more.
Alright, but... hurry up.
You didn't change at all, after your marriage.
You're the same yokel as always.
Not even Charlotte changed your mind.
What does Charlotte have to do with this?
I was wondering how she can be always in shape, even if she has to satisfy a stallion like you.
It's our business.
Well, I'm a member of your family, by now... is she good in bed?
Do I stimulate you, if I talk about it?
Carlo, why do you despise me so much?
Because you're a whore.
And yet, you liked me some time ago.
That's not exact, I liked your money.
I still can give you some money, even more if you want.
In order to be in bed with you... and my father-in-law?
He didn't ask me, actually, but he gave me a hint.
But you don't have the guts to sink so low.
You do have the guts, don't you?
I take what I want.
Look for someone else.
Charlotte will have to look for someone else, too.
She came to see me the day you came back and she told me everything
She cried desperately, obsessed by the thought that you don't like her,
But I know it's not like that.
You love her, don't you?
You are able to give anything to possess her because the first time you tried, you didn't get it up.
What?
Come on, don't pretend you didn't understand,
You can't have a normal sexual intercourse by now.
You are sick... you need someone else to get excited,
Like a fisherman, or the man on the train...
That's not true.
You need someone that watches you, even Charlotte noticed that.
Maybe she's naive, but she's not stupid.
This is not true.
Yes, that's true!
While I was there taking photos of you two you got excited just because I was there watching you!
Stop it.
You will never possess her.
Because she won't play along with you.
Don't you get it?
You would only disgust her!
Why don't you accept the trade?
Listen to me:
I'll make another photographic service.
Then I'll pretend to go away and leave you alone.
You are disgusting.
Don't be stupid, she won't ever notice!
You won't ever have her!
Ever!
Because you are corrupt!
Carlo!
Hey, what are you doing at this time of day?
I was searching for a husband.
You don't like the one you have?
No, because he's not a kid anymore, but he still believes in the tooth fairy.
Where were you?
When I came back home and found you weren't there, I got scared.
I followed your piece of advice, I went to the doctor.
It seems everything is alright.
It's just some sort of nervous breakdown.
It will get better.
Like I told you.
Yes...
Let's go home!
No, I don't want to sleep tonight.
Come, I want to spend the night at the amusement park, waiting for the dawn with you...
like the first time.
Charlotte.
Yes, Carlo.
You won, I'm at your beck and call.
When?
This afternoon.
Hello.
Hello Ms. Is everything ok?
What are you doing here?
There's a strike today, nobody told you?
It's for the last ministerial circular.
Oh, the same old story.
Give me a cigarette come on.
Alright...
I have to go, goodbye everybody.
Bye!
Bye!
See you soon.
Taxi!
Edward... dad...
Is anybody there?
Dad!
Hello?
How are you?
I'm fine.
I'm sorry for what happened.
Paul wanted this for the good of Charlotte.
He wanted to take her away from you, even sacrificing himself.
Carlo, I swear, I didn't know anything...
I love you.
Everything must return to how it was before.
Or do you hope she will come back?
If she returns, it would mean that she's accepted all this filth.
So I hope she won't come back.
Maybe it is better this way...
and what will you do now?
Try to guess...
What's happening?
Go away.
Teacher.
I see your talents have gone beyond the mere physical level.
Your skills are now at the point of spiritual insight.
I have questions: what is the highest technique you hope to achieve?
-To have no technique.
-Very good.
What are your thoughts when facing an opponent?
There is no opponent.
And why is that?
Because the word "I" does not exist.
So.
Continue.
A good fight should be...
... likeasmallplay ,butplayedseriously.
A good martial artist does not become tense, but ready.
Not thinking, yet not dreaming.
Ready for whatever may come.
When the opponent expand, I contract.
When he contracts, I expand.
And when there is an opportunity...
... I donothit .
It hits all by itself.
Now, you must remember...
... theenemyhasonlyimages and illusions...
... behindwhichhehideshistruemotives .
Destroy the image and you will break the enemy.
The "it" that you refer to is a powerful weapon...
... easilymisusedby themartialartist who deserts his vows.
For centuries now, the code of the Shaolin Temple has been preserved.
Remember, the honor of our brotherhood has been held true.
Tell me now the Shaolin commandment number 1 3.
"A martial artist has to take responsibility for himself...
... andaccepttheconsequences of his own doing."
I'm ashamed to tell you now...
... amongalltheShaolinmen I have taught...
... thereisonewho has turned the ways of knowledge and strength...
... tohisownbaseends .
He has perverted all we hold sacred.
His name is Han.
In defiance of all our beliefs...
... hehasbroughtdisgrace to the Shaolin Temple.
So it is now for you to reclaim our lost honor.
Yes.
I understand.
There is a man here.
You will go to him.
Hello, Mr. Lee.
My name's Braithwaite.
Hello, Mr. Braithwaite.
I've come to speak to you about a matter of great importance.
-Have some tea?
-Yes, indeed.
This is very pleasant.
Mr. Lee, I've come to speak to you about a tournament of martial arts.
A tournament to which you've received an invitation.
Specifically, a tournament organized by Mr. Han.
-Han's tournament.
-I know, I know, I know.
But we'd very much like you to attend that particular tournament, Mr. Lee.
"We," Mr. Braithwaite?
It's Lao's time.
Yes, of course.
Kick me.
What was that?
An exhibition?
We need emotional content.
Try again.
I said, emotional content, not anger.
Now, try again.
With me.
That's it.
How did it feel to you?
Let me think... .
Don't think.
Feel.
It is like a finger pointing a way to the moon.
Don't concentrate on the finger...
... oryouwillmissallthatheavenlyglory.
Do you understand?
Never take your eyes off your opponent, even when you bow.
That's it.
There.
That's Han.
That's the only film we have on him.
We know he was a member of your temple.
A Shaolin monk, now a renegade.
That's Oharra behind him.
Personal bodyguard.
Tough, ruthless, as you might expect, being Han's bodyguard.
We got our hands on a demonstration film of Oharra.
All real bricks and boards, nothing phony about any of it.
This was before he picked up a facial scar somewhere.
This is where you'll be going.
An island fortress, really.
After the war, the nationality of the island was uncertain.
And sometime after that, Han bought it.
What do you know about Han?
He lives like a king on that island.
Totally self-sufficient.
All of his efforts, seemingly...
... aredirectedtowardsupporting what he calls his "school of martial arts."
Han's only contact with the outside world is this tournament...
... whichheholdseverythreeyears .
This was a stewardess, Mary King, found floating in the harbor.
Nothing unusual about a body in the harbor.
But this girl was last seen at a party aboard Han's private junk.
They'd reported her lost at sea before the body was found.
We believe he selects attractive girls methodically builds their dependence on drugs then sells them to an elite clientele around the world.
What did the autopsy reveal as the cause of death?
-She did not drown.
-She OD'd?
Yes.
Cause of death was heroin overdose.
You still don't have enough to bust up his operation.
We know everything.
We can prove nothing.
We want you to go in there as our agent.
-Get us our evidence.
-And get out in one piece to give it to you.
We'll give you anything you need.
Electronic equipment, weapons, anything.
-Drink?
-No, thanks.
Guns.
Now, why doesn't somebody pull out a .45 and bang, settle it?
No.
No guns.
Look at this map here.
As you know, the possession of a weapon is a serious offense here.
Han's island rests partly within our territorial waters.
If we had the slightest reason to believe he has any kind of arsenal...
... we'dmovein on him.
Besides, Han would never allow guns on the island anyway.
He had a bad experience with them once and he's fearful of assassination.
You can't really blame him.
Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.
I guess I won't need anything.
There's a radio on the island.
We'll monitor it...
... onthechanceyou can get toit.
And then you come?
Someone will.
We aren't an agency of enforcement.
We function as gatherers of information, evidence.
Upon which interested governments can act.
I see.
If there's any trouble, you make a phone call.
Oh, by the way, two months ago...
... wemanagedto placeafemaleoperative on the island.
Since then, we've lost her.
If she's there, she might have something.
Name's Mei Ling.
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.
But now the time has come to tell you something very difficult.
I'm happy you have decided to go to Han's tournament.
Yeah.
The last of the tournaments were held three years ago.
I was in the city with your sister at that time.
I didn't know that.
Yes.
Many of Han's men had come in from the island.
They were everywhere, bullying and arrogant.
We were on our way into town.
Stay back!
Run !
Run !
Now!
Now you know the truth.
When you get to the city...
... payyourrespectstoyoursister and your mother.
I will, old man.
You will not agree with what I am going to do.
It is contrary to all that you have taught me...
... andallthatSuLinbelieved.
I must leave.
Please try to find a way to forgive me.
Double or nothing?
That's about 1 000 bucks a foot, Roper.
Why not?
I'm sorry, Mr. Roper isn't in right now.
May I take a message?
That's a tough shot, Mr. Roper.
Excuse me, fellas.
-I say he can't make it.
-What'll you bet?
You gotta love him.
Come on, Roper.
It's 1 75 big ones by Monday the 1 5th.
Only 1 50.
You forget interest.
-Maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.
-You take advantage, Roper.
Come on, fellas.
It's the dough, Roper, or we gotta break something.
You got it?
Freddie says this is for your own good.
Better confirm that flight to Hong Kong for me.
-How much do I have left in the bank?
-$63.43.
-It's all yours.
-Thanks.
-Only, I think you'll need it.
-You wanna bet?
Double-punching.
Ready... .
Going on a trip, are you?
-Hey, this jig's got a passport.
-Where you going, jig?
-Where's the plane ticket for?
-Hong Kong, via Hawaii.
He's not going to Hawaii.
Well, look what we got here!
Assaulting a police officer.
-Hey, soldier, shape it up!
-Roper!
Hey, how are you, man?
How am I, man?
How am I?
I'm glad to see you, that's how I am.
-Hey, how long has it been?
Five... ?
-Six years, man.
-Six.
-It's not as long as it seems.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
-What you been doing since Nam?
-Hanging in a little bit.
-All these yours?
-Always first-class.
Same old Roper.
Come here.
-Parsons.
-Yeah, from New Zealand.
This man's putting quite a collection together.
Know him?
Never saw him before.
What do you know about this Han cat?
Just rumors.
I hear he likes to live big.
They don't live so big over there.
Ghettos are the same all over the world.
They stink.
Same old Williams.
Yeah.
What have we got here?
A little action.
Insects.
Okay, I'll lay you 50 bucks on the big one.
Fifty. $50 on the big one, all right?
I'll give you 5-to-1 .
Would you bet 1 00?
You're on.
Come on, let's end this thing quickly.
Thattababy.
Come on.
Come on !
That's it.
Just get him on his back.
Get him on his back!
Come on.
Come on.
Give up!
Come on !
Hey.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Would you believe that?
Dumb shit.
Do I bother you?
Don't waste yourself.
-What's your style?
-My style?
You can call it the art of fighting without fighting.
"The art of fighting without fighting"?
-Show me some of it.
-Later.
All right.
Don't you think we need more room?
Where else?
That island, on the beach.
We can take this boat.
Okay.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, are you crazy?
Pull me in !
Pull me in !
Don't try to pull yourself up or I'll let go of the line.
Would you look at that.
A woman like that could teach you a lot about yourself.
Welcome.
This way.
I'll show you to your rooms.
The banquet begins promptly at 8.
I think you'll find our little island quite charming.
Say, I hope you haven't spent all that money you won from me yesterday.
-I plan to win it back.
-Oh?
How?
You'll find out, after you've lost it.
You seem to be very much at home here, Mr. Roper.
This guy Han's got a great sense of hospitality.
And a fantastic sense of style.
Yeah, it's great.
Then why are you so apprehensive?
Apprehensive?
No.
I was just wondering whether it was okay to drink the water.
Mr. Roper, don't con me.
Wanna bet?
No.
I really don't think so.
Thanks.
What's the matter, you on a diet?
I'd like to eat, if I could find something I could keep down.
Well, I can't wait to meet our host.
I hear this is only one of his B parties.
You ever been to a martial arts tournament like this?
Never.
I have a funny feeling we're being fattened up for the kill.
Better keep an eye out for the referee.
-Know what I mean?
-Yeah.
Gentlemen, welcome.
You honor our island.
I look forward to a tournament...
... oftrulyepicproportions.
We are unique, gentlemen...
... inthatwecreateourselves...
... throughlongyears of rigorous training...
... sacrifice,denial,pain.
We forge our bodies in the fire of our will.
But tonight, let us celebrate.
Gentlemen, you have our gratitude.
Mr. Williams.
Mr. Williams!
For me?
You shouldn't have.
But... .
I'll take you, darling.
And you.
Please understand, if I missed anyone...
... it'sbeenabigday.
I'm a little tired.
Oh, of course, Mr. Williams.
You must conserve your strength.
Come in.
A gift, Mr. Lee.
-If you don't see anything you like... .
-There was a girl at the feast tonight.
Which girl, sir?
The owner of this dart.
Oh, yes.
I know the one.
I'll send her to you.
Another fine mess you got me into.
Come in.
Hi.
Well, well, one more lovely than the next.
What did you have in mind?
Pick one.
I already have.
Wise decision.
I wanna talk to you, Mei Ling.
Where do you come from?
-Braithwaite--
-Let's be quiet.
Have you seen anything?
Nothing much.
I'm kept in the palace, watched always.
I know nothing of Han's activities away from the palace.
But I can tell you this: people disappear.
-Who?
-The girls.
Every one of them.
They're summoned to Han's at night and the next day they're gone.
I know I don't have much time.
You must attend the morning ritual in uniform.
Outside.
Mr. Lee, why you no wear uniform?
Gentlemen, let the tournament begin !
Bolo.
Good work.
You made me some bread.
-Mr.
Roper.
-I'm ready.
Okay.
I got myself a real pigeon here.
Keep the action going for me, will you?
What do you think, Roper?
Oh, no sweat.
Give my friend 8-to-3 all the way.
I'm finding out about myself.
This is the real me, definitely.
Do you like it here?
Oh, yeah.
But a little lower.
No.
I mean here on the island.
Yeah, I like it here.
But a little lower.
A man like you belongs here.
To you, I'm just another pretty face.
Where you go?
Out in the moonlight, baby.
-It is not allowed.
You must stay.
-Oh?
Goodbye.
A human fly.
Gentlemen...
... itseemsthatoneofyou ...
... wasnotcontentlastnight...
... withthehospitalityofthepalace...
... andsoughtdiversion elsewhere on the island.
Who it was is not important...
... atthistime.
What is important is that...
... myguardsperformed their duties incompetently.
And now they must prove...
... themselvesworthy to remain among us.
Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?
Only at how sloppy your man works.
Mr. Lee?
Are you ready?
Boards don't hit back.
-Bolo.
-Go!
Oharra!
Oharra's treachery has disgraced us.
If you wanna talk about this thing, I'll be in my room.
Gotcha.
Williams?
Williams.
-Go to Han's study as soon as possible.
-All right.
Hey, Roper.
I'll see you in half an hour.
Right.
-Mr.
Han?
-You fought well yesterday.
Your style is unorthodox.
But effective.
It is not the art, but the combat that you enjoy.
The winning.
We are all ready to win...
... justaswe areborn knowing only life.
It is defeat that you must learn to prepare for.
I don't waste my time with it.
When it comes, I won't even notice.
Oh?
How so?
I'll be too busy looking good.
What were you looking for when you attacked my guards?
Wasn't me.
You were the only man outside the palace.
I was outside, but I wasn't the only one.
You will tell me who else.
Mr. Han, suddenly I'd like to leave your island.
-It is not possible.
-Bullshit, Mr. Han-Man !
Man, you come right out of a comic book.
Been practicing, huh?
-Williams is expecting me in my room.
-I wanted to talk to you.
We will meet your friend Williams later.
-Okay.
-This is my museum.
It is difficult to associate these horrors...
... withtheproudcivilizations that created them:
Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe, the samurai.
They worship strength because it is strength...
... thatmakesallothervaluespossible.
Nothing survives without it.
Who knows what delicate wonders have died out of the world...
... forwantof thestrengthtosurvive.
What's this?
A souvenir.
-Up here.
-A guillotine?
No, thanks.
This is the only angle I care to see it from.
If you please, Mr. Roper.
You want me to put my head on that thing?
An act of faith.
I'm a man of little faith, Mr. Han.
Very few people can be totally ruthless.
It isn't easy.
It takes more strength than you might believe.
Now you've got eight more.
Then there is a point you will not go beyond.
Faked out again.
This way.
Our power plant.
Oh, yeah.
A lifetime of women, huh?
A man's strength can be measured by his appetites.
Indeed, a man's strength flows from his appetites.
Oh, no.
They are my daughters.
Your daughters?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought that-- I misunderstood.
Miss Han?
And also, they are my most personal guard.
I admire your judgment.
Nobody's as loyal as daddy's little girl.
-Mr.
Roper?
-No, thanks.
I'll get up myself.
Nice meeting you.
Opium.
We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper.
The business of corruption is like any other.
Oh, yeah.
Provide your customers with products they need...
... andencouragethatneedalittlebit to stimulate your market...
... prettysoonyourcustomers depend on you.
I mean, really need you.
It's the law of economics.
Right.
And here we are stimulating quite another need.
You wonder why I am exposing so much of myself?
I forget what I see very easily.
But then, why are you?
I'm hoping you'll join us, represent us in the United States.
I'm beginning to understand the thing with the tournament.
The whole setup.
It's a great way to recruit new talent, huh?
And who are they?
The refuse found in waterfront bars.
Shanghaied?
Just lost, drunken men who no longer care where they find themselves each morning.
You left some rather sizable debts in America.
Diners Club hasn't called in my card yet.
There were some questions which I was forced to ask.
I got no answers.
And you want me to join this?
There are certain realities.
I want us to have a clear understanding.
No.
There's no misunderstanding between us.
Help me.
Help, I'm 1 7!
I'm from California.
Help me!
Please, help me!
Mister, come back, please!
You have to come back.
Please!
-Help me!
Help me!
-Hey, quiet!
Shut up!
The battle with the guards was magnificent.
Your skill is extraordinary.
And I was going to ask you to join us.
My God.
This came in half an hour ago.
Why didn't I--?
Hello.
Put your colonel on.
Well, wake him up.
I don't care if he's not alone.
Damn it all, I don't care who he's with !
You bloody well put him on the line!
Good morning, Mr. Roper.
We have been waiting for you.
What's going on?
Would you be good enough to participate in this morning's edification?
Edification.
What are you gonna do to him?
Not me, Mr. Roper.
You.
Bolo?
Like you said...
... there'sa pointIwon 'tgobeyond.
I was right about you.
We shall strive to be worthy of your sense of grandeur.
I will find someone with whom you can fight.
Bolo.
Quick, go destroy them.
Kill !
Kill them !
Kill !
Fools!
You have offended my family and you have offended a Shaolin temple.
Remember the enemy has only images and illusions behind which he hides his true motives.
Destroy the image and you will break the enemy.
[ENGLISH]
Stories of a little hunter from the stone age.
Ancient and silent is the face of Earth.
But even a single stone has its memory.
It's a witness of life on Earth... in its countless metamorphoses.
After long evolution, a human comes... and gives the stone a form.
The roughly trimmed rock is a small miracle of a human will.
The first sharp working tools, which serve a human,... help and kill.
A stone is transformed into a bear's claw, a wolf's tooth, an eagle's beak.
And launched by the power of a stretched bow, it lengthens the hands of hunters into the middle of herds... for which human legs weren't enough.
In this form, stone has its secrets.
Maybe prehistoric man hid in them his faith and hope in the power of nature... which he didn't understand and which he was afraid of.
Relics about the life, human spirit, and a cultured people.
Maybe just this dish was a witness of a similar story to that which our film tells.
¤ SETTLEMENT OF CROWS ¤
Stop!
Be hailed sun, father of all life.
You who wakes up rivers... trees and animals... hear us, hear a request from the Raven House.
Look at our grain... let it grow in our land... cast out hunger... cast out disease... cast out death.
Give milk.
Give fertility.
Give power.
Give grain.
Mother Earth, you who maintains us, cures us and sustains us... feed us.
The river brought him.
No, he's not one of us.
He's yours --- you have found him.
Let the house of Falcons care for him.
He's hungry.
Why feed one more throat?
But it's a child.
A wolf kills her cubs when she has no food for them.
No!
Do you have meat, grain, or honey?
Will you reduce your share?
What do you want to give him?
Let's kill him.
Wait!
The Father of Ravens doesn't want him to die.
Give him to the women.
Where are you from, puppy?
Do you want to bite me?
Bite, rip!
He's like a wolf.
Just snarl, you'll be a man.
Come here, youngling.
Feed him.
Hunger.
There'll be hunger.
Veverice, don't interfere.
Do you want him?
What's your name?
Havranpirko {"Raven-feather"}.
Do you want to hunt?
Back to work.
A fox!
Havranpirko!
Sokol!
Were you scared?
Pay attention, death doesn't give a warning.
How did you do the animal?
I'll never be a hunter like you.
Or like Divous.
A hunter grows up slowly.
Do you want to try it?
Wait.
No hurry.
Wait for him to come down.
Look, Father of Raven, I hunted it down.
Lies!
It's not your arrow!
Give it here!
Sokol killed it.
Not you.
Don't fight!
Raven!
Don't punish them, Father of Ravens,... don't be angry at your house.
Wait, Veverice.
You can't hunt.
Do you like it?
Sokol, he says he killed a falcon.
Is it true?
Your arrow was in it.
Havranpirko doesn't lie.
He killed the falcon.
Don't go there, it'll be bad.
You've fought too.
Wait.
You stained the sacred place by a fight.
Now show how you can stand pain.
Come for your death.
Fall!
Boars!
Boars!
Boars!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Boars!
Boars!
Do it.
Wake up!
Let's go.
Havranpirko... guard the women.
Go.
Come for your death!
Fall!
Divous is the best hunter and my axe is the most beautiful.
Let it go!
Do you hear?
Thieves!
Robbers!
Let it go!
Do you hear?
Havranpirko!
Shut up!
Stand still!
~ You'll go with us!
With me.
~ No!
Let her go!
Didn't you hear me?
Veverice, run!
You killed him!
He killed Havranpirko!
I'll kill anyone who stands against me!
I wish the black death took you.
Havranpirko.
~ Where is Veverice?
~ They've taken her.
And the calf's gone, too.
Weren't you the guard?
It's your fault.
I'll bring help.
Raven!
Divous!
Help!
Raven!
What's happened?
They've kidnapped Veverice.
They've stolen a calf.
Home, quickly!
Help him.
Wait.
Wait.
Look after him.
He has to get to the big river.
No.
Catch the calf!
You'll be mine whether you like it or not.
They have to have a boat here.
Search!
To the river!
Sokol, here!
Thieves!
Drown!
The main thing is we grabbed a calf.
Look out!
Will he come?
No.
He's a falcon.
He will fly.
Merchants!
Merchants!
Merchants!
Accept this as a gift, Raven, so good will will rule.
Welcome.
We offer salt, flints, and cloth.
We'll give you skins, honey, and finished clothing.
~ I agree.
~ Very well.
A hunter kills by one shot.
Salt!
Too little!
Add some.
Flints.
Two.
That many.
It's too many.
I'm giving you best skins.
I will find another merchant!
Give them to him.
Move.
Next.
Show me.
~ Do you have more such stones?
~ Sure.
Who gave these to you?
I don't know.
The big river brought me with them.
Come with me.
Gold, pure gold!
Check this out.
Take!
All!
He's said all.
So take it!
Salt, who wants more salt?
You've lost your mind.
Even Divous didn't get so much.
Salt, who wants my salt?
Why are you staring?
Get lost.
Ha has to get meat.
Mashed up.
Else he will die.
Where are you going?
No!
You can't do that.
He's hungry.
Why can't I hunt ravens?
They're fathers of our fathers.
Not mine.
I was brought by a flood.
You're a raven now.
Did you bring meat?
There's not a single squirrel in the woods.
Head on back.
Raven!
There's hunger!
Open up the granary!
Raven!
I divided fairly all grain.
Every cottage got its share.
Even you, Divous.
Let's kill the cow.
And we'll all eat a bellyful.
Do you hear?
One cow!
One cow wouldn't be enough!
And we must wait for calves!
So open the granary!
Yes!
Give us grain!
No!
Not all will survive the winter.
Maybe not even me.
But the grain must be our seed crop!
If not for us then for our children.
Go back to your fires.
What are you waiting for?
Should I chase you off like dogs?
I'll kill anyone who tries to touch the grain.
I'll kill...
Father of ravens, remember!
Every time I gave you blood still hot... from every prey, the best piece to you... and you...
Now when you should help me not to die from hunger... you don't listen to my requests.
Give me back the strength of hunter.
Give me at least little mouse.
Do you hear me?
Come closer.
Don't be afraid, boy.
Thief!
I've caught a thief!
He's stolen our grain.
Judge him.
So say something!
Speak!
He can't.
Like a punched marmot.
Your Havranpirko!
And I haven't said the worst yet.
Is something worse than rob own house?
No!
I didn't kill it!
Not me!
He's not a raven anymore.
He's got no roof.
He's got no fire.
No one knows him.
It's not true.
Veverice.
It's not true.
Havranpirko.
Havranpirko.
I've got a clue.
I've got it.
Come, come with me.
Where do you want to go?
~ Sun, there, big.
~ Havranpirko.
Nods at me.
I'm coming!
Wait.
Havranpirko is dying.
You won't tell anyone.
You robbed.
You killed the raven.
I'll tear your tongue off for this.
Let me go!
You're leaving at sunrise.
Come home, boy.
He was the best hunter.
They'll die without fire.
They'll die without a house.
How many arrows?
I have nothing to teach you.
You're a hunter of the house.
Stories Of A Little Hunter From The Stone Age Part One
Ancient and silent is the face of Earth.
But even a single stone has its memory's.
It's a witness of life on earth and its countless metamorphoses.
After long evolution, a human comes and gives the stone a form.
The roughly trimmed rock is a small miracle of a human will.
The first sharp working tools, which served humans both helped and killed.
A stone is transformed into a bear's claw, a wolf's tooth, an eagle's beak.
And launched by the power of a stretched bow it lengthens the arms of hunters into the middle of herds for which human legs weren't enough.
In this form, a stone has its secrets.
Maybe prehistoric man hid his faith and hope in them in the power of nature which he didn't understand and which he was afraid.
Relics about life, human spirit and a culture of people.
Maybe this dish was a witness of a similar story to that which our film tells.
SETTLEMENT OF CROWS from the novel by Edward Storch
Director:
Jan Schmidt
Stop!
Be hailed sun, father of all life.
You who wakes up rivers trees and animals.
Hear us hear a request from Raven House.
Watch over our grain let it grow on our land cast out hunger cast out disease
cast out death.
Give milk.
Give fertility.
Give power.
Give grain.
Mother Earth, you who maintains us cures us and sustains us
feed us.
The river brought him.
He is not one of us.
You found him, he's yours.
Let the House of Falcons care for him.
He's hungry.
Why feed another mouth?
But it's a child.
A wolf kills her cubs when she has no food for them.
Do you have meat, grain or honey?
Will you reduce your share?
What will you give to him?
Let's kill him.
Wait!
The Father of Ravens doesn't want him to die.
Give him to the women.
Where are you from, puppy?
You want to bite me?
Bite me, rip me!
He's like a wolf.
Just snarl, you'll be a man.
Come here, youngster.
Feed him.
Hunger.
There will be hunger.
Junk!
Veverice, don't interfere.
Do you want him?
What's your name?
Havranpirko "Raven-Feather"
You want to hunt?
Back to work.
A fox!
Havranpirko!
Sokole!
Were you scared?
Pay attention death doesn't give any warning.
How did you fake the animal tracks?
I'll never be a great hunter like you.
Or like Divous.
A hunter grows up slowly.
Do you want to try it?
Wait.
No hurry.
Wait for him to come down.
Look, Father of Ravens, I hunted it down.
Lies!
It's not your arrow!
Give it here!
Sokole killed it.
Not you.
Don't fight!
Raven is coming!
Don't punish them Father of Ravens don't be angry at your house.
Wait, Veverice.
You can't hunt.
You like it?
Sokole he says he killed the falcon.
Is it true?
Your arrow was in it.
Havranpirko doesn't lie.
He killed the falcon.
Don't go back, Father will be mad.
You fought too.
Wait.
You stained the sacred place by fighting.
Now show how you can stand pain.
Come for your death.
Die!
Boars!
Boars!
Boars!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Boars!
Boars!
No time!
Do it.
Wake up!
Let's go.
Havranpirko guard the women.
Go.
Come...
Come for your death!
Die!
Divous may be the best hunter, but my axe is the most beautiful.
Let it go!
Do you hear me?
Thieves!
Robbers!
Let it go!
Do you hear me?
Havranpirko!
Shut up!
Stand still!
You will come with us!
With me!
No!
Let her go!
Didn't you hear me?
Veverice, run!
You killed him!
He killed Havranpirko!
I'll kill anyone who stands in my way!
I wish the black death upon you.
Where is Veverice?
They've taken her.
And the calf is gone, too.
You were the guard.
You didn't protect us!
It's your fault.
I'll get help.
Raven!
Divous!
Divous!
Raven!
What happened?
They've kidnapped Veverice.
They've stolen a calf.
Home, quickly!
Help him.
Wait.
Wait.
Look after him.
He has to get to the big river.
No.
Catch the calf!
You'll be mine whether you like it or not.
They must have a boat.
Look for it.
To the river!
Sokole, here!
Thieves!
Drown!
At least we got the calf.
Look out!
Will he come?
No.
He's a falcon.
He will fly.
Merchants!
Merchants!
Merchants!
Accept this gift, Raven so good will rule.
Welcome.
We offer salt, flints and cloth.
We'll give you skins, honey, and finished clothing.
I agree.
Very well.
A hunter kills with one shot.
Salt!
Too little!
Add more.
Flints.
Two.
That many.
That's too many.
I'm giving you my best skins.
I will sell to another merchant!
Give them to him.
Move.
Next!
Show me.
Do you have more such stones?
Who gave you these?
I don't know.
They came down the big river with me.
Come with me.
Gold, pure gold!
Check this out.
Take!
All!
He's said all.
Take it!
Salt, who wants more salt?
You've lost your mind.
Even Divous didn't get so much.
Salt, who wants my salt?
What are you staring at?
Get lost.
He needs meat mashed up or he will die.
Where are you going?
No!
You can't do that.
He's hungry.
Why can't I hunt ravens?
They are fathers of our fathers.
Not mine.
I was brought by a flood.
You're a Raven now.
Did you bring meat?
There's not a single squirrel in the woods.
Head on back.
Raven!
There's hunger!
Open up the granary!
Raven!
I divided all grain fairly.
Every cottage got its share.
Even you, Divous.
Let's kill the cow.
And we'll all eat.
Do you hear me?
One cow!
One cow wouldn't be enough!
And we must wait for calves!
So open the granary!
- Yes!
- Give us grain!
No!
Not all will survive the winter.
Maybe not even me.
But the grain must be our seed crop!
If not for us then for our children.
Go back to your fires.
What are you waiting for?
Should I chase you off like dogs?
I'll kill anyone who tries to touch the grain.
I'll Kill...
I'll kill...
Father of Ravens, remember!
Every time I gave you meat from every prey, blood still hot...
the best piece to you... and you...
Now is when you should help me to not die from hunger you don't listen to my requests.
Give me back the strength of hunter.
Give me at least little mouse.
Do you hear me?
Come closer.
Don't be afraid, boy.
Thief!
I've caught a thief!
He's stolen our grain.
Judge him.
Say something!
Speak!
He can't.
Like a punched marmot.
Your Havranpirko!
And I haven't said the worst yet.
Is anything worse than robbing your own house?
No!
I didn't kill it!
Not me!
He's not a Raven anymore.
He has no roof.
He has no fire.
No one knows him.
It's not true.
Veverice.
It's not true.
Havranpirko.
Havranpirko.
I've got a clue.
I've got it.
Come, come with me.
Where do you want to go?
Sun, there, big.
Havranpirko.
Nod at me.
I'm coming!
Coming...
Wait.
Havranpirko is dying.
You won't tell anyone.
You robbed...
You killed the raven.
I'll rip your tongue out for this.
Let me go!
You're leaving at sunrise.
Come home, boy.
He was the best hunter.
They'll die without fire.
They'll die without a house.
How many arrows?
I have nothing more to teach you.
You are a hunter of the house.
I believe there's a reservation for me
- Anne Silver.
Yes, that's right.
Room 320.
My mother phoned.
How did she know I was here?
I'm afraid I don't know.
I see.
You're here for the opening of your film at the Roxy?
You're the directress - isn't that how you say it?
That must be fascinating work.
Is there a phone in the room?
Of course.
Excuse me.
Is this the front desk?
I'd like 27-15-76 in Prato, Italy.
Thank you.
A two-hour wait?
Yes, I'll wait.
I realize two hours haven't gone by yet, but I found a pearl-gray silk tie.
I'm sure it's silk.
The label even says so.
It's on two hangers on the left side of the closet.
I left it there.
It probably belongs to the man here before me, perhaps the man having a beer in the lobby.
He was leaving.
He had a small suitcase.
I didn't notice if he was wearing a tie.
It isn't his?
I thought it was.
Should I leave it here?
All right.
Call me back in two hours.
A bit less by now.
Yes, everything's fine.
I like the room.
Could you get me 68-95-27 in Cologne, Germany?
They haven't lived there long, but they do have a phone.
Anyway, I doubt if they're in now.
Hello?
Yes, it's me, Ida.
Yes, I'm here, but I don't have time to stop by.
I'm just calling to say hello.
No, I really can't.
No, there's no point in you coming here.
I'm very busy.
I can't talk long.
I'm waiting for an important call.
Yes, I'm leaving Cologne tomorrow night on the express.
The manager of the Roxy is waiting downstairs with a reporter?
Tell them I'll be right down.
You can cancel my call to Italy.
Is something wrong?
We don't love each other.
I feel like I've known you forever.
But you haven't.
Get dressed.
It's been a long time since I looked at the night.
You meet a woman... and go to her place.
You think something wonderful's going to happen.
You get your hopes up, and then suddenly... she says, "Get dressed."
And you're alone once again.
Is life always like that?
No, you mustn't say that.
I often let someone see me home, but I don't say, "Get dressed."
I let it happen.
But I don't tell myself it will be wonderful.
I don't think I tell myself anything.
Anyway, I leave tomorrow.
You know, Heinrich...
I used to think that when someone held my hand, it meant "I love you."
So I'd give them my hand and all the rest.
Would you like my address?
You never know.
This is my home phone.
The other is the school where I teach.
Ah, you're a teacher.
Just grade school.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow at 4:00.
Tomorrow's my daughter's birthday.
- How old is she?
- She'll be five.
I could have had a daughter who'd be five now.
Two daughters, in fact.
The other would be six now.
I'd have called them Judith and Rebecca - nice names.
But the time wasn't right.
It's nobody's fault.
What's your daughter like?
Does she love you?
Yes, I think so.
She's very affectionate and a bit shy.
You should meet her.
She's probably asleep right now.
Yes, children sleep at night.
You should come meet her tomorrow.
You'll still be here tomorrow afternoon.
She'd really like that.
I'll pick you up around noon.
If you like.
See you tomorrow.
Good night.
It's noon?
I'll be right down.
You just missed a phone call.
While I was in the elevator?
It always happens.
Perhaps so.
Your mother called, and a gentleman called from Paris.
Neither left a message.
I see.
Everything all right?
May I leave my bag here and pick it up later?
Of course.
This is where I live.
In summer the garden's full of flowers, especially tulips.
There have always been tulips here.
My father planted them.
Tulips were his hobby, but he died at Stalingrad.
Now I look after them.
I was born here.
I love this house.
We were lucky.
It was spared during the war.
Do you like flowers?
Not much, but it doesn't matter.
Are we in the suburbs here?
- Sorry.
- Doesn't matter.
Good thing we're not in the suburbs.
Good thing, yes.
Why?
I don't like the suburbs.
These aren't the suburbs.
It's a separate town.
Bottrop.
My father and grandfather lived here.
Now I live here with my mother and daughter.
My wife left me... for a Turk.
A very dark type.
She lives in Frankfurt.
She left me, so I got custody of the child.
I was depressed for a while, but then it passed.
I thought we got along well.
It happened so quickly.
Everything seemed peaceful.
It really seemed we'd spend our lives together.
It's true that we could go for weeks lying side by side without feeling any desire, but it didn't matter.
And often... when I'd turn around to go to sleep... she'd nestle up against me.
It was so peaceful to melt into her, her smell, her flesh.
And if she fell asleep first and turned her back to me, then I'd nestle against her and feel her round buttocks in the hollow of my stomach.
We never argued or raised our voices.
I worked and looked after my flowers.
She'd quit working to take care of Julia, who was still very young.
And then they ran away together.
I only saw them together once.
Their attraction to each other was so clear, like iron to a magnet, that I didn't even try to fight it.
She never visits, not even to see the child.
Unusual for a woman.
But I guess it's better that way.
So I feel rather lonely at times, especially since my best friend, Hans, left Germany.
He worked at the same school.
All the kids loved him.
We'd known each other forever, you might say, and then one day he was fired.
Someone denounced him, I think.
We never found out who.
They accused him of unpatriotic activities, of being an enemy of the state.
He did have different ideas, yet he and I weren't so very different.
We breathed the same air, enjoyed the same music - Handel and Mozart.
We knew Don Giovanni by heart.
We'd sing it together, acting out all the parts.
He had such a fine voice.
But sometimes he'd get depressed.
You might even say desperate.
Perhaps that's what they meant by an "enemy of the state."
I never really understood what happened.
You know, Anne, in Germany in the '20s, the Communists brought hope to lots of people.
Equality for everyone, sharing the wealth.
Then came '33... and the Communists and many others... were put in camps and killed.
The new regime gave people new hope after those bleak years.
Work for everyone, a greater and better Germany - so they said.
Then came the war.
And one day the war ended.
And the Russians, Americans, British, French, and Belgians arrived.
They divided Germany in two.
They took the remaining Nazis and killed them or locked them up.
And there was peace.
They rebuilt Germany from the ruins.
Everyone pitched in.
Then one day my friend lost his job, and I lost a friend, a truly good man.
What have they done to my country?
I ask myself what will become of us.
Let's go inside.
They're waiting for us.
Do you really have to go?
You ate so quickly.
I wasn't hungry, and there was too much.
Tell your mother it was very good and that I'm sorry for spilling coffee on the tablecloth.
It wasn't my fault.
- No, it wasn't.
My mother will forgive you.
She likes you, and so does my daughter.
The whole family likes you already.
Tell your daughter I like her very much.
Give her a kiss for me.
You're going to leave me all alone.
You shouldn't have come.
Yes, you should have.
My mother wants me to stop in Brussels.
She'll be at the station.
That's all she said?
She didn't say why?
This one's from Daniel in Paris.
Are there lots of trains to Cologne?
- All the time.
Is there a nonstop train from here to Brussels?
Then I'll have to go via Cologne.
It's busy.
The lines to Italy are always overloaded.
You get 10 marks back.
Ida!
How's life in Germany?
You getting used to it?
Yes.
The recession isn't as bad as in Belgium.
One has to earn a living.
You never know what might happen.
And I can speak German here.
I never really got used to French, even after 25 years in Belgium.
So it's almost as if we never left Germany.
One mustn't dwell on the past, you know.
We have no family left there anymore.
Most of them are dead, and the rest are scattered.
The worst thing is that all our friends are back there.
Luckily we met another couple who left Belgium, so we get together sometimes.
You speak German that well?
I thought you were Polish.
I don't speak it all that well, but I get along.
Have you heard from your mother?
Do you write to her?
Yes.
Her letters are always the same, and I reply that everything's fine.
Someone who saw her in Brussels said she had backaches and she was very tired.
She's also taken up smoking in her old age, but otherwise she's fine.
I got a letter from her a month ago.
She's like a sister to me.
She said she thought of you a lot.
I think about her too.
Did you come here to talk about my mother?
Your train's half an hour late.
I got that.
I didn't know you spoke German.
I don't, but I understood that.
I'm hungry.
- Then come on.
I have to make a call.
I'm not so hungry anymore.
Let's go back.
You never know.
It's wonderful to be an artist.
I wanted to be an artist too.
I was good at drawing when I was young.
You're very fortunate.
You get to travel all over the place.
I don't mean to be nosy, but if you don't have anyone, you know that my son's still waiting for you.
I'll ask one last time:
Will you marry my son?
Don't tell me it's all over.
You still write each other.
Why write if you don't love each other?
Let writers write.
But don't do like last time.
You say yes, and then you disappear, and no one hears from you for months.
If you didn't want to, why say yes?
And not just once, but twice.
Anyway, let's drop it.
It's long forgotten.
But to break your engagement - twice - I never heard of such a thing.
You just don't do that.
Without a word of explanation.
Don't you want children?
Yes.
Well then?
Your father would be so happy.
He's always saying, "I may die before I see any grandchildren."
And you know... when your parents are dead and you have no kids, what's left?
Nothing.
Unless you have kids.
You realize that?
Maybe you don't like children.
Who knows with you?
- I like children.
- Well then?
Maybe later.
I hope you don't decide when it's too late.
I promise I'll think about it.
I'll write to him.
If you had someone else, I'd understand.
But to be all alone is no life - especially for a girl.
You say you're happy, and I believe you.
You look happy.
Sometimes I don't understand.
The world's topsy-turvy.
Women used to pray to find a husband, afraid they wouldn't be good enough for anyone, but now -
It'll all end badly... very badly.
I remember when I fell in love with my husband.
I was 13.
I fell in love just looking at him.
He was so handsome.
A good-looking boy.
I was so proud to walk down the street with him.
He was so kind.
It's the war that changed him, all those terrible things that happened.
Now he's become irritable and seems to blame me for all that happened.
Who else can he blame?
But we can't complain.
We worked hard, and now we're rich.
And my eldest son is happily married with three lovely children, thank God.
Two would have been enough.
And he lives in America.
He refuses to set foot in Germany.
So we went to visit.
He's a real scholar.
A professor.
But my husband's become irritable and fussy.
If one thing's out of place, he yells.
Over nothing at all.
And since it's just me in the house now - we let the maid go when the children left - he yells at me.
But I forgive him.
I know it's not his fault.
And I'd rather he yell at me than sulk for days on end.
I know it makes him feel better.
But when I start to feel down...
I think about the old days... how sweet he was and how proud I felt.
And I think of my children.
My son's a good boy, you know.
Intelligent.
He'd make you happy, and you know it.
You've known each other for so long, practically since you were babies.
There'd be no nasty surprises.
I remember your mother and I pushing our strollers together by the sea.
He's a very sensitive boy.
He'd make you happy.
And a girl should marry.
You'd have beautiful children.
And if you don't have time, I'll look after them.
I know how to raise children.
Whatever you do, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
No smoking.
Passport or ID.
They're reconfiguring the train.
They're uncoupling cars.
Are you going to Paris?
I'm stopping in Brussels first.
And you?
I'm going to Paris.
I see.
What time is it?
Half past ten.
I don't think smoking's allowed.
It is in the corridor.
The train's leaving.
You know Brussels?
That's where I was born.
I lived there for 20 years.
Twenty years?
I spent a week there two years ago.
I like it.
Were you still there then?
No, I left Brussels eight years ago.
Too bad.
Do you know my friends there by any chance, the Vanderlindens?
Don't they have a furniture store?
No, that's not them.
Then I don't know them.
They say Belgium's the land of plenty.
So they say.
Where do you live?
Paris.
I'm going to Paris too.
I'm going to live there because they say France is the land of freedom.
So they say.
Maybe I'll be happy there.
Maybe.
Anyway, you've got to live somewhere.
That's true.
I'm from Berlin.
After that I lived in Hamburg, because there's a port there.
You speak French well.
I always wanted to go to France.
They say that the French carry freedom in their hearts.
So I learned the language and even worked on my accent.
When I was young and on vacation in Spain...
I fell in love with a French girl.
She corrected my mistakes.
When she stopped,
I realized she didn't love me anymore.
The next morning I saw her talking to a Swedish boy... much stronger than me.
I'm going to stay at the Hôtel des Grands Hommes.
You know it?
I see.
I don't speak French as well as you yet.
I don't speak it that well.
When I left Hamburg...
I went to South America.
Perhaps I was dreaming of justice... a grand and glorious thing.
I went from country to country:
Bolivia, Brazil, all over.
It's a strange climate - hot and humid.
I walked a lot... for days and nights on end.
I don't remember much:
gunfire, footsteps, noises, smells, a few words in Spanish.
I met a woman there.
This'll be my sixth country.
This time it will be the right one.
I'm sure of it.
Then I was in Greece.
On an island, practically alone.
That's all right for a while.
Then I returned home to Germany.
But I couldn't take it there either.
Then I remembered France.
Maybe I'll meet a woman there... whom I'll love and who'll love me.
We're coming into Brussels.
You're a real woman now.
I have been for a long time.
You're pale and fair.
You're beautiful.
You have my mother's eyes.
Look at me.
I wish I looked like you.
I miss you.
I have no one to talk to.
But you never talked to me.
You never talked to me.
But you were there.
How's Daddy and my brother?
Your brother's still like a big kid.
And your father's not as strong as before, but he's okay.
But he's got me.
Of course.
And how are you?
A bit tired from so much traveling.
Is there no one to look after you?
If you're tired, come home with me.
No, let's stay here a little longer.
As you wish.
But we can't sleep here in this booth.
Let's get a room, shall we?
Your father will be worried.
But he's probably fallen asleep and won't wake up.
He had a long day, as usual.
Is business going well?
I don't like to talk to you about these things, but now you'd understand.
No, it's not going well.
It's the recession.
It's hit us very hard.
I mean, it's hit everyone, but we're losing everything we've worked for for 30 years.
Sometimes you wonder if it was all worth it.
Your father's very discouraged.
One moment he says it'll pass and we just have to hold on, and the next he asks, "What's the point?"
He sighs and becomes withdrawn.
I try to boost his confidence.
I smile at him.
Sometimes it works, and sometimes he doesn't even notice.
His gaze is turned inward... seeing God knows what.
How are things in Germany these days?
Germany?
There are curtains everywhere, and tulips on every table.
And as a friend of mine says, it's full of Germans.
It's true.
It's full of Germans.
I haven't been there in over 20 years.
It's probably full of opportunity now.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Anyway...
In any case, things will get better.
We have to be strong and keep our hopes up.
And you're doing very well, so all the rest doesn't matter.
I follow your career very closely, you know.
I read all the papers and keep all the articles.
I have some in my bag.
Want to see them?
They make me feel better.
Mama, you've been in Belgium so long, yet you still have an accent.
Everyone tells me I have a good French accent.
Shall we go?
Would you have a room?
- One?
It doesn't have a bathroom.
All right.
Follow me, please.
Shall we go to sleep?
Aren't you going to undress?
Let me just look at you.
How long's it been?
Almost three years.
A long time.
Yes, but you were always with me.
I won't always be.
Yes, you will.
I have to make a call to Italy.
There's no phone here.
Who would you call?
A girlfriend.
How's Pierre?
We stopped seeing each other.
Why?
I was never there.
He was always waiting for me.
One day he'd had enough.
Shall I turn off the light?
So tell me.
I travel all over, you know, showing my films.
I meet all kinds of people.
I often end up all alone at night in my hotel room.
So sometimes I bring someone back with me.
But it's always sad and a bit silly, actually.
But she came to see me at my hotel because she'd liked the film.
We went out for a drink.
She told me about herself, and I told her about myself.
The bar was closing, so we went to another one.
We kept on talking... and then that bar closed too.
We looked for another one.
Everything seemed closed.
The city was deserted.
We didn't want to say good-bye.
So she came up to my room.
We were tired.
We lay down on the bed... and kept talking.
We happened to brush against each other.
Then we kissed.
I don't know how it happened.
I felt sort of nauseous.
I felt sick.
It was too much.
I was confused.
But we kept on kissing.
And then it all became very easy.
I let myself go.
It felt good.
I never imagined it could be like that with a woman.
I had no idea.
We stayed together all night.
And for some strange reason, I thought of you.
I even told her so.
What did she say?
She smiled.
And then?
Nothing.
I had to leave the next day.
Have you seen her since?
We talk on the phone.
I wouldn't dare tell your father.
Don't tell him.
Have you ever loved a woman?
I don't know.
I've never thought about it.
Are you asleep?
Me neither.
You smell nice.
Still the same perfume.
I've worn it a long time.
As long as I can remember.
Sometimes you'd dab me with it before you went out for the evening.
You'd wear that long dress and put your hair up.
You'd ask me to button you up in back.
You couldn't reach.
You were such a well-behaved child.
When we'd go out, you'd say...
"Have a good time."
And when we got back late at night... you'd be lying wide awake... in your bed.
Anna, tell me you love me.
I love you.
Daniel, did you get a haircut?
Now I look even worse than before.
Aren't you exhausted?
You?
Oh, you know me.
What's wrong?
Just the usual grind.
Lots of work.
Are you hungry?
I don't know.
There's nothing at my place.
And I can't stand my place.
I'm thinking of moving.
Yes, your place is dreary.
I'm gonna get a bigger place.
That way if I ever have kids...
You're planning to have kids?
No, not especially.
I was just saying.
Forget I said it.
Maybe you want to be alone.
But we're driving around aimlessly.
Let's find a hotel and eat there.
I want you.
Is this a new shirt?
No, a very old one I never wear.
It looks good on you.
Do it some more.
What do you see in the street?
Cars.
Lots of them?
I'm going to take a bath.
You're going to wash?
Why?
Hello?
What can we get to eat?
All right.
For two, please.
Is the bathroom floor tiled?
Why?
Just asking.
I almost quit three times this week.
It's like tilting at windmills.
And for what?
You're born, you eat, you drink, you screw when you can, you die.
Come in.
I saw a plane.
There's air-conditioning.
Ah, breakfast. 7:30.
No, 8:00, please.
For a moment I was afraid they'd found me.
But that's impossible.
You never know.
You're an important man.
Important!
We can't affect what happens.
We're just carried along by the current.
You know, Anne... sometimes I think...
I should stop paying the rent and the phone bill... and just vanish.
But I can't stop working.
If I stop for a day, like on Sundays, I get dizzy.
You march on or you die.
If I were a woman... know what I'd do?
I'd get pregnant... and forget everything else.
I'd go...
I don't know, somewhere else... live close to nature, breast-feed my kid every two hours.
- Every three hours at first.
- Fine.
Every three hours.
But then I think I should try to fix things, a better life and all that.
But if you ask what a better life would be,
I can't even imagine it.
It's not just about food for everyone.
We know that's not it... though that would be a start.
You know...
I think things will keep getting worse... that the price of milk and honey, the price of happiness... will get so high that something will happen.
It can't go on like this.
I'm always telling myself that.
Especially when I'm shaving.
With the buzz of the razor...
I can shut everything else out... and ideas fill my head.
Everything moves so quickly.
Something's going to happen, something good.
I don't know what I'm saying.
Something good!
People will... listen to music, for example.
What's lovelier than music, than a woman's voice?
Where does a woman's voice come from?
Will you sing for me?
I sing off-key.
You always said you wanted to be a singer.
What should I sing?
Whatever you like.
I wash the dishes Fix coffee with cream
I'm so busy Have no time to dream
I work all day in this cheap little place
Flowers on the table, curtains of lace
Young lovers come here holding hands
Wide-eyed, hopeful They make no demands
They bring in the sun My life they enchant
A bed built for two is all they want
I can't forget how happy they seem
Joy on their faces, smiles that beam
When I think of them in that sad little room
It chases away my workaday gloom
Faces that shine like rays of the sun
So bright that it hurts
So bright that it hurts
I wash the dishes Fix coffee with cream
I'm so busy Have no time to dream
I work all day in this cheap little place
That's where they found them, face to face
Lying together, still holding hands
Dreaming of oceans and golden sands
They were buried in the city, side by side
Even the earth their joy could not hide
When I think of them in that sad little room
It chases away my workaday gloom
Lovers for a day, faces that shine
Like rays of the sun, like rays of the sun
A little sunshine can be so bright
So bright that it hurts
So bright that it hurts
I wash the dishes Fix coffee with cream
I'm too busy Have no time to dream
I work all day in this cheap little place
Flowers on the table, curtains of lace
That was beautiful.
I n a moment we'll make love... and then you'll be off again tomorrow.
And I'll be left wanting you more than ever.
Yes, but at 8:30 a. m., you'll be back at work.
We have 6 1/2 hours left.
It's not much.
What if we just stay still?
Come lie on top of me.
You're shaking.
Suddenly I don't feel well.
Don't move.
You're shivering.
You've got a fever.
Wait.
I'll be right back.
Do you have any medications?
No, I'm sorry.
Thank you anyway.
Turn over.
Don't do that.
I'm away for three days.
I'll be back Wednesday evening.
Anne, it's Michel.
See you at the café Friday at noon as planned.
Don't forget.
See you then.
It's Hélène.
I just got in.
Call me when you get back - 578-11-72.
I hope everything's okay.
I'll be here until Friday, and then I go home.
I hope we don't miss each other this time.
I've got lots to tell you -
It's me.
Anne, this is Jean-Paul.
You need to attend these screenings:
Saturday in Lausanne,
Sunday in Geneva, Monday in Zurich.
You're booked for the 13th at the Hotel Terminus in Lausanne, the 14th at the Mondial in Geneva, and the 15th at the Excelsior in Zurich.
See you soon.
This is Claire.
I'll call when you get back.
Or try calling me after 6:00 at 272-15-76.
See you soon.
That machine again!
This is Alain.
Today's my birthday.
I wanted to spend it with you.
Maybe next year.
Subtitles by Subtext Subtitling, Los Angeles
I believe there's a reservation for me
- Anne Silver.
Yes, that's right.
Room 320.
My mother phoned.
How did she know I was here?
I'm afraid I don't know.
I see.
You're here for the opening of your film at the Roxy?
You're the directress - isn't that how you say it?
That must be fascinating work.
is there a phone in the room?
Of course.
Excuse me.
is this the front desk?
I'd like 27-15-76 in Prato, Italy.
Thank you.
A two-hour wait?
Yes, I'll wait.
I realize two hours haven't gone by yet, but I found a pearl-gray silk tie.
I'm sure it's silk.
The label even says so.
It's on two hangers on the left side of the closet.
I left it there.
It probably belongs to the man here before me, perhaps the man having a beer in the lobby.
He was leaving.
He had a small suitcase.
I didn't notice if he was wearing a tie.
It isn't his?
I thought it was.
Should I leave it here?
All right.
Call me back in two hours.
A bit less by now.
Yes, everything's fine.
I like the room.
Could you get me 68-95-27 in Cologne, Germany?
They haven't lived there long, but they do have a phone.
Anyway, I doubt if they're in now.
Hello?
Yes, it's me, Ida.
Yes, I'm here but I don't have time to stop by.
I'm just calling to say hello.
No, I really can't.
No, there's no point in you coming here.
I'm very busy.
I can't talk long.
I'm waiting for an important call.
Yes, I'm leaving Cologne tomorrow night on the express.
The manager of the Roxy is waiting downstairs with a reporter?
Tell them I'll be right down.
You can cancel my call to Italy.
is something wrong?
We don't love each other.
I feel like I've known you forever.
But you haven't.
Get dressed.
It's been a long time since I looked at the night.
You meet a woman... and go to her place.
You think something wonderful's going to happen.
You get your hopes up, and then suddenly... she says, "Get dressed."
And you're alone once again.
is life always like that?
No, you mustn't say that.
I often let someone see me home but I don't say, "Get dressed."
I let it happen.
But I don't tell myself it will be wonderful.
I don't think I tell myself anything.
Anyway, I leave tomorrow.
You know, Heinrich... I used to think that when someone held my hand, it meant "l love you."
So I'd give them my hand and all the rest.
Would you like my address?
You never know.
This is my home phone.
The other is the school where l teach.
Ah, you're a teacher.
Just grade school.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow at 4:00.
Tomorrow's my daughter's birrhday.
- How old is she?
- She'll be five.
I could have had a daughter who'd be five now.
Two daughters, in fact.
The other would be six now.
I'd have called them Judith and Rebecca - nice names.
But the time wasn't right.
It's nobody's fault.
What's your daughter like?
Does she love you?
Yes, I think so.
She's very affectionate and a bit shy.
You should meet her.
She's probably asleep right now.
Yes, children sleep at night.
You should come meet her tomorrow.
You'll still be here tomorrow afternoon.
She'd really like that.
I'll pick you up around noon.
If you like.
See you tomorrow.
Good night.
It's noon?
I'll be right down.
You just missed a phone call.
While I was in the elevator?
It always happens.
Perhaps so.
Your mother called, and a gentleman called from Paris.
Neither left a message.
I see.
Everything all right?
May I leave my bag here and pick it up later?
Of course.
This is where l live.
In summer the garden's full of flowers, especially tulips.
There have always been tulips here.
My father planted them.
Tulips were his hobby, but he died at Stalingrad.
Now I look after them.
I was born here.
I love this house.
We were lucky.
It was spared during the war.
Do you like flowers?
Not much but it doesn't matter.
Are we in the suburbs here?
- Sorry.
- Doesn't matter.
Good thing we're not in the suburbs.
Good thing, yes.
Why?
I don't like the suburbs.
These aren't the suburbs.
It's a separate town.
Bottrop.
My father and grandfather lived here.
Now I live here with my mother and daughter.
My wife left me... for a Turk.
A very dark type.
She lives in Frankfurt.
She left me so I got custody of the child.
I was depressed for a while, but then it passed.
I thought we got along well.
It happened so quickly.
Everything seemed peaceful.
It really seemed we'd spend our lives together.
It's true that we could go for weeks lying side by side without feeling any desire, but it didn't matter.
And often... when I'd turn around to go to sleep... she'd nestle up against me.
It was so peaceful to melt into her, her smell, her flesh.
And if she fell asleep first and turned her back to me, then I'd nestle against her and feel her round buttocks in the hollow of my stomach.
We never argued or raised our voices.
I worked and looked after my flowers.
She'd quit working to take care of Julia who was still very young.
And then they ran away together.
I only saw them together once.
Their attraction to each other was so clear, like iron to a magnet, that I didn't even try to fight it.
She never visits not even to see the child.
Unusual for a woman.
But I guess it's better that way.
So I feel rather lonely at times, especially since my best friend, Hans, left Germany.
He worked at the same school.
All the kids loved him.
We'd known each other forever you might say, and then one day he was fired.
Someone denounced him, I think.
We never found out who.
They accused him of unpatriotic activities, of being an enemy of the state.
He did have different ideas yet he and I weren't so very different.
We breathed the same air enjoyed the same music - Handel and Mozart.
We knew Don Giovanni by heart.
We'd sing it together, acting out all the parts.
He had such a fine voice.
But sometimes he'd get depressed.
You might even say desperate.
Perhaps that's what they meant by an "enemy of the state."
I never really understood what happened.
You know, Anne, in Germany in the '20s, the Communists brought hope to lots of people.
Equality for everyone, sharing the wealth.
Then came '33... and the Communists and many others... were put in camps and killed.
The new regime gave people new hope after those bleak years.
Work for everyone, a greater and better Germany - so they said.
Then came the war.
And one day the war ended.
And the Russians, Americans British, French, and Belgians arrived.
They divided Germany in two.
They took the remaining Nazis and killed them or locked them up.
And there was peace.
They rebuilt Germany from the ruins.
Everyone pitched in.
Then one day my friend lost his job, and I lost a friend a truly good man.
What have they done to my country?
I ask myself what will become of us.
Let's go inside.
They're waiting for us.
Do you really have to go?
You ate so quickly.
I wasn't hungry, and there was too much.
Tell your mother it was very good and that I'm sorry for spilling coffee on the tablecloth.
It wasn't my fault.
- No, it wasn't.
My mother will forgive you.
She likes you, and so does my daughter.
The whole family likes you already.
Tell your daughter I like her very much.
Give her a kiss for me.
You're going to leave me all alone.
You shouldn't have come.
Yes, you should have.
My mother wants me to stop in Brussels.
She'll be at the station.
That's all she said?
She didn't say why?
This one's from Daniel in Paris.
Are there lots of trains to Cologne?
- All the time.
is there a nonstop train from here to Brussels?
Then I'll have to go via Cologne.
It's busy.
The lines to Italy are always overloaded.
You get 10 marks back.
Ida!
How's life in Germany?
You getting used to it?
Yes.
The recession isn't as bad as in Belgium.
One has to earn a living.
You never know what might happen.
And I can speak German here.
I never really got used to French, even after 25 years in Belgium.
So it's almost as if we never left Germany.
One mustn't dwell on the past, you know.
We have no family left there anymore.
Most of them are dead and the rest are scattered.
The worst thing is that all our friends are back there.
Luckily we met another couple who left Belgium, so we get together sometimes.
You speak German that well?
I thought you were Polish.
I don't speak it all that well, but I get along.
Have you heard from your mother?
Do you write to her?
Yes.
Her letters are always the same, and I reply that everything's fine.
Someone who saw her in Brussels said she had backaches and she was very tired.
She's also taken up smoking in her old age, but otherrwise she's fine.
I got a letter from her a month ago.
She's like a sister to me.
She said she thought of you a lot.
I think about her too.
Did you come here to talk about my mother?
Your train's half an hour late.
I got that.
I didn't know you spoke German.
I don't, but I understood that.
I'm hungry.
- Then come on.
I have to make a call.
I'm not so hungry anymore.
Let's go back.
You never know.
It's wonderful to be an artist.
I wanted to be an artist too.
I was good at drawing when I was young.
You're very fortunate.
You get to travel all over the place.
I don't mean to be nosy, but if you don't have anyone, you know that my son's still waiting for you.
I'll ask one last time:
Will you marry my son?
Don't tell me it's all over.
You still write each other.
Why write if you don't love each other?
Let writers write.
But don't do like last time.
You say yes, and then you disappear, and no one hears from you for months.
If you didn't want to, why say yes?
And not just once, but twice.
Anyway, let's drop it.
It's long forgotten.
But to break your engagement - twice - l never heard of such a thing.
You just don't do that.
Without a word of explanation.
Don't you want children?
Yes.
Well then?
Your father would be so happy.
He's always saying, "l may die before I see any grandchildren."
And you know... when your parents are dead and you have no kids, what's left?
Nothing.
Unless you have kids.
You realize that?
Maybe you don't like children.
Who knows with you?
- l like children.
- Well then?
Maybe later.
I hope you don't decide when it's too late.
I promise I'll think about it.
I'll write to him.
If you had someone else, I'd understand.
But to be all alone is no life - especially for a girl.
You say you're happy, and I believe you.
You look happy.
Sometimes I don't understand.
The world's topsy-turvy.
Women used to pray to find a husband, afraid they wouldn't be good enough for anyone, but now - lt'll all end badly... very badly.
I remember when I fell in love with my husband.
I was 13.
I fell in love just looking at him.
He was so handsome.
A good-looking boy.
I was so proud to walk down the street with him.
He was so kind.
It's the war that changed him, all those terrible things that happened.
Now he's become irritable and seems to blame me for all that happened.
Who else can he blame?
But we can't complain.
We worked hard and now we're rich.
And my eldest son is happily married with three lovely children, thank God.
Two would have been enough.
And he lives in America.
He refuses to set foot in Germany.
So we went to visit.
He's a real scholar.
A professor.
But my husband's become irritable and fussy.
If one thing's out of place, he yells.
Over nothing at all.
And since it's just me in the house now - we let the maid go when the children left -
he yells at me.
But I forgive him.
I know it's not his fault.
And I'd rather he yell at me than sulk for days on end.
I know it makes him feel better.
But when I start to feel down... I think about the old days... how sweet he was and how proud I felt.
And I think of my children.
My son's a good boy, you know.
Intelligent.
He'd make you happy, and you know it.
You've known each other for so long, practically since you were babies.
There'd be no nasty surprises.
I remember your mother and I pushing our strollers together by the sea.
He's a very sensitive boy.
He'd make you happy.
And a girl should marry.
You'd have beautiful children.
And if you don't have time, I'll look after them.
I know how to raise children.
Whatever you do, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
No smoking.
Passport or ID.
They're reconfiguring the train.
They're uncoupling cars.
Are you going to Paris?
I'm stopping in Brussels first.
And you?
I'm going to Paris.
I see.
What time is it?
Half past ten.
I don't think smoking's allowed.
It is in the corridor.
The train's leaving.
You know Brussels?
That's where l was born.
I lived there for 20 years.
Twenty years?
I spent a week there two years ago.
I like it.
Were you still there then?
No, I left Brussels eight years ago.
Too bad.
Do you know my friends there by any chance, the Vanderlindens?
Don't they have a furniture store?
No, that's not them.
Then I don't know them.
They say Belgium's the land of plenty.
So they say.
Where do you live?
Paris.
I'm going to Paris too.
I'm going to live there because they say France is the land of freedom.
So they say.
Maybe I'll be happy there.
Maybe.
Anyway, you've got to live somewhere.
That's true.
I'm from Berlin.
After that I lived in Hamburg, because there's a port there.
You speak French well.
I always wanted to go to France.
They say that the French carry freedom in their hearts.
So I learned the language and even worked on my accent.
When I was young and on vacation in Spain... I fell in love with a French girl.
She corrected my mistakes.
When she stopped, I realized she didn't love me anymore.
The next morning I saw her talking to a Swedish boy... much stronger than me.
I'm going to stay at the Hôtel des Grands Hommes.
You know it?
I see.
I don't speak French as well as you yet.
I don't speak it that well.
When I left Hamburg... I went to South America.
Perhaps I was dreaming of justice... a grand and glorious thing.
I went from country to country:
Bolivia, Brazil, all over.
It's a strange climate - hot and humid.
I walked a lot... for days and nights on end.
I don't remember much:
gunfire, footsteps, noises, smells, a few words in Spanish.
I met a woman there.
This'll be my sixth country.
This time it will be the right one.
I'm sure of it.
Then I was in Greece.
On an island, practically alone.
That's all right for a while.
Then I returned home to Germany.
But I couldn't take it there either.
Then I remembered France.
Maybe I'll meet a woman there... whom I'll love and who'll love me.
We're coming into Brussels.
You're a real woman now.
I have been for a long time.
You're pale and fair.
You're beautiful.
You have my mother's eyes.
Look at me.
I wish I looked like you.
I miss you.
I have no one to talk to.
But you never talked to me.
You never talked to me.
But you were there.
How's Daddy and my brother?
Your brother's still like a big kid.
And your father's not as strong as before, but he's okay.
But he's got me.
Of course.
And how are you?
A bit tired from so much traveling.
is there no one to look after you?
If you're tired, come home with me.
No, let's stay here a little longer.
As you wish.
But we can't sleep here in this booth.
Let's get a room, shall we?
Your father will be worried.
But he's probably fallen asleep and won't wake up.
He had a long day, as usual.
is business going well?
I don't like to talk to you about these things, but now you'd understand.
No, it's not going well.
It's the recession.
It's hit us very hard.
I mean, it's hit everyone, but we're losing everything we've worked for for 30 years.
Sometimes you wonder if it was all worth it.
Your father's very discouraged.
One moment he says it'll pass and we just have to hold on, and the next he asks, "What's the point?"
He sighs and becomes withdrawn.
I try to boost his confidence.
I smile at him.
Sometimes it works and sometimes he doesn't even notice.
His gaze is turned inward... seeing God knows what.
How are things in Germany these days?
Germany?
There are curtains everywhere, and tulips on every table.
And as a friend of mine says, it's full of Germans.
It's true.
It's full of Germans.
I haven't been there in over 20 years.
It's probably full of opportunity now.
Maybe. I don't know.
Anyway... ln any case, things will get better.
We have to be strong and keep our hopes up.
And you're doing very well, so all the rest doesn't matter.
I follow your career very closely, you know.
I read all the papers and keep all the articles.
I have some in my bag.
Want to see them?
They make me feel better.
Mama, you've been in Belgium so long, yet you still have an accent.
Everyone tells me I have a good French accent.
Shall we go?
Would you have a room?
- One?
It doesn't have a bathroom.
All right.
Follow me, please.
Shall we go to sleep?
Aren't you going to undress?
Let me just look at you.
How long's it been?
Almost three years.
A long time.
Yes, but you were always with me.
I won't always be.
Yes, you will.
I have to make a call to Italy.
There's no phone here.
Who would you call?
A girlfriend.
How's Pierre?
We stopped seeing each other.
Why?
I was never there.
He was always waiting for me.
One day he'd had enough.
Shall I turn off the light?
So tell me.
I travel all over, you know, showing my films.
I meet all kinds of people.
I often end up all alone at night in my hotel room.
So sometimes I bring someone back with me.
But it's always sad and a bit silly, actually.
But she came to see me at my hotel because she'd liked the film.
We went out for a drink.
She told me about herself and I told her about myself.
The bar was closing, so we went to another one.
We kept on talking... and then that bar closed too.
We looked for another one.
Everything seemed closed.
The city was deserted.
We didn't want to say good-bye.
So she came up to my room.
We were tired.
We lay down on the bed... and kept talking.
We happened to brush against each other.
Then we kissed.
I don't know how it happened.
I felt sort of nauseous.
I felt sick.
It was too much.
I was confused.
But we kept on kissing.
And then it all became very easy.
I let myself go.
It felt good.
I never imagined it could be like that with a woman.
I had no idea.
We stayed together all night.
And for some strange reason, I thought of you.
I even told her so.
What did she say?
She smiled.
And then?
Nothing.
I had to leave the next day.
Have you seen her since?
We talk on the phone.
I wouldn't dare tell your father.
Don't tell him.
Have you ever loved a woman?
I don't know.
I've never thought about it.
Are you asleep?
Me neither.
You smell nice.
Still the same perfume.
I've worn it a long time.
As long as I can remember.
Sometimes you'd dab me with it before you went out for the evening.
You'd wear that long dress and put your hair up.
You'd ask me to button you up in back.
You couldn't reach.
You were such a well-behaved child.
When we'd go out, you'd say...
"Have a good time."
And when we got back late at night... you'd be lying wide awake... in your bed.
Anna, tell me you love me.
I love you.
Daniel, did you get a haircut?
Now I look even worse than before.
Aren't you exhausted?
You?
Oh, you know me.
What's wrong?
Just the usual grind.
Lots of work.
Are you hungry?
I don't know.
There's nothing at my place.
And I can't stand my place.
I'm thinking of moving.
Yes, your place is dreary.
I'm gonna get a bigger place.
That way if I ever have kids...
You're planning to have kids?
No, not especially.
I was just saying.
Forget I said it.
Maybe you want to be alone.
But we're driving around aimlessly.
Let's find a hotel and eat there.
I want you.
is this a new shirt?
No, a very old one I never wear.
It looks good on you.
Do it some more.
What do you see in the street?
Cars.
Lots of them?
I'm going to take a bath.
You're going to wash?
Why?
Hello?
What can we get to eat?
All right.
For two, please.
is the bathroom floor tiled?
Why?
Just asking.
I almost quit three times this week.
It's like tilting at windmills.
And for what?
You're born, you eat, you drink, you screw when you can, you die.
Come in.
I saw a plane.
There's air-conditioning.
Ah, breakfast. 7:30.
No, 8:00, please.
For a moment I was afraid they'd found me.
But that's impossible.
You never know.
You're an important man.
Important!
We can't affect what happens.
We're just carried along by the current.
You know, Anne... sometimes I think... I should stop paying the rent and the phone bill... and just vanish.
But I can't stop working.
If I stop for a day, like on Sundays, I get dizzy.
You march on or you die.
If I were a woman... know what I'd do?
I'd get pregnant... and forget everything else.
I'd go... I don't know, somewhere else... live close to nature breast-feed my kid every two hours.
- Every three hours at first.
- Fine.
Every three hours.
But then I think I should try to fix things, a better life and all that.
But if you ask what a better life would be, I can't even imagine it.
It's not just about food for everyone.
We know that's not it... though that would be a start.
You know... I think things will keep getting worse... that the price of milk and honey, the price of happiness... will get so high that something will happen.
It can't go on like this.
I'm always telling myself that.
Especially when I'm shaving.
With the buzz of the razor... I can shut everything else out... and ideas fill my head.
Everything moves so quickly.
Something's going to happen, something good.
I don't know what I'm saying.
Something good!
People will... listen to music, for example.
What's lovelier than music than a woman's voice?
Where does a woman's voice come from?
Will you sing for me?
I sing off-key.
You always said you wanted to be a singer.
What should I sing?
Whatever you like.
I wash the dishes Fix coffee with cream I'm so busy Have no time to dream
I work all day In this cheap little place
Flowers on the table Curtains of lace
Young lovers come here Holding hands
Wide-eyed, hopeful They make no demands
They bring in the sun My life they enchant
A bed built for two ls all they want I can't forget How happy they seem
Joy on their faces, Smiles that beam
When I think of them In that sad little room lt chases away My workaday gloom
Faces that shine Like rays of the sun
So bright that it hurts
So bright that it hurts I wash the dishes Fix coffee with cream
I'm so busy Have no time to dream I work all day ln this cheap little place
That's where they found them Face to face
Lying together Still holding hands
Dreaming of oceans And golden sands
They were buried in the city Side by side
Even the earth Their joy could not hide
When I think of them In that sad little room lt chases away My workaday gloom
Lovers for a day Faces that shine
Like rays of the sun Like rays of the sun
A little sunshine Can be so bright
So bright that it hurts
So bright that it hurts I wash the dishes Fix coffee with cream
I'm too busy Have no time to dream I work all day In this cheap little place
Flowers on the table Curtains of lace
That was beautiful.
In a moment we'll make love... and then you'll be off again tomorrow.
And I'll be left wanting you more than ever.
Yes, but at 8:30 a.m you'll be back at work.
We have 6 1/2 hours left.
It's not much.
What if we just stay still?
Come lie on top of me.
You're shaking.
Suddenly I don't feel well.
Don't move.
You're shivering.
You've got a fever.
Wait. I'll be right back.
Do you have any medications?
No, I'm sorry.
Thank you anyway.
Turn over.
Don't do that.
I'm away for three days.
I'll be back Wednesday evening.
Anne, it's Michel.
See you at the café Friday at noon as planned.
Don't forget.
See you then.
It's Hélène.
I just got in.
Call me when you get back - 57B-11-72.
I hope everything's okay.
I'll be here until Friday, and then I go home.
I hope we don't miss each other this time. I've got lots to tell you -
It's me.
Anne, this is Jean-Paul.
You need to attend these screenings:
Saturday in Lausanne,
Sunday in Geneva, Monday in Zurich.
You're booked for the 13th at the Hotel Terminus in Lausanne, the 14th at the Mondralin Geneva and the 15th at the Excelsior in Zurich.
See you soon.
This is Claire.
I'll call when you get back.
Or try calling me after 6:00 at 272-15-76.
See you soon.
That machine again!
This is Alain.
Today's my birthday.
I wanted to spend it with you.
Maybe next year.

Scholar Wei Zhengyuan of the Royal Cabinet, presents his son Wei Feng to Your Majesty.
Long live Your Majesty.
Rise.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Scholar Wei, does your son have any official capacity?
Majesty, my son is humble.
He is still studying.
- Does he know martial arts?
- A little.
Good.
Scholar Wei.
Your son has great talent.
He is well versed in both the pen and the sword.
I want Wei Feng to stay to discuss literature and martial arts.
You may leave.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Wei Feng!
At your orders.
A Mongol warrior and a Buddhist master are here.
Go and test their martial arts.
Yes.
Yes.
- Start with the Mongol warrior.
- Yes.
Good.
Your technique is awesome.
I am glad that you liked it.
Come here, Wei Feng.
Yes.
Wei Feng.
I am at your orders.
Wu Sangui is plotting against us.
Have you heard about it?
No.
I've been busy with my studies at home.
Per messenger, Wu is preparing an uprising with the help, from the followers of the late Ming regime.
They are just a bunch of bums!
Except for a clan.
Your Majesty, which clan?
The Tian clan in Qiping Province of Jiangbei district.
Their secret links with the rebel Wu cause me concern.
You should send the army to eliminate them.
I do not have sufficient evidence.
Sending the army hastily will alert them.
That is undesirable.
Your Majesty is insightful.
I'll send you to Qiping Province, to seek strong evidence of conspiracy.
I am not capable.
You're a man of both civil and military ability.
In addition, you are a Han.
You're the right person.
Your reward will match your success.
Majesty...
I...
- Here's my order:
- Yes.
I order you to go to Qiping Province immediately, to investigate the rebellion of Tian's family.
Come back soon and bring us your evidence.
Yes.
Wei Feng, you have a great responsibility.
If you do not return in three months, your father will be demoted.
If you do not return in six months, the whole family will be thrown in jail.
If you do not return in one year, they will be executed.
tian'S TOWN
five SUN MANOR
- Sir, please leave now.
- In all my career,
- I've never seen a girl so naughty.
- Forget it.
My teaching is impeccable.
It is unreasonable!
She's so naughty.
- Sir, do not insist.
- No way.
I need to clarify with her.
This is my reputation.
I think you should not teach anymore.
Go home and wait for death.
How disrespectful to your teacher!
You do not study and in addition, you want to hit me.
That is not hit.
Over the years, your legs have softened.
I barely bump against you and you stumble.
And that is not hit?
Go away or I start!
Go away.
You deserve to be beaten up.
I deserve it?
Why?
- You're a teacher?
- Yes.
Hitting a teacher!
Confucius will return from his grave.
Forget Confucius.
Talk about you first.
- You teach her to be good.
- Yes.
It's not her fault if you have failed.
How?
You...
She becomes so fierce, that she wants to hit you.
What did you say?
Your failure is obvious.
You have not taught well.
You're ruining the children of others.
Does he deserve to be beaten?
Nonsense.
Master, do not insist.
- Let it go.
- I give up.
I have no luck.
Hey, your umbrella!
- Old man, go home.
- Bad luck.
Hey.
What's your name?
Wei, Wei Feng.
What a strange and long name!
Not at all, it's Wei Feng.
Wei Feng?
OK.
Why did you repeat Wei?
It is an elegant way.
You won't understand.
Why don't you ask mine?
What is it?
My name is Zhizhi.
Tian, Tian Zhizhi.
They say a lady at the manor has a bad temper.
Is this you?
Who said that?
I'll slap him.
Whatever.
The teacher who just went away, should be the eighteenth, right?
I don't like him.
That's not a reason to hit him.
You say one more word and I will hit you, too.
You won't.
I won't?
I'm not your teacher.
Why do you hit me?
Be a little more courteous to me.
Hey!
Have you ever studied?
So, I hire you as my teacher.
Do you agree?
I refuse.
Wei Feng, why do you refuse?
You do not respect me.
If you want me to be your teacher, you should call me Mr. Wei.
No way.
Then I won't teach you.
Chubby!
You...
Do you agree?
No.
Good.
I have my own rule.
If you refuse to teach me, I will hit you three times.
Then...
Hop like me and leave the manor.
Mr. Wei, I advise you to stay.
No!
Mr. Wei...
please be my teacher.
OK, if you decide to be polite, respect me, obey me, study hard and...
Can't hit the teacher, right?
flying DRAGON
Uncle Zhong, I found another teacher.
- You're...
- Teacher Wei.
Uncle Zhong, where is my mother?
Zhizhi!
Do not bother Uncle Zhong.
You should be studying.
Mom.
Aunt.
Mom, I've found a new teacher.
A new teacher?
How about Mr. Wang?
The old man was useless.
I've chased him away.
Zhizhi, you're always naughty.
Grandpa will be angry.
Grandpa?
I'll explain to him.
He won't be angry at me.
Teacher Wei, this is my mother and my aunt.
I'm Wei Feng.
The old master arrives.
The main temple has been restored.
Harvest in the south is good.
Grandpa!
Good morning.
Good morning, third uncle, fourth uncle.
Grandpa.
Grandpa, take the tea.
Mr. Wei.
Five Sun Manor is a family of notables.
You'll be treated well.
Thank you, old master.
But our rules are strict.
You cannot move beyond the study room, and the backyard.
Especially near the side yard, you are prohibited to go there.
- I understand.
- Tian Zhong!
- Take him inside.
- Yes.
Grandpa, I accompany him.
- Zhizhi!
- Zhizhi!
Please.
Old master, you spoil her.
Dad, isn't this teacher a little too young?
Yes.
Zhizhi is so young and inexperienced.
I fear that...
I know.
Her previous teachers were older.
I hope this young teacher will finally succeed.
CROUCHlNG tiger
This is the reading room for third uncle.
Why is there a weapon rack?
Uncle practices martial arts when he has time.
Please.
phoenix DANCE
Phoenix Dance?
My mother and aunt live there.
Mr. Wei, please follow me.
GALLOPlNG HORSE
This is probably where the fourth uncle lives.
Mr. Wei, this way please.
OK.
Mr. Wei.
The meditation room of the master is at this side yard.
- And on this side...
- This is the study room.
Mr. Wei.
Please enter.
Uncle Zhong, you guys can go.
I keep my teacher company.
Miss, we are leaving.
Hey, Teacher Wei.
Watch when you walk.
You might fall into the water.
Please.
And then...
I almost forgot to tell you,
- I usually play there.
- Good.
Here's where I practice martial arts.
Miss, you want to hit me already?
Here's where you sleep.
And here is where you teach me.
Let's see how you teach me.
Open the book and repeat after me.
"Mencius bowed before the king."
"Mencius bowed before the king."
"The king said..."
"The king said..."
"'You have come from afar."
Why don't you repeat after me?
Look at the book, not me.
You're very strange.
Strange?
- What do you mean?
- You...
- You're not like them.
- Who?
The eighteen teachers I chased away.
That means that I am the nineteenth.
Repeat after me.
"The king said, You have come from afar."
"The king said, You have come from afar."
"Your visit will be beneficial to my country?"
"Your visit will be beneficial to my country?"
"Mencius said, My king, why did you say so?"
- Hey, teacher.
- Don't practice martial arts now.
Why not?
Come here.
I'll teach you.
I'm here to teach you to read, not practice martial arts.
Miss, are you going to kill me?
Hey, get up.
Your grandpa wants you to study, but not practicing martial arts.
Yes.
But martial arts give you strength.
Thanks to martial arts,
I could chase away those eighteen idiots.
Miss, you should know that reading books is even better for you.
For example?
You can acquire wisdom, understand things learn courtesy, filial piety, friendship, loyalty to your country.
This is called, "Loyalty, filial piety, humanity, courtesy and integrity."
You cannot fight with it.
So, you think your martial arts are great, and fantastic?
All right.
Come here.
OK.
Come on.
We do not fight.
We compare our strengths.
We compare our strengths?
Can you throw this leaf, to the other side of the bridge?
Piece of cake.
You couldn't even throw a leaf over there?
Where is your strength?
You're not convinced?
Your turn!
That's cheating!
I put the bamboo leaf on a twig.
No need to throw hard.
Are you convinced now?
I understand your ruse.
The wind can push the leaf.
But if it makes it heavier,
It can be shot like an arrow.
Exactly.
You should study hard to be intelligent.
All right.
Let's return to study.
Otherwise, your grandpa will scold you.
Don't worry.
He loves me.
It is he who taught me martial arts.
Your grandpa knows martial arts, too?
- What style?
- The shadow style.
The shadow style?
Is it what you just showed me?
No, it's like that.
Whoever gets captured by grandpa can no longer be free.
That is the shadow style.
It's this powerful?
I only know a little bit.
Your whole family practices the shadow style?
No.
Grandpa told me that besides him, there is only one other person who knows this style.
His name is Deng Nangshan.
What are you thinking?
You want to continue?
I was thinking about your writing class.
Let's go.
My writing class?
Continue.
Write like me.
Smaller.
Show me.
Do not move when writing.
You need to concentrate.
Try it.
No.
Hold the brush like that.
Straighten up.
Look.
The hand must be flexible.
Relax it.
Look and write.
Miss, come read.
Enough of practicing martial arts.
I don't like reading.
I prefer to write.
OK.
Come in.
If you do not return in three months, your father will be demoted.
If you do not return in six months, the whole family will be thrown in jail.
If you do not return in one year, they will be executed.
Mr. Wei.
You OK?
I'm fine.
The moon is so beautiful.
I went out for a walk.
Have I hurt you?
Mr. Wei, good night.
Uncle Zhong, good night.
Grandpa!
Zhizhi.
I have something to tell you.
What is it?
Your teacher is disingenuous.
I have to kill him.
Kill Wei Feng?
Grandpa!
He is a stooge of the Qing regime.
I don't understand.
Zhizhi.
At this point I'll tell you the truth.
The Five Sun Manor is a rebel group, aiming at restoring the Ming regime.
Each month, at the night of the full moon a messenger of Wu Sangui will visit us.
He brings us the fund to prepare our troops, and the list of other branches.
Wei Feng is probably a spy serving the Qing regime.
Tian Zhong has discovered that.
This man must be eliminated.
No!
He is not a spy.
Zhizhi.
You're young.
You don't understand.
Let your grandpa handle it.
No!
I will not let you kill him.
Mother, please beg for me.
Do not kill him.
Old master, this case...
Grandpa.
Zhizhi.
This is about the survival of our cause.
We must do it.
Grandpa, grandpa, don't kill him.
Zhizhi, if we don't kill him, one day, he will kill you and us.
He doesn't know martial arts.
How does he kill us?
The Qing emperor doesn't know martial arts either.
That did not prevent him from crushing the rebel forces.
No matter what you say...
Grandpa, you can't kill Wei Feng.
Why?
Because...
I'm in love with him.
I thought so.
Your personal love has blinded you of righteousness.
Grandpa...
Even if you're in love with him, eventually you'll forget him.
No, I will not forget him because...
Because why?
I...
Speak.
OK.
If you kill him, you kill my husband.
Your husband?
Zhizhi, are you and him...
That's why you have to spare him.
Zhizhi, you're not sensible.
You really did that?
Grandpa, inside the study room...
I've been alone with...
Say no more.
You...
If he is really the stooge of the Qing regime, I cannot save him.
- Right.
- Right.
He must be killed!
Grandpa, if you must kill him kill me too!
Zhizhi, weep no more.
I let him live.
But he must marry you, and cannot leave this manor.
Can you guarantee me?
Yes, he will accept.
Grandpa, I'll tell him.
- Prepare the wedding.
- OK.
The bridegroom offers tea to the old master.
The bride offers tea to the old master.
Grandpa.
Younger sister-in-law, put this on for Zhizhi.
Zhizhi, I offer this Golden necklace.
I hope that you and Wei Feng, will stay in the Five Sun Manor forever.
Kneel!
Imperial Decree.
By order of His Majesty,
Wei Zhengyuan is removed from his title and becomes an ordinary citizen.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
What happened to Wei Feng?
Commissioner, what is the motive?
Order of the Emperor.
According to this letter, this fall, Commander Wu, will redeploy troops in the North and South.
Yes.
Here's the new list of names.
Master, please take great care.
- Bao Gang.
- Yes.
Hide this list.
- Sit down.
- Please.
Please reply to Commander Wu, that we await his orders.
Where did you go at night?
I walked a little.
You cannot sleep?
I thought about my parents.
I've been here more than four months.
I'm homesick.
Homesick?
But this is your home now.
I know, but I cannot forget my parents.
I want to see them.
Zhizhi, will you go with me?
Leave?
Grandpa will not allow that.
Not really.
Grandpa is a man of principle.
He would not oppose that you see your in-laws.
Zhizhi, promise me to ask him.
By order of His Majesty,
Wei Zhengyuan shall be thrown in jail.
His family will be imprisoned with him.
- Such is the decree.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
Old master.
- Take them!
- Yes.
Zhizhi!
It's been almost two months.
How is it?
What?
Going home with me.
I forgot.
How could you forget?
I shall ask him next time.
There is no need for you to ask.
I'll go ask myself.
Wei Feng!
Wei Feng!
Grandpa, I want to talk.
I...
I would like to...
What?
Just say it.
I have left my family over six months.
My parents are not yet aware of my marriage.
- So...
- Your parents?
- Where are they?
- In the capital.
And you want to go home, right?
Yes.
I want to go home with Zhizhi.
We shall bow before the ancestors, see my parents, and...
- Do you really want to go?
- Yes, grandpa.
Do not worry.
We'll be back soon.
OK.
You should be.
Wei Feng, when do you leave?
As soon as possible.
How about tomorrow?
OK.
After you have bowed before the ancestors, there will be a farewell meal.
Thank you.
I'll tell Zhizhi.
Zhizhi, you can't even handle this trifle!
Did you talk to Grandpa?
He accepted immediately.
After bowing before the ancestors, there will be a farewell meal.
That is what he said?
Zhizhi, what's wrong with you?
Zhizhi, do not cry.
I'll take you to see my parents.
We will be back soon.
Wei Feng, you do not understand.
Grandpa will never let you leave the manor alive.
Why?
He was pretty cordial.
Didn't he say bowing before the ancestors?
That means that you must pass five tests.
The farewell meal means he wants to kill you!
Zhizhi, what should we do now?
Whether you go or stay, you're doomed.
We will live or die together as husband and wife.
Zhizhi, I...
We'll take them by surprise and escape tonight.
Escape?
You mean...
Quick.
Change your clothes.
Change?
You'll run faster in more comfortable clothes.
Old master, Zhizhi loves Wei Feng so much.
I'm afraid she will follow him.
And then...
I hope she will remember the rules of our family.
But if she goes with him, what shall we do?
We apply our rules.
- Strings?
- To climb the wall.
This shield will protect you.
If someone is going to stop us.
who is gonna be the first?
Uncle Zhong.
Tian Zhong?
- Uncle Zhong.
- Miss, Wei.
I am only doing my duty.
Uncle Zhong, can you let us pass?
Go quickly!
Wei Feng, come on!
Zhizhi, go quickly!
Uncle Zhong.
Young lady.
Wei, take care.
Wei Feng, you...
Wei Feng!
You're so good at martial arts.
Why did you lie to me?
I'll explain later.
- Fourth uncle must be here.
- Right.
He looks very nervous.
Nervous like a galloping horse.
He is very irritable.
Be careful.
His skills with sword are formidable.
But we can use his weakness to provoke him.
Once we have the opportunity, we can escape.
Let's separate.
Zhizhi, you really want to go with him?
A wife must follow her husband.
You don't even know that?
Insolent!
Zhizhi, a single man will not understand.
You know martial arts?
I just taught him.
Who would marry such a bad-tempered guy?
You can be a eunuch.
No way.
He is too impulsive.
Once he is, he'll no longer be temperamental.
Zhizhi, go quickly!
Go!
- Younger sister-in-law.
- Fourth uncle.
The Phoenix Dance room is ours.
I don't care.
Fourth uncle, respect the family rule.
Go home!
Thank you, aunt.
Thank you, mother.
Wei Feng, come on.
- Mother, you...
- You have not passed the test.
Mother, let us go.
Mother!
Move back!
Mother.
Zhizhi!
A dummy spike!
Thank you, mother.
These spikes are the idea of your aunt.
Thank you, aunt.
- Rise.
- Yes.
Zhizhi.
Your mother and I both know the pain of not having a husband.
Third uncle is in the next room.
You will not succeed in defeating his sword technique.
There is only one way.
Younger sister-in-law.
They can only pass his test with your help.
Sister, I...
If you do not help your daughter, who will?
Go.
Let's go.
Younger sister-in-law, you don't need to plead their case.
Third uncle, do me a favor.
Let them pass.
Zhizhi, I can let her go.
But Wei Feng must stay here.
You want to separate them?
They have to overcome the test at my Crouching Tiger room.
Third uncle, forgive the insolence of your niece.
Third uncle!
OK.
You've passed my test.
But there remains the old master.
I'm not afraid.
Mother will help us.
- Zhizhi, I...
- Mother!
Mother...
Beseech him for us.
OK.
Drop your weapons.
Third uncle, forgive us.
Let's go.
Grandpa.
Aren't you leaving tomorrow?
Grandpa, we will return.
When you come back, the Qing's minions will be all over the manor.
No.
Zhizhi, if you're the daughter of Tian's family, you shouldn't leave the manor.
Grandpa, I am the daughter of Tian's family, and Wei Feng is the son-in-law.
How could we hurt Tian's family?
Moreover...
I'm your favorite, grandpa.
That's why you should not go away.
Grandpa, I'll just visit my in-laws.
Remember.
When you were begging me to save Wei Feng, what have I said?
But Wei Feng is my husband.
Do you really want to go?
Grandpa, forgive my lack of filial piety.
You do not deserve to wear my jade.
Grandpa!
Old master!
Old master, I lost my husband a long time ago.
I have only Zhizhi.
She is your only granddaughter.
She will not hurt Tian's family with Wei Feng.
Please let them go.
Zhizhi is not my granddaughter.
Feng Wei is not our grandson-in-law.
- Take weapons.
- Grandpa!
Old master!
Come on!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
- Younger sister-in-law!
- Old master!
Let them go.
The shadow style!
Zhizhi!
Zhizhi!
Wei Feng, go quickly!
Wei Feng, go!
Go!
Go!
Zhizhi!
Guards!
Get him!
Hurry up!
Go, go, go!
Prepare horses!
Third brother, he must be hiding.
Shoot on sight.
Prepare your arrows.
Shoot!
Pursue him!
Why is he not surfacing?
He was shot by so many arrows.
He must be dead.
Let's go back.
Go back!
The shadow style!
Please.
Please.
Uncle Zhong.
Who are you?
Wei Feng!
I know the rule of Tian's family.
One must pass the tests to enter and exit.
Tell the old master!
Tell the old master.
Close all the doors!
Run!
Hello, third uncle.
You're not dead?
Take a weapon.
Are you always this irritable, fourth uncle?
Zhizhi was right.
You're like a real horse!
A horse?
More like a donkey!
Fourth uncle, use your best sword skills.
I didn't expect you'd come back.
I said I'd come back.
How many minions of the Qing regime did you bring with you?
None.
This time I come back to avenge the death of Zhizhi and her mother.
Revenge?
The affairs of Tian's family does not concern you.
Zhizhi was Wei's family member.
I do not recognize you as a son.
You have passed the dragon, tiger, phoenix and horse tests.
Now, what are you still waiting for?
Give me Zhizhi's jade medallion.
Her medallion is here.
Come get it.
I just wanted to try your shadow style.
Not bad.
What is this style?
It doesn't come from any school.
It's the mantis.
The secret list?
How come?
I infiltrated the Tian's family for this.
Scholar Wei.
You have raised your son well.
I offer this glass.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
All the credit goes the royal guard.
Honor him first.
Honor the scholar first.
- No!
- No, first...
The scholar first...
Both of you deserve that.
No precedence.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Your son honors your name.
Congratulations.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thanks to the Ming dynasty.
Father!
Wei Feng.
We serve the Qing regime, to wait for the opportunity to knock over the regime.
Father!
You killed the followers of the Ming dynasty.
You're an insult to my family.
I'd rather die.
Protect the Emperor, arrest them!
Protect the Emperor!
Stop it!
I have put poison in our glasses.
Now father and son will die to give thanks to the Ming dynasty.
Dad!
Scholar Wei, it was not necessary.
Barbarian, listen to me.
You can never kill all the Ming heroes who oppose the Qing regime.
[grunting]
My son Wei Fung comes to salute your highness.
- Greetings.
Long live the emperor.
- Long live the emperor.
- Arise.
- [both] Thank you, sire.
Scholar Wei, your son ever work?
No, Highness, he's a student.
Of various arts.
Oh, martial arts?
Yes, he can fight.
Good, Scholar Wei.
As it would seem, he has skill in many disciplines.
We may, perhaps, have use for him.
We'll discuss it.
So then, you may withdraw.
Sire, as you command.
Wei Fung?
Sire?
There's a priest here, and a Mongol fighter.
I've asked them to test your martial arts skill.
[Wei] Sire...
Sire.
Let the contest begin!
Sir.
[knuckles cracking]
[yelling]
[body hits ground]
[groaning]
[man] Good!
Very good technique.
Thank you for your praise, sire.
I am honored.
Wei Fung, come here.
Sire...
- Wei Fung.
- Yes, sire.
General Wu plans to overthrow me.
You've heard that?
I'm always absorbed in my studies.
I've heard nothing.
I hear he's plotting with the remnants of the Ming rebels.
I believe that.
Those few men have no strength.
But there is one clan that is well organized.
My Lord, which clan?
It's the Tien clan.
They are conspiring with Wu to commence a rebellion.
There is no doubt about it.
In that case, why not send troops?
[sighs]
Because before I attack, I want proof.
Lists and names of everybody.
You are wise, sire.
So I want you to go to Tien clan.
Spy on them and get the evidence.
I have no experience in such things.
[laughing]
But you are talented.
You can do it.
If there's anybody can, you can succeed.
You'll be rewarded.
My Lord, I...
- My orders.
- Sire.
You are to proceed to Chi Ping and get the proof of the Tiens' treachery.
When you have, you will report here at once.
Sire.
But still, if you fail after three months, then your father will be stripped of his posts.
After six months, your whole family will be jailed.
After a year, I will behead them!

No!
I've been a teacher now for years.
- But such a pupil?
- Teacher, you must go!
No respect?
I don't deserve that.
- Please.
- Not at my age.
Teacher, now you know what she's like.
- Now, come on.
- No, I won't go!
I must speak my mind!
Or else I'll never teach again!
I think you ought to give up teaching.
Just retire and enjoy your old age!
[exclaims]
You!
How dare you do that to me?
You wicked young girl!
You've no respect, beating up your own teacher!
Hey, I didn't hit you.
I just touched you.
Quite lightly.
[groaning]
But you're so weak, you can't stand up!
[laughing]
You...
You hit me again!
Go on, or I'll beat you!
Hey, go on.
You deserve this.
Deserved it?
But why is that?
- You're a teacher?
- Yes, I'm a teacher.
Oh, dear.
Would Confucius have lived so long
- if he had pupils like her?
- Forget Confucius.
Seems to me you've taught her right and wrong.
Of course.
But it still doesn't appear that she's learned.
- What?
- She's rude.
No respect.
She wants to hit you.
What was that?
That proves you taught badly.
You didn't do your job, at least not properly.
Tell me, you, do you think I'm right?
Huh?
Nonsense!
It was all her fault!
She wouldn't learn her lessons.
What could I do?
[grunting]
She's so arrogant!
Thank you!
Let's get out of here!
Come on!
Hey!
Take this!
[all clamoring]
Give me my umbrella.
Hey!
What's your name?
Tell me.
First Wei, then Fung.
That's a strange way to put it.
But accurate.
My name's Wei Fung.
So it's Wei Fung.
Why not just say so?
I say what I want.
- Always.
- Hey.
You haven't asked my name.
- Go on.
- My name's Chi-Chi.
My last name is Tien.
That's Tien Chi-Chi.
They say that you're the girl who's got the nasty temper.
[Wei] That right?
Who says?
I'll beat 'em up!
Doesn't matter.
Just now, that teacher that you threw out...
They say he's the 1 8th one.
Don't like him.
Even so, you shouldn't hit him.
You say that, I'll hit you!
- No you won't.
- Why not?
Hey!
I'm not your teacher.
So you can't.
Just behave yourself.
Hey, are you a teacher?
Well, then, I'll engage your services, all right?
No thanks.
Wei Fung, why not?
You've no respect.
You just called me Wei Fung instead of Teacher Wei.
Don't want to.
All right.
I'll go.
Fatty?
You'll teach me?
No.
Right.
If you refuse, then you'll be punched!
Three times!
And what's more you leave town hopping on one leg.
Teacher Wei, I think you should take the job.
I won't.
Hey, teacher, please teach me.
Right.
But always respect your teacher.
Be polite.
And listen to him.
And study hard.
Also...
Never hit teacher, right?
- [chuckles] Right.
- [giggling]
flying DRAGON
Uncle Chung, I've found a new teacher!
- This is...
- Teacher Wei.
Tell me, where's Ma?
Chi-Chi!
Don't bother your uncle.
Why aren't you studying?
Ma!
Grand Aunt!
Yes, I have a new teacher.
New teacher?
And Mr. Wong?
Old fool.
Useless.
Threw him out.
Chi-Chi, that was naughty.
When your granddad hears, he'll be mad.
Granddad?
No he won't.
I'll go and tell him now.
Hey...
Teacher Wei...
My mother, Grand Aunt.
How do you do?
[man] The master comes!
Repairs to the temple are completed.
Also, we should have a good harvest this year.
Granddad!
Good morning, uncles!
Good morning!
Granddad, listen... [no audio]
Granddad, have some tea.
Teacher Wei, the Tiens are a big clan.
You will be treated well here.
- Thank you, sir.
- Hmm.
But still, our clan rules are very strict.
Both the study and the gardens, these are open to you.
But anywhere else in this place you may not enter.
I see.
Tien Chung.
Take him inside.
Sir.
Granddad, I'll go too!
Chi-Chi...
Chi-Chi!
Please...
Father, you spoil her.
[chuckling]
Dad, that teacher...
He does seem a bit young.
Right.
Chi-Chi is so naive.
I'm scared.
Yes, I know.
He's younger than the others.
But they failed.
So maybe he can succeed.
I do hope so.
CROUCHlNG tiger
And this room is Uncle Tien's study.
Those weapons...
Are they all his?
He likes to practice martial arts.
- Oh.
- Please.
phoenix DANCE
- Feng Wu?
- My mother lives behind there.
Teacher, this way.
GALLOPlNG HORSE
These rooms belong to your fourth uncle?
Teacher, please.
Teacher Wei, that chamber adjoining the pond, that's reserved for the ladies.
- And this is...
- This is the study.
Teacher Wei, please go in.
Uncle Chung, you can go.
I'll take over.
All right, see you.
[grunting] [chuckles] Hey, teacher.
You have to be more careful.
If you're not, you'll fall in the water.
- Yeah.
- Please.
Also...
This place here, I use as my own playground.
Where I practice kung fu!
Listen, don't hit me!
- [giggles]
- Hey...
And this is your room here.
Hey, this desk is for us.
Now let's see how you're gonna teach me.
Open the book and repeat:
"Mencius went to see the king."
Mencius went to see the king.
"The king said..."
The king said...
"l am glad you came, sir."
You must repeat.
Just look at the book, not at me.
Hey, you're strange.
You know?
Strange?
In what way?
Because... you're different.
- From whom?
- The other teachers.
- The ones I threw out.
- Oh.
Well, perhaps I'll be better, too.
Let's go on.
"The king said, 'l am glad that you came, sir."'
The king said, "l am glad that you came, sir."
"lt may be that you can help me."
It may be that you can help me.
"Mencius said, 'What do you mean?"'
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey, teacher!
- Hey, no more boxing!
Why not?
One day I'll teach you.
You're to study, not to box.
[yelling]
- [groans] - [Chi-Chi giggling]
Miss, you'll kill me!
Hey, get up!
Hey, miss, your granddad, now, he wants you to learn and not to fight.
Well, sure, but still, if I hadn't practiced,
I wouldn't have developed enough strength to throw my teachers out.
Hey, listen, to learn does bring its advantages.
- Like what?
- Study increases your intelligence.
Also...
Hey!
...matures you.
Trains your mind.
You understand filial piety, things like clan etiquette, family, loyalty...
But still, it won't make you a fighter.
Well, you believe that you can fight real well.
That right?
Mmm...
Right.
Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Hey.
All I'll do is test your strength.
Strength?
Can you throw this leaf over the bridge?
Well, that's easy.
What's wrong?
It's quite light.
Can't you make it?
You beaten?
Let's see you do it.
And what does that prove?
Well, I threw over the leaf.
And some twig, too.
And without any strength.
You get it?
Oh!
I can see what you're getting at.
What you did is to use nature.
You used gravity, not your strength.
You used the natural forces!
Right, and things like that can be learned if you study.
All right.
Now, let's study before your grandpa comes.
Don't worry, he approves of kung fu.
In fact, he taught me all mine.
- Your granddad, he fights well?
- Mm.
What style?
It's called the Shadow Technique.
The Shadow Technique?
Just now, was that what you were using?
Oh, no, it's like... [grunting]
Ow!
Ah!
When anyone comes into Grandfather's hands they can never escape.
That's the technique that he's taught me.
It's good.
But I've only learned a little bit yet.
And your family, do they all know this style?
Oh, no, Granddad said, of all the clan, only I would be taught to use this technique.
Uh...
And cousin Tang, but he's in Han Wei.
Hey, what you thinking?
Well, tell me!
It's time that you could write.
Right.
I have to write?
I have to write?
Hey, come on.
Like me, smaller.
Well, you show me how, then.
Keep your mind on your work.
Take care.
Here.
Hey.
No.
Hold like this.
Hey, keep upright.
Watch that.
Come on, relax your hand.
- Relax.
Come on.
- [exclaims]
Come on.
Here.
Look at it.
Hey, miss.
Do some reading.
Stop boxing.
I don't want to read.
I want to write.
Right.
Come in then.
But after three months, your father will be stripped of all his posts.
After six months, your family will be put in jail.
After one year, they will be killed!
[grunting]
[groans]
Teacher!
Are you all right?
Sure.
It seemed like such a beautiful night.
I thought I'd stroll...
Are you hurt?
All right.
Night.
Mr. Chung.
Goodnight.
Granddad?
Chi-Chi.
I asked you here to tell you something.
What's that?
Your teacher means us harm.
He must die.
Not Wei Fung!
Granddad!
He is a Ching agent.
I don't get it.
Chi-Chi...
It's time you knew the truth.
You're old enough now.
This clan... is headquarters... of the anti-Ching movement.
That man who comes here each month...
He's our contact with the rebels.
And he brings us all the stuff to equip the militia units and the lists of the new recruits.
Wei Fung has been sent here by the Chings to spy on us.
Tien Chung investigated his background.
He means to destroy our clan!
Can't be!
He can't be a spy!
Chi-Chi...
You're too young.
And too inexperienced.
I shall take care of him.
No, you can't kill him!
Ma, don't let them do it!
Don't let them!
Master...
This thing... [sobbing] Granddad!
Chi-Chi...
The fate of our movement depends on this.
We must do it.
Granddad...
Granddad, please don't kill him!
Chi-Chi, but if we don't then he'll kill us.
Each one of us.
He can't fight.
How could he?
The Manchu king, he can't fight.
But even so, he's ordered many deaths.
I don't care!
Granddad, don't kill him!
Why not?
Because...
I...
Iove the man.
A good reason.
But not worth a whole nation.
- Not one man.
- Granddad!
You'll soon forget him.
I know that.
There'll be others.
No, I won't forget him!
- Because...
- Because what?
I...
I...
Speak!
All right!
You kill him then you'll kill my lover!
Lover?
Chi-Chi, you haven't...
Mm.
So you can't kill him!
Chi-Chi, you're so young!
How could you do this?
Granddad, so many hours we were alone.
That's enough!
You...!
Chi-Chi, if he really is a Ching agent, he has to go!
- Right!
- Right!
- He must die!
- He must die!
[sobbing]
Granddad, if you kill him then kill me as well!
[weeping]
All right, stop crying.
I will spare his life.
But still, he must live here as one of our family.
And he may never leave the village.
Can you insure that he'll agree?
Oh, yes, I'm sure he will!
Granddad, I'll go tell him!
- Prepare the wedding.
- [both] Yes!
- Prepare the wedding.
- [both] Yes!
[traditional music playing]
[woman] The groom offers Master the tea.
[woman] The bride offers Master the tea.
Granddad!
[laughing]
Thank you.
Here, put it on her.
Chi-Chi, the jade is a gift for you.
I hope you and Wei Fung will live here forever.
[man] Down on your knees!
Imperial orders!
By royal decree,
Wei Jing Yuan is stripped of his official posts!
Let all officials know this.
Thank you, sir.
Wei Fung, where is he?
Chamberlain, what's the reason?
It's the emperor's orders.
The message says General Wu has formed some new groups, in the south and in the north, too.
Yes.
There's the list of names.
My Lord, guard it well, sir.
Bao Jiang, look after this list.
- Sit.
- Thank you.
You tell General Wu we will await his orders.
Where are you going at this hour?
Just strolling.
To relax.
Can't sleep?
I was thinking of my parents.
I've been here nearly four months.
I miss my folks.
Your folks?
We're your folks now.
Right.
But still, I miss my parents.
I must go and see them.
Chi-Chi, will you come, too?
Go with you?
Granddad won't agree.
Why not?
He's a reasonable man.
And sympathetic.
He knows what a wife's duty should be.
Chi-Chi, go on.
Please, ask him.
The emperor's orders!
Wei Jing Yuan and his family are to be imprisoned immediately!
- Arrest them!
- [man] Thank you, sir.
Husband!
[crying]
Take them away!
Chi-Chi...
It's been two months, what's happening?
On what?
On our trip!
I forgot!
What's that?
You forgot?
I'll ask soon.
No need, I'll ask him.
Wei Fung!
Wei Fung!
Granddad, I want to ask you something.
I...
I want...
Well, what is it?
Tell me.
Granddad, I left home six months ago.
My parents must be worried.
Don't know where I am.
So then...
Parents?
Where do they live?
The capitol.
Hmm.
And so you want to leave?
- That right?
- Yes, and take Chi-Chi with me.
See my home, meet my parents.
Also, I...
You sure?
Sure I am.
I won't be long.
Just a few days.
No longer.
All right.
You are to go.
Tell me, when will you leave?
Soon as I can.
I think...
Well, tomorrow?
Right.
Go on.
Pack your things and we'll see you off.
Thank you, sir!
I'll tell Chi-Chi.
Chi-Chi, I told you.
There wasn't any problem.
You asked him?
Sure, and he agreed.
He said that he'd come and see me off.
- Tomorrow morning.
- He said that?
Mm-hm.
Chi-Chi, what's wrong?
[crying softly]
Listen, darling, I'll take you and meet my parents.
And then we'll come straight back.
Wei Fung, you don't understand!
I don't care what he said.
He won't let you leave alive!
That can't be!
Your granddad was most polite.
Well, he intends...
You must pass the five posts.
He knows that way you're bound to die.
One thing is sure...
He's going to kill you!
[Chi-Chi crying]
Chi-Chi, what are we gonna do?
It's simple.
There's no choice.
You're my husband.
We live or die together.
Chi-Chi, I...
Now then, we must break out tonight.
- Our only hope!
- Tonight?
- You sure?
- I am.
Change your clothes.
Why?
They're lighter.
Won't slow us down.
My Lord, Chi-Chi loves Wei Fung.
I'm scared.
She'll go with him.
Then what?
Well, she knows our clan rules.
I shall remind her.
What happens if she insists?
What then?
Then she will have to be punished!
- Why the rope?
- To get over the wall.
You take the rattan shield.
Now, the first post.
Who's on that?
- Uncle Chung.
- Tien Chung?
Uncle Chung.
I am sorry.
This is my duty.
I must do it.
Uncle Chung, couldn't you help us out?
[yelling]
- [Chi-Chi] Get out!
- Right!
- Go on!
- All right!
Chi-Chi, come on!
Let's go!
Uncle Chung.
Mistress.
Master.
Take care.
Wei Fung...
Wei Fung!
Why didn't you say you knew kung fu?
I'll tell you later.
- Next one is fourth uncle?
- Right.
He seems a bit impatient.
He's like an angry horse.
And vicious, too.
You must watch him.
Be careful.
His swordplay's terrific.
So then we'll try and hold him off long as we can, then escape through the courtyard.
Come along!
Chi-Chi, you'll really go with him?
He is my husband.
It's my duty.
But still, you wouldn't know that.
Damn you!
Chi-Chi, he is a bachelor.
They don't know too much.
When did you learn to fight?
When he started taking some lessons from me.
No girl would marry that bad temper!
It's all right, we'll fix that!
Don't think he can change.
Make him a eunuch.
[grunting]
Chi-Chi, run now!
Right!
Hurry!
[grunts]
- Sister!
- Brother.
Withdraw.
We shall handle this.
I won't!
Listen.
It's our business now.
Please withdraw.
Thank you, both!
Thank you!
- Wei Fung, let's go!
- Hi-ya!
Ma!
You forget.
It's my post.
Ma, please let us go!
Ma!
Move back!
Ma!
[gasps]
Chi-Chi!
It's wax!
Thank you very much, Mother!
Don't thank me.
It was your great aunt's idea.
Thank you, Aunt!
You get up.
Yes.
Chi-Chi...
We both have known what it's like to lose a husband.
But we're afraid you won't get through.
The next post is very tough.
Only one way.
Hsang...
You must help them.
Or they will lose.
- Help them?
How?
- She is your daughter.
If you don't, then who will?
Go on.
Let's go.
Sister, please don't plead for them.
Brother, for my sake, please let them through.
Chi-Chi, she can pass through.
But as for Wei Fung, well, he stays.
You know they won't agree to that.
Well, in that case, they're gonna have to fight their way through.
Uncle, excuse me!
[grunts]
[grunts]
- Run!
- Uncle!
Right, you can pass by me but still, not your granddad.
We'll see.
My ma will help us.
- Chi-Chi, I...
- Ma?
Ma, please, try and intercede for us.
Right, drop the arms.
Brother, excuse us.
Come.
[Chi-Chi] Granddad...
I thought you told me you'd leave tomorrow.
Granddad, we will be back.
When you come back our village here will be surrounded by Ching troops.
You're wrong!
Chi-Chi, now, you belong to the Tiens.
You shouldn't leave us like this.
Granddad, I am a Tien.
But so is Wei Fung now.
We wouldn't harm the clan.
Besides...
Granddad, you love me!
Well, in that case, you shouldn't leave like this.
Granddad...
All we want is to go and see his parents.
Listen, remember what I said when I spared him.
And you agreed!
But still...
Wei Fung is my husband.
You insist on this?
Granddad, forgive me!
You...!
You're not fit to wear that!
Granddad!
Master!
Master, since I'm a widow I know just what Chi-Chi's feeling.
Remember, she is your granddaughter.
I'm sure she and Wei Fung wouldn't harm the Tiens.
I beg of you.
Let them leave!
- [grunts] - [cries out]
She's not my grandchild!
And he isn't my grandson-in-law!
Take your weapon!
Oh, Granddad!
Master!
Quick!

- Bring the archers.
- Archers!
Kill!
Get him!

Where's the body?
It hasn't come up yet.
Anyway, he must be dead.
Let's go.
Come on!

Wei Fung!
I know what the Tien clan rules are.
So I came back, as I promised.
You tell your master.
Tell the master!
And lock the gates!
[both whimpering]
Well, now.
- How's things?
- You're not dead!
Take a weapon.
[groans] [yells]
[gasping]
[grunts]
Well, now, you're just the same.
Still so bad-tempered.
Chi-Chi was right.
You are just like a horse.
Well, here's the mule, rolling on the ground!
[yelling]
All right.
Now, do your best!
Exert your strength.
[groans] [gasping]
Who would have thought that you'd come back?
I promised.
I said that I would.
Well, now...
How many Ching men have you brought with you?
None.
I've come here to avenge Chi-Chi and her mother.
Avenge what?
That's Tien's affair!
And not yours!
But Chi-Chi was a Wei!
I don't recognize the marriage because there's no blood relation of mine would ever marry a Ching traitor!
Well, now, why are you waiting?
I want Chi-Chi's pendant!
Is that a fact?
Come and get it, if you can.
Right.
I'm very interested to test your skill.
Not bad.
What's that style?
It's new.
It's mine.
Mantis.
[Tien groans]
The list!
But how?
The reason I came... was to get this.
[screams]
[gasping]
Scholar Wei, you taught him well.
I drink to you.
Thank you, sir.
My Lord, the credit in all of this business should go to my son.
Please reward him first.
Highness, my father comes first.
- No, he comes first.
- No, he does...
- He comes first.
- You are both a credit to us.
- Father and son.
- [both] Sir.
Scholar Wei, you have a fine son there.
- Does you credit.
- Thank you.
- Long live the Ming!
- Dad!
Wei Fung...
We yielded to these Chings only to oppose them!
And throw them out!
Dad!
But you have killed a Ming hero!
You're a disgrace to all of our family!
You must die, you damn traitor!
Get him!
[all shouting]
Stop this!
I've poisoned both our drinks!
So then... we... [gasping] We will all die together!
- That way, the Mings will...
- Dad!
[groaning]
Scholar Wei, why did you do it?
Tyrant!
I tell you...
No matter what you do...
You'll never kill all the heroes!
[gasping]
The royal scholar Wai Jing Yuan and son Wai Fung ... greet your highness.
Long live the king
Rise
Thank you, your highness
Scholar, has your son ever been an official?
Your highness, my humble son ... is still studying
He does know some kung fu though
That's good
Your son is a man of talents
I'm sure he can handle the pen as well as the sword
I want to retain him... to study books and kung fu
Scholar, please leave us
Yes, your highness
Wai Fung
Yes, your highness
In front of the royal palace, Shin Kwai Camp a Mongolian hero and a senior monk have arrived
Go and test their kung fu
Yes, your highness
Yes, your highness
Start with the Mongolian fighter
Yes, your highness
Good, great skill
I'm honoured my humble skills have pleased you
Wai Fung, come to me
Yes, your highness
Wai Fung
Here, your highness
Ng San Kwai has devious intentions;
Have you heard about it?
I've been cloistered in my studies so I haven't heard
Wai Lit is contacting fighters loyal to last regime ... and might cause a rebellion
They are rebels and desperate men
However, there is a clan ... who are not rebels
Your highness, which group is this?
The Tiens live around Jiang Bei... and have been communicating secretly with Wu Lit
It's a powerful rebel group and can cause trouble
If they're planning a revolt, we should suppress it ... but I have no proof
And to send in soldiers like this... it'd alarm them and create negative effect
Your highness is wise
I am sending you to Jiang Bei ... to find out more and get proof
I am a mere humble servant and may not deliver
You are a scholar and soldier, and a Han
So you're the ideal person
If you accomplish the task, you'll be rewarded
Your highness, I...
Receive my decree
Yes, your highness
I command you to set forth to Qiping Province and investigate if the Tien people will rebel
After that, return to me with a full report
Yes, your highness
You have a great responsibility
If you don't return in 3 months... your father will be degraded to a civilian;
Past 6 months, your family will be jailed past 1 year, your family will be slaughtered
You...
Old sir
Having taught so many years...
I've never seen such a mischievous girl
It's unreasonable
Let's leave!
I haven't taught anything wrong she threw away the rice bowl herself
Old sir, don't teach anymore
No way
It's imminent that I clarify
Otherwise how can I continue to teach
I think you needn't teach anymore
Go home and wait for your time to die!
How disrespectful!
You unreasonable girl you dare to discard your studies and hit your teacher
That's not hitting.
You're old... and clumsy
Just a light bump and you fell
This is beating me up
I'll hit you if you don't go
Go, you deserve a beating
What's the reasoning behind this?
Are you a teacher?
Of course, but now even a teacher has to be beaten up
Confucius will turn in his grave...
You dare mention Confucius?
Firstly talk about yourself
You teach her so that she'll be good
Yes
But you haven't taught her well ... so how can she be good?
What?
You...
She's so fierce
What's more she even wants to beat you up
What are you saying?
That proves you haven't done your job and you're ruining other peoples' children
So, don't you think he should be beaten?
That's nonsense
Old sir, forget it
How ridiculous!
Forget it
Just my luck
Hey, take back your umbrella
And this, too
Old sir, go back!
Hey
What's your name?
My first name is Fung, last name Wai
What a strange, long name
Not really, the full name is Wai Fung
What's the use of the other characters?
That's the literary way, you wouldn't understand
Hey, why don't you ask my name?
Say it!
I'm Gi Gi
My first middle name is Gi, and last name Tien
They say there's a naughty girl in Wu Yang Mansion
That should be you
Who said that?
I'll smack his lips
No one did
The teacher who was driven away ... must be the 1 8th already
I don't like him
Still you didn't have to hit him!
One more word and I'll hit you too
No you won't
I won't?
I'm not your teacher;
why would you hit me?
Watch your manners
Hey, have you ever studied?
I'll let you be my teacher, how's that?
No way
Why not?
If you want me to be your teacher ... you address me as Mr Wai
I won't
Then I'll not teach you
Little Fatty
You...
Will you teach?
No
Right, here are my rules
If you refuse, I'll give you 3 punches
And after that...
like me, leave the Tien mansion
Mr. Wai, you'd better stay behind to teach
No
Mr. Wai, be my teacher please
Okay, you should from now on be polite to your teacher
Respect your teacher, be attentive work hard, and...
Not to punch him, correct?
Uncle Chung, I've got a new teacher again
This is...
Mr. Wai
Uncle Chung, where's my mom?
Gi Gi, you are giving Uncle Chung trouble again
Why don't you stay in the room and study
Mom
Auntie
Mom, I've got a new teacher again
New teacher?
Where's Mr. Wong?
Useless old codger
He's been scared away by me
Gi Gi, you aren't listening
Your grandpa will be angry if he knew
Grandpa?
If I tell him, he won't be angry
Hey...
Teacher Wai
This is my mom; my auntie
I'm Wai Fung, at your service
Old Master is here
The Jun Shing Temple has already been renovated and harvest in the Southern Village is good
Grandpa
Good morning
Good morning, uncles
Grandpa
Grandpa, have some tea
Mr. Wai, ours is an affluent family
We won't treat you badly
Thank you, Master
But our family discipline is very strict too
Except for the study room, the backyard ... and beyond are off limits
You shouldn't go in, especially to the side garden
I understand
Yuen Chong
Bring him in
Yes
Grandpa, I'll go with him
Gi Gi, Gi Gi
Please
Master, you've spoilt her
Dad, isn't this teacher a bit too young
Yes, Gi Gi is young and inexperienced, I'm afraid...
I know
The previous ones were a bit old
I hope that this young one can teach her better
This place is where third uncle reads
How can there be weapons in a place of study?
Uncle practises kung fu during his leisure time
Please
Phoenix dance?
Mom and auntie live there
Mr. Wai, this way please
This Bun Ma Hall is possibly where Fourth Uncle lives
Mr. Wai, please
Mr. Wai, the other side leads to the side garden
It's where old master Tien retreats, that is...
That is the study
Mr. Wai, please
Uncle Chung, you go first
I'll stay with teacher
Miss, we're leaving
Mr. Wai
You'll have to watch your steps... otherwise you may fall into the water
Alright, alright
Please
Also
I almost forgot to tell you
That is where I used to play
This is where I practise kung fu
Miss, you're beating me up already
This is where you sleep
The lessons would be conducted here
Let's see how you're going to teach me
Open the book and read after me
Meng Zhi went to see Emperor Leung Wai
Meng Zhi went to see Emperor Leung Wai
Wang said
Wang said
You've come from far away
Why don't you repeat after me?
You should look at the book, not me
You are weird
Weird?
How so?
You're different from them
Who?
The 1 8 teachers whom I've scared away
So...
I'm the 1 9th
Recite after me
Emperor said you've come from far away
Emperor said you've come from far away
Will my country be at a disadvantage?
Will my country be at a disadvantage?
Meng Zhi said why speak of advantages?
Teacher
Don't practise kung fu now
Why not?
I'm going to teach you some day
I'm teaching you to read, not kung fu
Miss, you're going to kill me
Get up
Miss, your grandpa wants you to study ... not practise kung fu
Yes, you can only become strong by practising kung fu
This is how I scared away those 1 8 fools;
One by one
You should know that books contain more good things
What more?
Studying can improve your intelligence,
Understanding
Helps you learn to be polite and be filial
Teaches you about friendship, patriotism.
It's all... about being faithful, filial, kind, courteous modest
But one can't fight with these
So you think you fight very well... and you're unbeatable?
Okay, come here
Alright
Come
With you I'm competing on strength, not kung fu
Strength?
Can you throw this bamboo leaf... over to the other side of the bridge?
That's easy
Can't even throw a bamboo leaf across!
Where's your strength?
Not convinced yet?
Show me
How can you throw like this?
I put the leaf on a bamboo stick... and can throw it across without effort
Still don't want to yield?
I understand your trick
The wind can blow the bamboo leaf back;
But with the weight of the bamboo stick ... it could be shot like an arrow
Right, you should study more and develop intelligence
Let's go back and study... otherwise grandpa will scold you
Don't worry, he loves me most
It was he who taught me kung fu
Your grandpa knows kung fu?
What Kung fu?
He practises the 'Shadowy Fists'
Shadowy Fists?
Was that what you were practising just now?
No, it's like this
No matter whoever... is nabbed by grandpa's hands or legs... will never get free
This is called the Shadowy Fists
So powerful
I only managed to learn a bit of grandpa's skills
So everyone in your family knows this technique
No, apart from grandpa there is only one called...
Tang Nan Shan who knows such technique
What are you thinking?
Do you want to try again?
I was thinking of teaching you how to write, let's go!
Teach me writing?
Continue
Write like me, but smaller
Show me
Don't wriggle while you write, try to concentrate
Come on...
No
You should hold your pen like this
... and sit straight
Look
Your hand must be relaxed
Relax, relax
Look and write
Miss, come in and study.
Stop practising kung fu
I'd rather learn how to write than reading aloud
You come in first
If you don't return in 3 months
Your father will be degraded to a civilian past 6 months your family will be jailed past 1 year, your family will be slaughtered
Mister Wai
Are you all right?
I'm fine
I reckon the moonlit ambiance is best suited ... for a walk
Are you injured?
Good evening
Good evening, uncle Chung
Grandpa
Gi Gi
I have something to tell you
What is it?
I am going to kill your teacher because he is a spy
Kill him?
Grandpa
He is an emissary from the Qing court
I don't understand
Gi Gi
It has come to this ... so I will tell you the truth
Wu Yang Mansion... is a group for revolting against the regime
He who comes at the full moon each month ... is the messenger of Emperor Ping Xi
He brings funding... for organizing the uprising;
and the name list of each branch
Wai Fung may be... working undercover for the Qing court
Tien Chung has discovered his tracks
Hence he has got to die
He can't be a spy
Gi Gi
You are still young
Let grandpa handle this
No, I won't allow you to kill him
Mom, please help me plea with grandpa
This matter...
Grandpa
Gi Gi
This matter involves the success of our cause ... and we must do what is necessary
Grandpa, don't kill him
Gi Gi, if we don't kill him... one day he'll kill you and us, too
He doesn't even know kung fu, how can he?
The Manchu Emperor doesn't know kung fu either ...but he can cause just as many massacres
Isn't that right?
Regardless of what you say ... you can't kill him
Why?
Because I...
I'm in love with him
I expected this
Your personal love has blinded you from righteousness
Grandpa
Although you've fallen in love with him, but with time ... you'll forget him
No, I won't forget him, because...
Because what?
I...
I...
Speak up!
I'll say it.
If you kill him... you'd have killed my husband
Husband?
Gi Gi, have you both...
That's why you can't kill him
Gi Gi, how could you do that?
You... you've really done such a thing!
Grandpa, inside the study
I being alone with him, I...
Stop it
You...
Gi Gi, if he really is an emissary from the Qing Court
I can't let him stay
Right
We must kill him
Grandpa, if you must kill him ... then please kill me too
Gi Gi
Don't cry, I'll spare his life
But he must become our son-in-law ... and cannot leave this house
Can you guarantee this?
Yes, he'll agree
Grandpa, I'm going to tell him
Prepare for the wedding
Yes
Bridegroom to offer tea to Grandpa
Bride to offer tea to Grandpa
Grandpa
Here, please help Gi Gi to put this on
Gi Gi, this gold necklace is for you
I do hope Wai Fung will stay in this Mansion forever
Kneel down... and receive the royal decree
Wai Jing Yuan will be demoted to a civilian... from royal scholar
Thank you, your highness
What has happened with Wai Fung?
Lord, what's that for?
This is the Emperor's order
According to the letter
The southern and northern clans ... are deploying soldiers on a new plan
Yes
The new name list is here
Please keep it securely
Bao Jiang
Here
Place the document securely
Please sit
Please
Please report to Commander Ng
We await his orders
Where are you going to in the middle of the night?
Just taking a stroll
Can't sleep, is it?
I have been thinking about my parents
I've been here for over 4 months ... and feel nostalgic
But this is your home
Right, but my parents are back home ... and I wish to see them
Gi Gi, will you go with me?
Go with you?
Grandpa won't allow that
No, he will
Grandpa is a reasonable and righteous man
I see no reason that he'd stop you
Gi Gi, promise me you'll speak to him?
By royal decree Wai Jing Yuan is to be arrested
All servants will be taken to jail as criminals
Thank you, your highness
Master
Drag him out
Yes
Gi Gi
It's been almost two months, how's that?
About what?
About going home with me
Oh, I forgot
How can you forget such an important matter?
I'll ask next time
No need, I'll ask myself
Wai Fung
You...
Grandpa I have something to talk to you about
I wish...
Go on, speak up!
Grandpa, I have left home for half a year
My parents do not know about my marriage with Gi Gi, so...
Where are your parents?
In the capital
So you want to return home, right?
Yes, I wish if Gi Gi could accompany me home... and pay our respects to my parents and our ancestors
And at the same time...
You really have to go?
Yes, grandpa
Don't feel sad, we'll return soon
Okay, you should go
Wai Fung, when are you leaving?
The sooner the better.
If it could be...tomorrow?
All right then
I'll see you off
Thank you, I'll tell Gi Gi
Gi Gi, look at you you can't even handle such a small matter
You've spoken to him
Yes, and he agreed
He even said after obeisance to ancestors tomorrow ... he'll see us off
Grandpa said that?
Gi Gi, what's with you?
Don't cry
I'll bring you to my parents... and then we'll return soon
You don't understand
Grandpa will never let you...
leave here alive
How can that be?
He was very cordial about it
When he said that, he would have meant... you have to pass through five hurdles
And seeing you off means killing you
Gi Gi, what should I do now?
You're dead either way
As husband and wife we should die together
Gi Gi, I...
Let's surprise them and escape in the middle of the night
Escape?
You're saying...
Quickly, change your clothes
Change?
Get into casual wear, it's better for the road
Master, Gi Gi loves Wai Fung very much and will leave with him, at that time...
I hope Gi Gi will understand ... the rules set by our family
Should Gi Gi really leave with him... what should we do?
Then our rules will apply
What are these ropes for?
That is for climbing the wall
This is a shield for protecting the chest
Who is likely to be on watch for the first gate?
Uncle Chung
Tien Chung?
Uncle Chung
Madam, master
I am just doing my job
Can you give us a break?
Quickly, go
Wai Fung, go
Gi Gi, go quickly
Uncle Chung
Take care, you both
Wai Fung, you...
Wai Fung
Why didn't you tell me your kung fu is so good?
I'll tell you later
This time it should be fourth uncle
Right
Fourth uncle seems to be in great haste
Just like a horse
He has a quick temper
... so we must be careful
His sword skills are very good
But we can use his weakness ... which is his bad temper
And once we have the chance, we'll escape
Gi Gi, must you really go with him?
I must follow my husband
Perhaps you wouldn't understand
Such impertinence!
Gi Gi, for someone not married ... how would he understand?
How come you know kung fu?
I just taught him to handle you
With your quick temper, who would want to marry you?
That's okay, he can be a eunuch
Not with his temper
But once a eunuch, all that would evaporate
Gi Gi, run quickly
Run quickly
Sister-in-law
Bao Tung 1 st sister-in-law and I mind this hall
I don't care
Bao Tung, this concerns Tien's family rules
Please return
Thank you, auntie
Thank you, mom
Wai Fung, let's go
You...
You haven't passed me yet
Please let us go
Mom
Step aside
Mom
Gi Gi
Wax spearhead!
Thank you for your kindness
This was your aunt's idea
Thank you, auntie
Arise
Yes
Gi Gi, your mother and I... know the agony of losing a husband
Next round is your third uncle.
His sword skill... will surely conquer you both
The only way
With your help they can make it
I...
Gi Gi is your daughter
If you won't help her, who will?
Go
Let's go
You needn't plea for them
Bao Jiang, let them go
Gi Gi can go but Wai Fung must stay
Why do you want to separate them?
That...depends on ... how they pass my hurdle
Please excuse my insolence then
Uncle
You've passed through me ... but there's old master
Mother will help us
Gi Gi, I...
Mother
Mother, plea for us
Right, drop your weapons
Bao Jiang, forgive us
Go
Grandpa
Didn't you say you'll leave tomorrow?
Grandpa, we'll return
When you return... our place will be filled with... the Qing army
No
Gi Gi, you're the daughter of the Tien family ... and shouldn't leave
Grandpa, I am the daughter of the Tien family so Wai Fung is Tien family's son-in-law
How can we hurt the Tien family.
Besides... you love me the most
All the more you shouldn't leave
Grandpa
I am only going to see my in-laws
Have you forgotten... when you asked me to spare Wai Fung's life ... what I said?
But Wai Fung is my husband
Must you go?
Grandpa, please forgive me
You don't deserve to wear my jade broach
Grandpa
Master
My husband had long gone...
leaving me widowed and Gi Gi
Besides, she... is your only grand-daughter
She will not conspire with Wai Fung ... to harm us
Please let them go free
Gi Gi is not my grand-daughter... and The Tiene family has no son-in-law
Pick up your weapons
Grandpa
Master
Quickly
Grandpa
Grandpa
Grandpa
Daughter-in-law
Master, please let them go
The Shadowy Fist
Gi Gi
Gi Gi
Wai Fung, run quickly
Run quickly
Run quickly
Gi Gi
Come on, people
Grab him
After him, hurry
Prepare the horses
He must be in hiding
Shoot the arrows on sight
Prepare the arrows
Arrows away
Chase
Strange
Where is his dead body?
He must be dead from so many arrows
Go back!
Return
The Shadowy Fists
Please
Please
Uncle Chung
Who is it?
Wai Fung
I am aware of Tien family rules
One must enter and exit passing the hurdles
Please inform the old master
Inform old master quickly
Lock up all doors and windows
Hello, third uncle
You're still alive!
Grab your weapon
Fourth Uncle, haven't seen you for a long time
You still have a bad temper
Gi Gi is right
You're like a wild horse
More like a donkey than a wild horse, I'd say
Uncle, go ahead... and use your best sword skills
I didn't think you could return
I said I'd return
This time... how much Qing force have you brought along?
None
I've returned... to avenge Gi Gi and her mother
Avenge for what?
The Tien family matter is none of your concern
But Gi Gi belongs to the Wai family
I refuse to acknowledge you as son-in-law
Since you have already... passed four challenges;
What else are you waiting for?
You ought to return Gi Gi's jade broach
It's here with me
Come and get it
Good, I look forward to trying your Shadowy Fists
Not bad, what style is this?
No particular style... the mantis
Secret Order?
How come...
I sneaked into the Tien family for this
Scholar Wai, you teach well
Let's raise a toast to you
Thank you, your highness
Your highness
The merit should be to the Royal Guard you should award the Royal Guard first
Your highness should award the Scholar first
No, should be...
No...
Should award the Scholar first...
The regime is indebted to the Wai family ... so let's not stand on ceremony
Yes
Scholar Wai, your son glorifies your family name
Praiseworthy indeed
Thank you, your majesty
Thanks to the Great Ming regime
Father
Wai Fung
We have supported the Qing regime to... wait for an opportunity to overthrow the government
Father
You have slaughtered the Ming heroes
As my son you insult my family
I'd rather die
Arrest him
Stop
I've poisoned the wine.
Now it's time... for us father and son to perish for the Ming dynasty
Father!
Scholar Wai, why do such a thing
Well, let me tell you
Ming heroes who oppose the Qing regime ... can never be exterminated
The royal scholar Wai Jing Yuan and son Wai Fung ... greet your highness.
Long live the king
Rise
Thank you, your highness
Scholar, has your son ever been an official?
Your highness, my humble son ... is still studying
He does know some kung fu though

Wai Fung
Here, your highness
Ng San Kwai has devious intentions;
Have you heard about it?
I've been cloistered in my studies so I haven't heard
Wai Lit is contacting fighters loyal to last regime ... and might cause a rebellion
They are rebels and desperate men

Your highness, which group is this?

I am a mere humble servant and may not deliver
You are a scholar and soldier, and a Han
So you're the ideal person
If you accomplish the task, you'll be rewarded
Your highness, I...
Receive my decree
Yes, your highness
I command you to set forth to Qiping Province and investigate if the Tien people will rebel
After that, return to me with a full report
Yes, your highness
You have a great responsibility
If you don't return in 3 months... your father will be degraded to a civilian;
Past 6 months, your family will be jailed past 1 year, your family will be slaughtered
You...
Old sir
Having taught so many years...
I've never seen such a mischievous girl
It's unreasonable
Let's leave!
I haven't taught anything wrong she threw away the rice bowl herself
Old sir, don't teach anymore
No way

Otherwise how can I continue to teach
I think you needn't teach anymore
Go home and wait for your time to die!
How disrespectful!
You unreasonable girl you dare to discard your studies and hit your teacher
That's not hitting.
You're old... and clumsy
Just a light bump and you fell
This is beating me up
I'll hit you if you don't go
Go, you deserve a beating
What's the reasoning behind this?
Are you a teacher?
Of course, but now even a teacher has to be beaten up
Confucius will turn in his grave...
You dare mention Confucius?
Firstly talk about yourself
You teach her so that she'll be good
Yes
But you haven't taught her well ... so how can she be good?

She's so fierce

So, don't you think he should be beaten?
That's nonsense
Old sir, forget it
How ridiculous!
Forget it
Just my luck
Hey, take back your umbrella
And this, too
Old sir, go back!
Hey
What's your name?
My first name is Fung, last name Wai
What a strange, long name

I'll let you be my teacher, how's that?
No way
Why not?
If you want me to be your teacher ... you address me as Mr Wai
I won't
Then I'll not teach you
Little Fatty
You...
Will you teach?
No
Right, here are my rules
If you refuse, I'll give you 3 punches
And after that...
like me, leave the Tien mansion
Mr. Wai, you'd better stay behind to teach
No
Mr. Wai, be my teacher please
Okay, you should from now on be polite to your teacher
Respect your teacher, be attentive work hard, and...
Not to punch him, correct?
Uncle Chung, I've got a new teacher again
This is...
Mr. Wai
Uncle Chung, where's my mom?
Gi Gi, you are giving Uncle Chung trouble again
Why don't you stay in the room and study
Mom
Auntie
Mom, I've got a new teacher again
New teacher?
Where's Mr. Wong?
Useless old codger
He's been scared away by me
Gi Gi, you aren't listening
Your grandpa will be angry if he knew
Grandpa?
If I tell him, he won't be angry
Hey...
Teacher Wai
This is my mom; my auntie
I'm Wai Fung, at your service
Old Master is here
The Jun Shing Temple has already been renovated and harvest in the Southern Village is good
Grandpa
Good morning
Good morning, uncles
Grandpa
Grandpa, have some tea
Mr. Wai, ours is an affluent family
We won't treat you badly
Thank you, Master
But our family discipline is very strict too
Except for the study room, the backyard ... and beyond are off limits
You shouldn't go in, especially to the side garden
I understand
Yuen Chong
Bring him in
Yes
Grandpa, I'll go with him
Gi Gi, Gi Gi
Please
Master, you've spoilt her
Dad, isn't this teacher a bit too young
Yes, Gi Gi is young and inexperienced, I'm afraid...
I know
The previous ones were a bit old
I hope that this young one can teach her better
This place is where third uncle reads
How can there be weapons in a place of study?
Uncle practises kung fu during his leisure time
Please
Phoenix dance?
Mom and auntie live there
Mr. Wai, this way please
This Bun Ma Hall is possibly where Fourth Uncle lives
Mr. Wai, please
Mr. Wai, the other side leads to the side garden
It's where old master Tien retreats, that is...
That is the study
Mr. Wai, please
Uncle Chung, you go first
I'll stay with teacher
Miss, we're leaving
Mr. Wai
You'll have to watch your steps... otherwise you may fall into the water
Alright, alright
Please
Also
I almost forgot to tell you
That is where I used to play
This is where I practise kung fu
Miss, you're beating me up already
This is where you sleep
The lessons would be conducted here
Let's see how you're going to teach me
Open the book and read after me
Meng Zhi went to see Emperor Leung Wai
Meng Zhi went to see Emperor Leung Wai
Wang said
Wang said
You've come from far away
Why don't you repeat after me?
You should look at the book, not me
You are weird
Weird?
How so?
You're different from them
Who?
The 1 8 teachers whom I've scared away
So...
I'm the 1 9th
Recite after me
Emperor said you've come from far away
Emperor said you've come from far away
Will my country be at a disadvantage?
Will my country be at a disadvantage?
Meng Zhi said why speak of advantages?
Teacher
Don't practise kung fu now
Why not?
I'm going to teach you some day
I'm teaching you to read, not kung fu
Miss, you're going to kill me
Get up
Miss, your grandpa wants you to study ... not practise kung fu
Yes, you can only become strong by practising kung fu
This is how I scared away those 1 8 fools;
One by one
You should know that books contain more good things
What more?
Studying can improve your intelligence,
Understanding
Helps you learn to be polite and be filial
Teaches you about friendship, patriotism.
It's all... about being faithful, filial, kind, courteous modest
But one can't fight with these
So you think you fight very well... and you're unbeatable?
Okay, come here
Alright
Come
With you I'm competing on strength, not kung fu
Strength?
Can you throw this bamboo leaf... over to the other side of the bridge?
That's easy
Can't even throw a bamboo leaf across!
Where's your strength?
Not convinced yet?
Show me
How can you throw like this?
I put the leaf on a bamboo stick... and can throw it across without effort
Still don't want to yield?
I understand your trick
The wind can blow the bamboo leaf back;
But with the weight of the bamboo stick ... it could be shot like an arrow
Right, you should study more and develop intelligence
Let's go back and study... otherwise grandpa will scold you
Don't worry, he loves me most
It was he who taught me kung fu
Your grandpa knows kung fu?
What Kung fu?
He practises the 'Shadowy Fists'
Shadowy Fists?
Was that what you were practising just now?
No, it's like this
No matter whoever... is nabbed by grandpa's hands or legs... will never get free
This is called the Shadowy Fists
So powerful
I only managed to learn a bit of grandpa's skills
So everyone in your family knows this technique
No, apart from grandpa there is only one called...
Tang Nan Shan who knows such technique
What are you thinking?
Do you want to try again?
I was thinking of teaching you how to write, let's go!
Teach me writing?
Continue
Write like me, but smaller
Show me
Don't wriggle while you write, try to concentrate
Come on...
No
You should hold your pen like this
... and sit straight
Look
Your hand must be relaxed
Relax, relax
Look and write
Miss, come in and study.
Stop practising kung fu
I'd rather learn how to write than reading aloud
You come in first
If you don't return in 3 months
Your father will be degraded to a civilian past 6 months your family will be jailed past 1 year, your family will be slaughtered
Mister Wai
Are you all right?
I'm fine
I reckon the moonlit ambiance is best suited ... for a walk
Are you injured?
Good evening
Good evening, uncle Chung
Grandpa
Gi Gi
I have something to tell you
What is it?
I am going to kill your teacher because he is a spy
Kill him?
Grandpa
He is an emissary from the Qing court
I don't understand
Gi Gi
It has come to this ... so I will tell you the truth
Wu Yang Mansion... is a group for revolting against the regime
He who comes at the full moon each month ... is the messenger of Emperor Ping Xi
He brings funding... for organizing the uprising;
and the name list of each branch
Wai Fung may be... working undercover for the Qing court
Tien Chung has discovered his tracks
Hence he has got to die
He can't be a spy
Gi Gi
You are still young
Let grandpa handle this
No, I won't allow you to kill him
Mom, please help me plea with grandpa
This matter...
Grandpa
Gi Gi
This matter involves the success of our cause ... and we must do what is necessary
Grandpa, don't kill him
Gi Gi, if we don't kill him... one day he'll kill you and us, too
He doesn't even know kung fu, how can he?
The Manchu Emperor doesn't know kung fu either ...but he can cause just as many massacres
Isn't that right?
Regardless of what you say ... you can't kill him
Why?
Because I...
I'm in love with him
I expected this
Your personal love has blinded you from righteousness
Grandpa
Although you've fallen in love with him, but with time ... you'll forget him
No, I won't forget him, because...
Because what?
I...
I...
Speak up!
I'll say it.
If you kill him... you'd have killed my husband
Husband?
Gi Gi, have you both...
That's why you can't kill him
Gi Gi, how could you do that?
You... you've really done such a thing!
Grandpa, inside the study
I being alone with him, I...
Stop it
You...
Gi Gi, if he really is an emissary from the Qing Court
I can't let him stay
Right
We must kill him
Grandpa, if you must kill him ... then please kill me too
Gi Gi
Don't cry, I'll spare his life
But he must become our son-in-law ... and cannot leave this house
Can you guarantee this?
Yes, he'll agree
Grandpa, I'm going to tell him
Prepare for the wedding
Yes
Bridegroom to offer tea to Grandpa
Bride to offer tea to Grandpa
Grandpa
Here, please help Gi Gi to put this on
Gi Gi, this gold necklace is for you
I do hope Wai Fung will stay in this Mansion forever
Kneel down... and receive the royal decree
Wai Jing Yuan will be demoted to a civilian... from royal scholar
Thank you, your highness
What has happened with Wai Fung?
Lord, what's that for?
This is the Emperor's order
According to the letter
The southern and northern clans ... are deploying soldiers on a new plan
Yes
The new name list is here
Please keep it securely
Bao Jiang
Here
Place the document securely
Please sit
Please
Please report to Commander Ng
We await his orders
Where are you going to in the middle of the night?
Just taking a stroll
Can't sleep, is it?
I have been thinking about my parents
I've been here for over 4 months ... and feel nostalgic
But this is your home
Right, but my parents are back home ... and I wish to see them
Gi Gi, will you go with me?
Go with you?
Grandpa won't allow that
No, he will
Grandpa is a reasonable and righteous man
I see no reason that he'd stop you
Gi Gi, promise me you'll speak to him?
By royal decree Wai Jing Yuan is to be arrested
All servants will be taken to jail as criminals
Thank you, your highness
Master
Drag him out
Yes
Gi Gi
It's been almost two months, how's that?
About what?
About going home with me
Oh, I forgot
How can you forget such an important matter?
I'll ask next time
No need, I'll ask myself
Wai Fung
You...
Grandpa I have something to talk to you about
I wish...
Go on, speak up!
Grandpa, I have left home for half a year
My parents do not know about my marriage with Gi Gi, so...
Where are your parents?
In the capital
So you want to return home, right?
Yes, I wish if Gi Gi could accompany me home... and pay our respects to my parents and our ancestors
And at the same time...
You really have to go?
Yes, grandpa
Don't feel sad, we'll return soon
Okay, you should go
Wai Fung, when are you leaving?
The sooner the better.
If it could be...tomorrow?
All right then
I'll see you off
Thank you, I'll tell Gi Gi
Gi Gi, look at you you can't even handle such a small matter
You've spoken to him
Yes, and he agreed
He even said after obeisance to ancestors tomorrow ... he'll see us off
Grandpa said that?
Gi Gi, what's with you?
Don't cry
I'll bring you to my parents... and then we'll return soon
You don't understand
Grandpa will never let you...
leave here alive
How can that be?
He was very cordial about it
When he said that, he would have meant... you have to pass through five hurdles
And seeing you off means killing you
Gi Gi, what should I do now?
You're dead either way
As husband and wife we should die together
Gi Gi, I...
Let's surprise them and escape in the middle of the night
Escape?
You're saying...
Quickly, change your clothes
Change?
Get into casual wear, it's better for the road
Master, Gi Gi loves Wai Fung very much and will leave with him, at that time...
I hope Gi Gi will understand ... the rules set by our family
Should Gi Gi really leave with him... what should we do?
Then our rules will apply
What are these ropes for?
That is for climbing the wall
This is a shield for protecting the chest
Who is likely to be on watch for the first gate?
Uncle Chung
Tien Chung?
Uncle Chung
Madam, master
I am just doing my job
Can you give us a break?
Quickly, go
Wai Fung, go
Gi Gi, go quickly
Uncle Chung
Take care, you both
Wai Fung, you...
Wai Fung
Why didn't you tell me your kung fu is so good?
I'll tell you later
This time it should be fourth uncle
Right
Fourth uncle seems to be in great haste
Just like a horse
He has a quick temper
... so we must be careful
His sword skills are very good
But we can use his weakness ... which is his bad temper
And once we have the chance, we'll escape
Gi Gi, must you really go with him?
I must follow my husband
Perhaps you wouldn't understand
Such impertinence!
Gi Gi, for someone not married ... how would he understand?
How come you know kung fu?
I just taught him to handle you
With your quick temper, who would want to marry you?
That's okay, he can be a eunuch
Not with his temper
But once a eunuch, all that would evaporate
Gi Gi, run quickly
Run quickly
Sister-in-law
Bao Tung 1 st sister-in-law and I mind this hall
I don't care
Bao Tung, this concerns Tien's family rules
Please return
Thank you, auntie
Thank you, mom
Wai Fung, let's go
You...
You haven't passed me yet
Please let us go
Mom
Step aside
Mom
Gi Gi
Wax spearhead!
Thank you for your kindness
This was your aunt's idea
Thank you, auntie
Arise
Yes
Gi Gi, your mother and I... know the agony of losing a husband
Next round is your third uncle.
His sword skill... will surely conquer you both
The only way
With your help they can make it
I...
Gi Gi is your daughter
If you won't help her, who will?
Go
Let's go
You needn't plea for them
Bao Jiang, let them go
Gi Gi can go but Wai Fung must stay
Why do you want to separate them?
That...depends on ... how they pass my hurdle
Please excuse my insolence then
Uncle
You've passed through me ... but there's old master
Mother will help us
Gi Gi, I...
Mother
Mother, plea for us
Right, drop your weapons
Bao Jiang, forgive us
Go
Grandpa
Didn't you say you'll leave tomorrow?
Grandpa, we'll return
When you return... our place will be filled with... the Qing army
No
Gi Gi, you're the daughter of the Tien family ... and shouldn't leave
Grandpa, I am the daughter of the Tien family so Wai Fung is Tien family's son-in-law
How can we hurt the Tien family.
Besides... you love me the most
All the more you shouldn't leave
Grandpa
I am only going to see my in-laws
Have you forgotten... when you asked me to spare Wai Fung's life ... what I said?
But Wai Fung is my husband
Must you go?
Grandpa, please forgive me
You don't deserve to wear my jade broach
Grandpa
Master
My husband had long gone...
leaving me widowed and Gi Gi
Besides, she... is your only grand-daughter
She will not conspire with Wai Fung ... to harm us
Please let them go free
Gi Gi is not my grand-daughter... and The Tiene family has no son-in-law
Pick up your weapons
Grandpa
Master
Quickly
Grandpa
Grandpa
Grandpa
Daughter-in-law
Master, please let them go
The Shadowy Fist
Gi Gi
Gi Gi
Wai Fung, run quickly
Run quickly
Run quickly
Gi Gi
Come on, people
Grab him
After him, hurry
Prepare the horses
He must be in hiding
Shoot the arrows on sight
Prepare the arrows
Arrows away
Chase
Strange
Where is his dead body?
He must be dead from so many arrows
Go back!
Return
The Shadowy Fists
Please
Please
Uncle Chung
Who is it?
Wai Fung
I am aware of Tien family rules
One must enter and exit passing the hurdles
Please inform the old master
Inform old master quickly
Lock up all doors and windows
Hello, third uncle
You're still alive!
Grab your weapon
Fourth Uncle, haven't seen you for a long time
You still have a bad temper
Gi Gi is right
You're like a wild horse
More like a donkey than a wild horse, I'd say
Uncle, go ahead... and use your best sword skills
I didn't think you could return
I said I'd return
This time... how much Qing force have you brought along?
None
I've returned... to avenge Gi Gi and her mother
Avenge for what?
The Tien family matter is none of your concern
But Gi Gi belongs to the Wai family
I refuse to acknowledge you as son-in-law
Since you have already... passed four challenges;
What else are you waiting for?
You ought to return Gi Gi's jade broach
It's here with me
Come and get it
Good, I look forward to trying your Shadowy Fists
Not bad, what style is this?
No particular style... the mantis
Secret Order?
How come...
I sneaked into the Tien family for this
Scholar Wai, you teach well
Let's raise a toast to you
Thank you, your highness
Your highness
The merit should be to the Royal Guard you should award the Royal Guard first
Your highness should award the Scholar first
No, should be...
No...
Should award the Scholar first...
The regime is indebted to the Wai family ... so let's not stand on ceremony
Yes
Scholar Wai, your son glorifies your family name
Praiseworthy indeed
Thank you, your majesty
Thanks to the Great Ming regime
Father
Wai Fung
We have supported the Qing regime to... wait for an opportunity to overthrow the government
Father
You have slaughtered the Ming heroes
As my son you insult my family
I'd rather die
Arrest him
Stop
I've poisoned the wine.
Now it's time... for us father and son to perish for the Ming dynasty
Father!
Scholar Wai, why do such a thing
Well, let me tell you
Ming heroes who oppose the Qing regime ... can never be exterminated
Enter!
Enter
Did you say enter?
Did you ever think of getting a hearing aid Sidney?
I beg your pardon.
Oh never mind
I brought the stock room key back.
Oh, thank you.
Don't forget it is the school concert this week.
Pardon.
The school concert.
Oh, I'll get all ready.
Good.
I wonder what Mr. Brown's class is going to do.
Did he mention anything to you?
Oh no, he didn't.
No, no.
As a matter of fact
I don't think anyone will do anything.
That's non sense.
Every class is expected to put on some sort of show.
But you tell Mr. Brown to come and see me at tea break.
Pardon?
Tea break
Oh, is it?
I can do it.
See you.
I would like your presence everyone.
As you can recall when last we met, I gave you each for your homework a different task to do over the weekend.
Hope you have all done them.
Yes.
Good.
I want you each in turn to stand up and give me a report on your various activities, alright?
Now who'd like to begin?
Me
We'll start at the back, shell we?
With you Jamila.
Your homework was a visit to the cinema.
Would you like to tell us about the film you saw?
It was about the most beautiful top class Indian girl who is fell in love with boy from bottom class.
Lower class.
But girl's father said no get married.
So they ran away.
But father catched them and chopped off boy's legs.
Later, father died.
One day, girl see a beggar man in the street.
Oh, it is her sweet heart!
She cried.
No legs, no matter!
You be marry me.
Okay, he say.
I will go and be make myself look nice.
With no legs?
So he go.
Girl, she cries and run after him, and then a big motor car hit her and kill her.
It was most miserable film and I enjoyed it very much.
Good, well done Jamila, very good.
Taro?
Your homework was a visit to London Zoo.
Tell us about it.
I arrive at London Zoo.
No, no Taro, no.
London Zoo.
Start again.
London Zoo.
There are no os.
Oh, yes please.
There are two Os in London and two Os in Zoo.
That's absolutely correct Ali, but I'm refering to the ends of the words alright?
Now carry on Taro, but do try and get out of the habit of ending everyother word in O
I try.
Went first to see buffal.
Bufful?
Like a big bull.
Oh, a buffalo.
Taro confusedo.
Words that end in O like buffalo or radio or vertigo, you pronounce the o.
But where there's no o, you don't have one, do you understand?
Yeso!
I give up.
Alright Taro, thank you.
Now Ali!
Yes please.
I asked you to read one of Shakespeare's plays.
Were you able to do that?
Most definitely.
I'm reading about Sherlock.
You mean Shaylock.
Yes please.
The Merchant of Venice.
Oh, good.
Carry on.
First of all, there is a lady Porta.
Her name was Portia.
Yes please.
Now a man called Bassanio is fancying this lady Porta, Portia.
But he's broken.
Broken what?
Stony broken, no money.
You mean broke.
Carry on.
So he's going to see his friend Antonio.
And saying,
"oh please be lending me 3.000 buckets. "
Duckets.
Sorry please.
But Antonio was also broken so he's going to shaylock the money lending man and asking him to lend him the money.
Shaylock is agreed.
But on one condition!
If in three months time he is not paying him back the money, then Shaylock could cut off one pound of Antonio's fleshy.
Why is he wanting a pound of human flesh?
Might be one of them is cannon balls.
Cannibals.
Oh no, he is doing the because he is not liking Antonio.
Anyway, Antonio is in a bigger trouble.
He wrecked all his chips.
Ships.
Ships.
And he is not being able to pay back the money.
Now Shaylock is wanting his pound of flesh.
But Lady Portia is pretending to be lawyer man.
And she saying, "Agreement was for one pound of flesh and no drop of blood. "
Sheylock has had it.
How can he had it when he is not getting it?
You damn fool, you are not understanding the queen's English.
I know the queen is English.
You think I'm stupid?
Most definitely.
You two sit down.
Thank you Ali, very well done.
Right.
Now Su lee, your task was a visit to Petticoat lane.
Petticoat lane very disappointing.
Why was that?
Not see one Petticoat.
Look, don't you find market places interesting?
Market places full of capitalistic traders selling merchandizes to ignorant walking people in very high prices.
General Mao Says...
Don't mind what general Mao says, thank you Su lee.
Well done.
Ranjeet, your task was a visit to High Gate Cemetry.
And I am finding it very interesting.
Good, then tell us all about it.
Firstly, I'm seeing the burying place of Carl Marx.
Ah, yes, the father of Communism.
But I'm not understanding which one he was.
I'm sorry I didn't understand.
Was he Chico, Harpo, or Groucho?
Carl Marx was not one of the Marx's brothers.
Thousands apologies.
What else did you see?
I'm seeing many beautiful grey stones.
Graves stones.
That is correct.
And some of them have written on them beautiful words.
I'm writing one down.
You are gone my dearest wife.
Still I feel no pain for I know at heaven's gate we will meet again.
What's the matter Giovanni?
I can't help it professor.
It is so sad.
That poor husband, he was in love with his wife very much
Don't be sad!
Husband is be very happy.
How do you know?
He dying the year after.
Oh, thanks goodness.
I'm so happy for him.
And they are both being football fans.
How on earth do you know that?
He is having put on his stone:
United forever.
That's meant Ranjeet he's being reunited with his wife in heaven.
Thousands apologies.
Yes, well thank you, well done.
Good.
Right!
Giovanni have you recovered sufficiently to tell us about you visit to speakers' corner?
Okay dockey.
First, I taken the tube to Hyde Park.
Then for an hour, nothing.
What do you mean nothing?
Nobody was there.
What?
Ten o'clock on a Sunday morning?
That's right.
That's strange.
There's always people at speaker's corner every weekend.
I asked a police man why is there nobody here?
And I find out why there is nobody there.
Why was it that there was nobody there?
I was at the wrong corner.
Silence.
Carry on Giovanni.
Excuse me Mr. Brown.
Oh yes Mrs. Courtney.
What have you done about the concert?
Pardon?
Is everybody at the school going deaf?
I want to know what you have done about the concert?
Concert?
There has been a notice on the board for the past two weeks.
You haven't read it?
Mr. Brown has read it.
He was discussing it with us before you came in.
Yes.
Yes, I was!
Good.
Then what are you going to do?
Well, I expect them all to be there.
Gentlemen I hope you will be there, but what I want to know is what your students' contribution will be.
Contribution?
Perform?
Perdón, señora.
It's going to be a surprise.
But I don't like surprises.
I want to be quite sure what they're going to do would be acceptable.
So I suggest that after tea break you and your class can give me a preview of the intended
We helped you out pretty good, huh?
Yes, but not for very long.
Por favor!
We still have to think of something to do for this concert in less than half an hour.
Yes, you're right.
With your brain, and our talent, no problem!
To me!
To me!
No, over here!
Not you, me!
Right.
Okay.
I brought you a nice cup of tea Mr. Brown.
Oh, thank you Gladis.
There!
Thank you!
What are they all going to do for the Concert tonight?
The show thing that they are practicing outside now.
Oh, would you like me to do a bit.
A bit of what?
Singing.
I was in the choir.
Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, lift up your voice and sing!
Turn it up Gladis!
You're girgling in the milk.
Don't you be so jealous Sid!
Do you like my voice Mr. Brown?
I think it's remarkable.
Thank you.
I could do your turn if you like.
You, Sid?
Yeah, watch this!
Oh, that's cool!
Alright, come on!
Let's start.
Alright Mr. Brown!
Alright!
Alright, come along everybody.
Good, good.
Jamila, what are you doing?
Ah, good.
Yes, good!
Come along every body.
Miss Courtney will be here any minute.
I'm here now Mr. Brown!
Good, would you like to sit there Miss Courtney?
Thank you.
I do hope I'm going to enjoy this.
So do I.
I wouldn't like to be embarassed in front of our distinguished guests.
No, no.
What distinguished guests?
Quite a few members of the educational authority always come to see our concerts.
I don't want a repitition of what happened last year.
What happened?
Mr. Jarvis's wood work students were quite awful.
They sang rugby songs out of tune.
Mr. Jarvis still hasn't found another job.
How comforting.
Would you all come out here when I introduce you?
I have a kind of program.
I shall stop you if there's anything I don't like.
Right.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
Stop.
What's the matter?
This concert takes place in the afternoon.
Stop!
Now what was wrong with that?
Mr. Brown, by the time you and your class come out, the audience will have been sitting on those hard chairs for one and a half hours.
I wouldn't mention anything about comfort if I were you.
Ah, right.
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
The English as a foreign language class is proud to present a pot pourri of music and laughter.
And to start us off, we have from Hungary "Zoltan Szabo".
Good evening everybody.
Good afternoon!
Ah, good afternoon!
Hungarian magic!
Hungarian paper!
Second Hungarian magic.
Stop.
Don't you want to see Hungarian magic.
You don't think I even want first Hungarian magic.
Never mind Zoltan.
That's very good.
Sit down.
Yes, alright.
And now from Italy, the irrepressible, Giovanni Cupello.
Grazie.
For you, I'm gonna do some impersonations.
Okay, here we go!
Hey, you wanna a nice piece of salame?
I've got a lovely piece for you.
And who is that supposed to be?
That's my butcher Antonio.
We have never heard of your butcher.
Maybe not, but if you had, it's very much like him.
Can you do and impressions of and well-know people?
Sure, I can.
Jimmy Cagney.
In a scene from the film
"Disaster on the fifth Avenue"
You dirty rat.
Oh, you dirty, dirty rat!
I'm going to fix you.
I haven't finished yet.
Well, Mr. Cagney sounds remarkable like you butcher.
And now from France, the delightful, Danielle.
Thank you!
Do you know any of the words Danielle?
I do not sing the words, I just dance to the music.
And what is all this "off" business?
That is when I'm taking off my clothes.
We can't have that sort of thing going on.
It is not going on, it is coming off.
Not in my school!
Yeah, well, thank you Danielle!
Well-done Jolly good!
And now, from the mysterious east, we have to sing for you Taro Nagazumi.
I sing for you a traditional Japanese song calledo a "Warrior's Lamento. "
Stop.
Why you tell me 'stopo'?
Because it was awful.
I thought it had a certain style!
Yeah, sickening.
Sorry, you no liko my song.
And now from Germany, will you welcome with her animal impressions
Anna Schmidt.
Danke, I would like you to com to visit me on a walk in the black forest.

The dog is chasing the sheep, baa baa, and the cows, moo moo.
Here comes a man on his horse, neigh neigh.
No, no Anna.
No, neigh, neigh.
You are supposed to do the actuel sounds like...

It hurts my throat.
Thank you for trying.
Anyway, jolly good!
Well-done.
And now from China with something peculiarly Chinese, will you welcome miss Chin Su Lee?
Chairman Mao he say, in the conditions of remaining
China today, the contradictions among the peasantry and the...
Stop.
This is supposed to be a school concert not a party not a political broadcast.
Can't you sing or anything?
I can sing songs of revolution.
Right, and now it's time for a little comedy
From Ali Nadim and Ranjeet Singh.
There's a little yellow island at the north of Katmandu.
I am saying, I am saying, I am saying.
Yes, please.
Why is a rhinoceros being like an elephant?
Why is a rhinoceros is like being an elephant?
Cause neither of them can ride a bicycle.
I wasn't able to know that.
Please be leaving The stage.
There's a little yellow island to the north of Katmandu.
I am saying, I am saying, I am saying...
Stop!
You are not liking us?
No.
What did you expect?
More common ways?
If you're wanting, we can be doing more common ways.
I could be the fat short one with the hairy legs.
And I can be the one with the glasses.
We'll discuss it later.
Thank you.
Very good,
Our next student to entertain you with a little culture is Jamila Ranjha.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am tell you beautiful English poetries by Thomas Grey.
Ellijah written in country
Elegy
Sorry Master.
...And leaves the world to darkness and to me!
Incredible.
I'll work on her pronunciation.
Thank you Jamila.
And now
From Spain to entertain you comes Juan Cervantes.
Mr. Brown he tells you I am from Spain.
That's surprise, isn't?
When I speak, I have no accent at all.
In Spain one times, I was going to be the bull-fighter, so one Sunday afternoon, I go to the bull-fight and they put me in the bullring.
The bull comes out.
I look at the bull and the bull, he look at me.
He look at me, and I look at the bull.
The bull was better looking than me.
Why you no laugh?
It's alright.
So I not become the bull fighter because I don't kill pretty bulls.
Good, huh?
You never saw me dance the flamenco.
I do it very good.
Alright, and finally to complete our contribution,
Greece and Sweeden combine.
Maximillian Papandrious and Ingrid Svenson.
And now my beautiful assistant and I are going to do some giggling.
Juggling.
All we need is a little practice.
We can't afford the plates.
Well-done.
Sit down both of you.
Well Mr. Brown, I think we can cancel all this off.
Oh, please Miss Courtney, the students would be so disappointed.
I mean we still have three days.
Just give us a chance.
Alright, very well.
But remember this Mr. Brown!
Good jobs are hard to find!
Thank you, "the weight watchers. "
And now Ladies and gentlemen, hail Jeremy Brown and his United Nations.
Thank you!
Enter!
Enter
Did you say enter?
Did you ever think of getting a hearing aid Sidney?
I beg your pardon.
Oh never mind
I brought the stock room key back.
Oh, thank you.
Don't forget it is the school concert this week.
Pardon.
The school concert.
Oh, I'll get all ready.
Good.
I wonder what Mr. Brown's class is going to do.
Did he mention anything to you?
Oh no, he didn't.
No, no.
As a matter of fact
I don't think anyone will do anything.
That's non sense.
Every class is expected to put on some sort of show.
But you tell Mr. Brown to come and see me at tea break.
Pardon?
Tea break
Oh, is it?
I can do it.
See you.
I would like your presence everyone.
As you can recall when last we met, I gave you each for your homework a different task to do over the weekend.
Hope you have all done them.
Yes.
Good.
I want you each in turn to stand up and give me a report on your various activities, alright?
Now who'd like to begin?
Me
We'll start at the back, shell we?
With you Jamila.
Your homework was a visit to the cinema.
Would you like to tell us about the film you saw?
It was about the most beautiful top class Indian girl who is fell in love with boy from bottom class.
Lower class.
But girl's father said no get married.
But father catched them and chopped off boy's legs.
Later, father died.
One day, girl see a beggar man in the street.
Oh, it is her sweet heart!
She cried.
No legs, no matter!
You be marry me.
Okay, he say.
I will go and be make myself look nice.
With no legs?
So he go.
Girl, she cries and run after him, and then a big motor car hit her and kill her
It was most miserable film and I enjoyed it very much.
Good, well done Jamila, very good.
Taro?
Your homework was a visit to London Zoo.
Tell us about it.
I arrive at London Zoo.
No, no Taro, no.
London Zoo.
Start again.
London Zoo.
There are no os.
Oh, yes please.
There are two Os in London and two Os in Zoo.
That's absolutely correct Ali, but I'm refering to the ends of the words alright?
Now carry on taro, but do try and get out of the habit of ending everyother word in O
I try.
Went first to see buffal.
Bufful?
Like a big bull.
Oh, a buffalo.
Taro confusedo.
Words that end in O like buffalo or radio or vertigo, you pronounce the o.
But where there's no o, you don't have one, do you understand?
Yeso!
I give up.
Alright Taro, thank you.
Now Ali!
Yes please.
I asked you to read one of Shakespeare's plays.
Were you able to do that?
Most definitely.
I'm reading about Sherlock.
You mean Shaylock.
Yes please.
The Merchant of Venica.
Oh, good.
Carry on.
First of all, there is a lady Porta.
Her name was Portia.
Yes please.
Now a man called Bassanio is fancying This lady Porta, Portia.
But he's broken.
Broken what?
Stony broken, no money.
You mean broke.
Carry on.
So he's going to see his friend Antonio.
And saying,
"oh please be lending me 3.000 buckets."
Duckets.
Sorry please.
But Antonio was also broken so he's going to shaylock the money lending man and asking him to lend him the money.
Shaylock is agreed.
But on one condition!
If in three months time he is not paying him back the money, then Shaylock could cut off one pound of Antonio's fleshy.
Why is he wanting a pound of human flesh?
Might be one of them is cannon balls.
Cannibals.
Oh no, he is doing the because he is not liking Antonio.
Anyway, Antonio is in a bigger trouble.
He wrecked all his chips.
Ships.
Ships.
And he is not being able to Pay back the money.
Now shaylock is wanting his pound of flesh.
But Lady Portia is pretending to be Lawyer man.
And she saying, "Agreement was for one pound of flesh and no drop of blood."
Sheylock has had it.
How can he had it when he is not getting it?
You damn fool, you are not understanding the queen's English.
I know the queen is English.
You think I'm stupid?
Most definitely.
You two sit down.
Thank you Ali, very well done.
Right.
Now Su lee your task was a visit to Petticoat lane.
Petticoat lane very disappointing.
Why was that?
Not see one Petticoat.
Petticoat Lane is just the name of the place,
Look, don't You find market places interesting?
Market places full of capitalistic traders selling merchandizes
To ignorant working classes in very high prices.
Chairman Mao Says...
Don't mind what Chairman Mao says, thank you Su lee Well done.
Ranjeet, your task was a visit to High Gate Cemetry.
And I am finding it very interesting.
Good, then tell us all about it.
Firstly, I'm seeing the burying place of Carl Marx.
Ah, yes, the father of Communism.
But I'm not understanding which one he was.
I'm sorry I didn't understand.
Was he Chicco, Harpo, or Groucho?
Carl Marx was not one of the Marx brothers.
Thousands apologies.
What else did you see?
I'm seeing many beautiful gravy stones.
Graves stones.
That is correct.
And some of them have written on them beautiful words.
I'm writing one down.
You are gone my dearest wife.
Still I feel no pain for I know at heaven's gate we will meet again.
What's the matter Giovanni?
I can't help it professor.
He is so sad.
That poor, he was in love with his wife very much
Don't be sad!
Husband is be very happy.
How do you know?
He dying the year after.
Oh, thanks goodness.
I'm so happy for him.
And they are both being football fans.
How on earth do you know that?
He is having put on his stone:
United forever.
That's meant Ranjeet he's being reunited with his wife in heaven.
Thousands appologies.
Yes, well thank you, well done.
Good.
Right!
Giovanni have you recovered sufficiently to tell us about you visit to speakers' corner?
Now
Okay dockey.
First, I taken the tube to Hyde Park.
Then for an hour, nothing.
What do you mean nothing?
No body was there.
What?
Ten o'clock on a Sunday morning?
That's right.
That's strange.
There's always people at speaker's corner every weekend.
I asked a police man why is there nobody here?
And I find out why there is nobody there.
Why was it that there was nobody there?
I was at the wrong corner.
Silence.
Carry on Govanni.
Excuse me Mr. Brown.
Oh yes Mrs. Courtney.
What have you done about the concert?
Pardon?
Is everybody at the school going deaf?
I want to know what you have done about the concert?
Concert?
There has been a notice on the board for the past two weeks.
You haven't read it?
Mr. Brown has read it.
He was discussing it with us before you came in.
Yes.
Si!
Yes, I was!
Good.
Then what are you going to do?
Well, I expect them all to be there.
Gentlemen I hope you will be there, but what I want to know is what your students' contribution will be.
Contribution?
Yes, what little party piece are they going to perform.
Party...?
Well...
Perdón señora.
It's going to be a surprise.
Yes, it's going to be a surprise
Well I don't like surprises.
I want to be quite sure what they're going to do would be acceptable.
So I suggest that after tea break you and your class can give me a preview of the intended performance
We helped you out pretty good, huh?
Yes, but not for very long.
Por favor?
We still have to think of something to do for this concert in less than half an hour.
Yes, all right.
With your brain, and our talent, no problem!
To me!
To me!
To me!
No, over here!
Not you, me!
Right.
Okay.
I brought you a nice cup of tea Mr. Brown.
Oh, thank you Gladis.
There!
Thank you!
What are they all going to do for the Concert tonight?
The show thing that they are practicing outside now.
Oh, would you like me to do a bit.
A bit of what?
Singing.
I was in the choir.
Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, lift up your voice and sing!
Turn it up Gladis!
You're girgling in the milk.
Don't you be so jealous Sid!
Do you like my voice Mr. Brown?
I think it's remarkable.
Thank you.
I could do your turn if you like.
You "Sid"!
Yeah, watch this!
Oh, that's cool!
Alright, come on!
Lets start
Alright Mr. Brown!
Alright!
Alright, come along everybody.
Good, good.
Jamila What are you doing?
Ah, good.
Yes, good!
Come along every body.
Miss Courtney will be here any minute.
I'm here now Mr. Brown!
Good, would you like to sit there Miss Courtney?
Thank you.
I do hope I'm going to enjoy this.
So do I.
I wouldn't like to be embaressed infront of our distinguished guests.
No, no.
What distinguished guests?
Quite a few members of the educational authority always come to see our concerts.
I don't want a repitition of what happened last year.
What happened?
Mr. Jarvis's wood work students were quite awful.
They sang rugby songs out of tune.
Mr. Jarvis still hasn't found another job.
How comforting.
Would you all come out here when I introduce you?
I have a kind of program.
I shall stop you if there's anything I don't like.
Right.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
Stop.
What's the matter?
This concert takes place in the afternoon.
Stop!
Now what was wrong with that?
Mr. Brown, by the time you and your class come out, the audience will have been sitting on those hard chairs for one and a half hours.
I wouldn't mention anything about comfort if I were you.
Ah, right.
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
The English as
A foreign language class is proud to present a pot pourri of music and laughter.
And to start us off, we have from Hungary "Zoltan Szabo".
Good evening everybody.
Good afternoon!
Ah, good afternoon!

Hungarian paper!
Second Hungarian magic.
Stop.
What?
Don't you want to see Hungarian magic.
You don't think I even want first Hungarian magic.
Never mind Zoltan.
That's very good.
Sit down.
Yes, alright.
And now from Italy, the irrepressible, Giovanni Cupello.
Grazie.
For you, I'm gonna do some impersonations.
Okay, here we go!
Hey, you wanna a nice piece of salami?
I've got a lovely piece for you.
And who is that supposed to be?
That's my butcher Antonio.
We have never heard of your butcher.
Maybe not, but if you had, it's very much like him.
Can you do and impressions of any well-known people?
Sure, I can.
Jimmy Cagney.
In a scene from the film

I'm going to fix you.
I haven't finished yet.
Well, Mr. Cagney sounds remarkable like you butcher.

It is not going on, it is coming off.
Not in my school!
But I'm...

And now, from the mysterious east, we have to sing for you Taro Nagazumi.

The dog is chasing the sheep, baa baa, and the cows, moo moo.
Ah, here comes a man on his horse, neigh neigh.
No, no Anna.
No, neigh, neigh.

It hurts my throat.
Thank you for trying.
Anyway, jolly good!
Well-done.

Will you welcome Miss Chin Su Lee?
Chairman Mao he say:
In the conditions prevailing in China today, the contradictions among the people comprise the contradictions among the working class, the contradictions within the peasantry, the contradictions...

And I can be the one with the glasses.
We'll discuss it later.
Thank you.
Very good, very good.
Great.
Our next student to entertain you with a little culture is Jamila Ranjha.

Elegy
Sorry Master
The-cur few-tolls the-knell of-par ting-day...
Ting-day.
The-lo wing-herd winds-slow ly-o'er the-lea,
The-plough man home ward-plods his-wea ry-way, ...And leaves the world to darkness and to me!
Incredible.
I'll work on her pronunciation.
Thank you Jamila.
And now
From Spain to entertain you comes Juan Cervantes.
Mr. Brown he tells you I am from Spain.
That's surprise, isn't?
When I speak, I have no accent at all.
In Spain one times, I was going to be the bull-fighter, so one Sunday afternoon, I go to the bull-fight and they put me in the bullring.
The bull comes out.
I look at the bull and the bull, he look at me.
The bull he look at me, and I look at the bull.

Juggling.
All we need is a little practice.
We can't afford the plates.
Well-done.
Sit down both of you.
Well Mr. Brown, I think we can cancel all this off.
Oh, please Miss Courtney, the students would be so disappointed.
I mean we still have three days.

Alright, very well.
But remember this Mr. Brown!
Good jobs are hard to find!
Thank you, "the weight watchers."
-I won't do myself- And now Ladies and gentlemen, for your entertainment, hail Mr. Jeremy Brown and his United Nations.
Thank you!
Can they manage without me ?
He can't take care of the kids
Don't worry.
Think of yourself.
Two weeks will go quickly
Will you help your mom ?
...whose onset she can't remember
Microscopic haematuria show up in the tests...
What's the count ?
Three million.
An extra-uterine pregnancy
How was the movie ?
Great.
Thanks for the tip.
Her general health is good...
You'll get used to it...
One gets used to everything.
She clung to life so old and emaciated so crazed look in her eyes
I tried imagining her as a girl.
As a kid I thought old people had allways been old.
That they were born old and lived forever
I'd like to die like that.
Quickly.
Heart stoppage.
Poof !
...right in the middle of a fitting.
What a dream !
Mother dear, we're both crazy !
You never wear the dress I made you.
Don't you like it ?
It's too long to wear to work.
Madame Curie wore long skirts.
And still managed to discover radium.
Ok, I'll will wear you dress.
Have you heard from Jacques ?
Yes, he'll be home on leave in a week.
Tell him I'll fix his favorite chicken and shrimp dinner.
Present arms !
Eyes on the flag.
Chins up !
Stand perfectly still.
That's belt not a jockstrap.
Not too bad.
Let's hear you slap those rifles.
Once more, for Berger.
Quiet, Berger.
Not bad.
Now, a little walk.
Forward march !
Dig in those heels.
You're not a chorus girls.
Legas, you march like a fag.
Miss me ?
Now and then.
Don't let time slip away...
You alone are the tree of life...
Your fate....
Your hope....
Don't put you faith in time...
You're my never again and my forever....
I'm reborn in you...
forever and again...
I'm off-key !
I'm reborn in you, forever and again.
I'm better at songs like: "If your balls hang-high, then show them...
"If your balls hang high, then show them dumdedum."
Subtle, the barracs humor !
You'd better get used to it.
We're real macho in the Army.
Kidding aside...the idiocy is scary.
Dangerous idiocy.
It'll make a man of you.
Oh yeah ?
What am I now ?
You're saving I'm not a man ?
If I get posted near Paris, will you come along ?
I'll follow you anywhere.
Darkest Africa or Paris.
Is Paris likely ?
Not likely, but there's no harm in dreaming.
You should dream about me.
I only dream about barracks.
Now if you wore a uniform...
A had a fine moustache..
I'd love you, Captain, Sir.
The insect lands on a petal just like a runway.
It seeks the nectar deep inside in the flower.
As it goes through this narrow passage it rubs against the reproductive organs and little pouches of pollen stick on its head.
Then the insect carries the pollen to another flower...
It's well organized.
Some orchids do amazing things to attract insects.
They take on the markings...
coloring...of female insects even the smell.
Too bad you stopped studying Botany.
You'd inspire students.
Perhaps it was a mistake...
When delphine was born things became complicated...
Julien was finishing his studies So I sacrificed mine.
I may still do it.
Return to school ?
Maybe...some day.
I'd like to.
I like working at the abbey...
But I prefer to study buttercups.
Moving to Paris is fine with me.
But it means joining a new outfit to work on sophisticated electronic equipment.
Helping the arms race... makes me sick.
Anyone working in electronics must face the problem eventually.
Many people work in armaments without knowing it.
Steel goes into pots and pans and tanks.
You think you're making cook-ware but you're really making tanks.
Where do you draw the line ?
Stop dreaming.
Even household appliances like... vacuum-cleaners need ever more energy meaning nuclear power.
You guys talking fashions as usual ?
You wouldn't understand.
All you know is politics.
Know what Nicole said ?
That I'd have been a great Botany teacher and I was dumb to quit school for you.
That's not what I said.
You've got it all wrong.
When we met you were a mousy student with dull hair
Dirty liar !
I always had incredibly healthy hair.
I said to myself:
"That poor girl needs help."
So I married you.
And before long... you blossomed into a ravishing beauty.
A touching story.
No ?
No.
Actually when we met I was already enchanting and you were going nowhere !
I remember !
What nonsense !
You're dreaming.
You'll be gorgeous when we're married.
Me ?
Marry and buck private ?
Don't even mention the Army.
My soldier boy !
Enough.
May I ?
Just to make them jealous.
She's some knock-out.
Fabulous.
She's leaving.
Where are you heading, sweetie ?
You never make it on that wrack...
Need a push ?
A little push in the ass ?
Some beauty.
Did you see her ass ?
Are you going anywhere special ?
Isn't it boring, being alone ?
Me and my pals could join you.
Do you feel like it ?
Come on...
Be a sport.
She's sulking.
Don't get a little smile ?
You're not funny.
Leave me alone !
My pal's a lousy driver.
Are you hurt ?
You shouldn't be out alone.
Let go !
Dis you enjoy the ride ?
How about a little show ?
A curtain-raiser...
Come on, honey.
Please...
Leave me alone...
How about unveiling your divine figure ?
Wait...do it with style.
Think of your sisters...
We don't have any !
If we did, we'd screw them !
You're mad !
You're out of your minds.
No more talk.
Take it off !
Take it off !
What did my friend say ?
Wil you take it off ?
The blouse...take off your blouse !
Don't cry angel.
Stay cool.
She's knock-out !
I'm cold.
Don't worry we'll warm you up.
It isn't all that bad.
May I ?
Bitch !
Take your skirt off.
Off with it !
What an ass !
...pure poetry.
I'm getting hard as a rock.
Wil you calm down ?
Will you stop that ?
Come and get it, folks !
Stop it !
We're the nicest guys around.
She act like no one's been there before.
She gets around...
the little tease.
Slut !
They start at 12 nowadays.
Soon they'll start in the cradle.
Can't get enough of it, can you ?
Now show us how you treat your pals.
Keep your mouth shut...
Got that ?
Are you hurt ?
She needs a hospital.
No, I know a doctor.
We'll get the biker later.
Nothing seems broken...
Lie down.
Cough.
Turn on your side.
Don't tell anyone...please.
I promise.
Why hide it ?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm ashamed of myself.
I want to die.
You need a couple of days' rest.
Tomorrow I'll be at the clinic.
There's a bed vacant.
You can have it.
I'm sorry...must examine you completely.
Are you on the pill ?
I'll be gentle.
Tell me if it hurts.
Relax.
Clubs
I pass
I win again.
Here, put your idle hands to work.
Open her up.
Don't spill it.
Next time, do it yourself.
Jerk !
This is a tough play.
A delicate move.
Where's the beer ?
Take it easy...
Whose turn is it ?
Pay attention to the game !
Play the dummy.
Don't get nasty.
Who threw the ace ?
Speed up the game...
Let him play his own goddam hand.
Listen to this.
He taped it at the zoo.
Play !
You must have a cock like a mule.
More like tree-trunk.
Assholes !
You don't know anything
Go play with your tree-trunk.
I've played...
It's his turn.
Strange...
For once I'm the one who's sick.
Pulse is normal.
I see you're in good hands.
I'll be leaving.
So soon ?
I've got to get back to my rags.
Careful with that bike from now on.
You should wear a helmet.
How was my acting ?
Perfect...
Thanks.
I found this for you in an old trunk.
I got it in Turkey, a few years ago.
Didn't I tell you ?
Julien's real rock-hound.
Here...they fit together.
We went to Turkey with 2 other nuts...
You're hopeless !
It's not easy.
The countryside was breathtaking...
Most beautiful views in the world.
And they were on all fours...
scratching for rocks for two months.
I'd love a trip like that.
We may go again next year.
You can come along.
That would be great.
I'll ask Jacques on his next leave.
Does he know ?
I'm afraid of his reaction.
Why ?
I don't know.
Listen to me...very carefully.
Let's reverse the roles:
If Jacques was raped by four women, what would you do ?
I'd kill him...that's certain !
How are you ?
What's wrong ?
Those bastards !
...
Swine !
Why didn't I know sooner ?
It wouldn't have helped.
Those cowards !
...
Vermin !
Shit...
But...you were on your bike...
alone...at night...
Is it so unusual ?
How else can I get around ?
What about my work ?
This wasn't for work.
I can't stay home because there are rapists !
I was on my way to Catherine's...
Not through any jungle !
I'm going out to cool off...
I'll be back.
What about me ?
You...me...
It's the same.
Nothing's changed.
You know that.
It's not the same.
You can't understand.
No one can.
My woman...
My love...
My sweet soul...
My weepy spaniel...
My speckled bird...
My lily-white dove...
I'm sorry I get so worked up.
What matters is our love.
Where's the patient ?
It's mine...she's got the flu.
I'm taking care of her myself.
Then I don't have to give her a shot.
I'll go see your mom.
The circus is in town.
I just had to take a look.
The wild animals...
I can't resist them.
Would you try it on for me so I can check something.
Jacques should see you now !
How is he ?
Fair.
The army is no fun.
You make soldiers sound like martyrs, now !
Step forward.
It toughens them up...
makes them strong.
To protect us !
What's the matter ?
Nothing.
Sorry.
I had no time to tidy up.
Tons of work at the office.
How your husband ?
Much better, thanks.
Come help mom make dinner.
You won't need me, will you ?
sorry.
How are you, miss ?
Fine...and you ?
Tip-top !
Can you close the door ?
...
There's a draft.
My last shot.
Too bad.
I enjoyed our little sessions.
Turn over.
Easy now...
I felt that one !
Usually you have a lighter touch.
At her age she can't even peel potatoes !
I've shown her how it's no use.
And her toys !
I give her puppy dolls.
She's not it rested.
She likes football and fighting with boys.
A real tomboy.
I don't like dolls.
How will you learn to take care of your babies ?
When I'm big I'll drive trains.
That's not a girl's job.
Right, miss ?
...
So, won't see you again ?
This was the last visit.
Well goodbay and thanks.
What is it ?
What's wrong ?
I can't go on.
I hate myself.
I feel ugly.
I can't stand being touched.
Nicole, my lovely friend...
lack at me.
I feel so alone.
I'll never get over it.
Of course you will.
It's only natural...after what you've been through...
It can't disappear so quickly.
Give yourself a chance.
Come help me with the garden.
You'll feel better.
Hi, there.
Where's your mom ?
Hi, girls.
How are you ?
You look upset.
I've had some day.
I helped a 1200 pound paraplegic cow back on it's feet, all by myself.
Then Mrs. Fauré's pigs had an emergency.
They had sunstroke !
She was furious.
Sunstroke isn't all that serious for pigs, you know.
I need a shower.
This fabric hurts my eyes.
It's pretty, though.
I lied about the accident.
It wan't true...
I did fall off my bike...
but I had help...
I was pushed off.
By whom ?
I don't know who they are.
What are you saying ?
They abducted me...four guys...
I was taken by force, beaten and raped.
Raped ?
What do you mean ?
I mean just that.
Raped !
Screwed, fucked in the ass !
Bastards !
It look four of them
My poor baby.
Calm down.
How can I ?
All I want is to murder all four of them.
That don't help you.
How could it have happened ?
What can we do ?
I never saw them before.
I don't know them.
And Jacques ?
You told him ?
Of course.
I had to.
You had to ?
You know how men are...
They have their pride.
Sometimes it's best to say nothing.
You think he'd leave me ?
No.
Telling Jacques was O.K.
But it should end there.
It's really nobody's business.
People talk too much.
We've checked this whole area.
We've got two more hours before Delphine gets out of school.
I'd like to find that shed.
Strange...
I'm not sure.
I want to anymore.
I've thought it over.
You should do something.
Take legal action.
Against whom ?
I'll never find them.
How would that help ?
A matter of principle.
You can't let that happen without reacting.
You can pretend nothing happened.
What can I do ?
You've got a medical report.
That's evidence.
You file suit against persons unknown.
Maybe.
I'd rather forget it all.
Some women.
They get raped, beaten, exploited...and they cry.
That's life.
I'd rather forget it.
Now it's all my fault.
Absolutelly !
What's your mom's occupation ?
Mom does the cooking.
My mom doesn't like cooking.
Which drawing is yours ?
This one.
"Mom does lots of things at home."
What does she do ?
She stay home, she works hard.
"Mom cooks, dad works in an office."
Sundays she relaxes...but often she does the dishes.
"Dad reads, mom vacuums."
Are all Sundays like that ?
Not all, but most of them.
You drew that ?
That one's mine.
My dad likes to bowl.
I think we all get raped constantly...on all levels... in our social relationships, our work by those in power.
It's not as dumb as it sounds.
Congratulations !
So ?
We all get raped ?
It's one way of looking at it !
Next to this great universal rape the little rape of Nicole is insignificant !
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to lift this discussion off the ground.
"Off the ground" !
Thanks !
I don't have a way with words, today.
Have some tomatoes... from the garden.
Make room for me.
Marvelous !
Do animals rape each other ?
I was getting to that...
before you interrupted.
We're all ears, hubby, dear.
I was about to say that animals resemble us in the male-female roles but not in terms of rape.
Sex only takes place when the female is in heat, and with her consent.
And other times the males are only mildly interested in sex or not at all.
Whereas you guys are ready anytime, any place.
The laws of nature !
So, bulls are less dangerous than men.
Of course.
Bulls don't see cows as sex-objects.
What'll you do if you find these guys ?
I'm not sure yet.
I know what I would do !
I'd break their heads...
One at a time.
Very smart !
Maybe not.
But I'd fool good.
We can't have you dispensing justice.
Nicole should take legal action.
The cops can do the rest.
No way.
It's their job.
I said:
No.
We 'll handle it ourselves.
It's nobody, else's business.
Don't get mad.
Take it easy.
I'm not mad !
but I will be soon !
We're spending too much time on this.
What's that ?
The cow as a sex-object ?
She's stunning.
That's the second one...
The infection comes from the mother.
Don't feed her for two days.
I'll leave you some medication.
I don't want to cut myself off.
Keeping house can isolate you.
Let's rob a bank.
You're the hostages.
I wanna be a gangster.
Forget it.
You're a teller.
No !
I wanna do the hold-up.
They won't let me be a gangster.
What, sweetheart ?
They won't let me be a gangster.
Let's stop for a cigarette.
Let's walk a little.
What's the rush ?
Sometimes I don't understand you.
I can't stand that any more...
And I can't stand not making love.
It's been two months.
Is that normal ?
What is "normal" ?
There's no prescribed quota.
How about self-control.
That's easier for women than men.
If you say so !
Without getting too philosophical...
I want you...is that such imposition ?
Dummy !
It'll take time and patience.
Do you prefer living on the ground or in the air ?
In the air.
Let's follow them.
You were very brave.
Daddy will be proud of you.
A real little man.
Being scared is normal.
Life has worse things in store.
Tell me your name again.
Sylvie Vertot.
O.K...that's it !
Where does your husband work ?
In a garage, near St. Martin Square.
Our wedding picture.
Five years ago.
I was furious !
...there he was...relaxed...
flirting with a customer ready to do it again.
Exactly.
I can't forget what you said in the car.
I can't pretend it didn't happen.
I should have filed suit.
It's too late now.
It's not.
We can get legal advice.
You still have the medical report ?
Remember I mentioned meeting a young woman at a dinner-party ?
She's a lawyer.
She can advice us.
Let's no waste any more time...
Not just for your sake, for other women,too.
You're right.
I'll ask Jacques on his next leave.
That means another delay...
You don't need Jacques' permission.
You've got wings...fly !
I'll beat the shit out of him !
No, I want all four of them caught.
It happened to me.
You seem to forget that.
OK...
Settle your own score.
I want to take legal action.
That involves me too...since you'll be my wife...
I'll look like an asshole.
What are you saying ?
Your image...your pride...
that's all you worry about ?
An asshole and a rape victim !
The perfect couple !
OK...
I'm old fashioned... tormented...a mass of contradictions.
That's what attracted you.
I'm doing it for you and for me.
Try to understand that.
To get us back together.
I can't let those guys go around raping girls like it was their right.
What do you care ?
Can you change society ?
What would you do ?
How would you solve it ?
Will jail change them ?
There's no easy answer.
We're trapped on all sides.
What a show-off !
You're not at the rodeo.
Shit !
...
What's so funny ?
What a hotshot !
A real Steve McQueen !
A kid I knew smashed up on his bike and died yesterday.
Little brat whose dad bought him an 850cc.
Couldn't ride worth shit.
What's so funny ?
I knew him too.
He was bound to crack up.
Get a load of that piece.
She's something !
I'd love to ream her ass !
Leave it to cowboy.
She acts as if I didn't exist.
She doesn't listen to me.
You're not giving her much support.
For what ?
To put four creeps in jail who'll be worse when they get out ?
We can prevent rape from becoming a national pastime.
By appealing to bourgeois justice ?
Why not use bourgeois justice to expose filth ?
...
That wouldn't make us accomplices.
The laws are made by men, for men.
So we live in a male dominated society !
That's no excuse.
The four creeps go to jail.
When they get out it's the same old world:
sex and violence.
We can't wait for the world to change to take action.
Why should we spare rapists ?
They should be shown their offense is serious.
Will their punishment... really scare those creeps ?
You think they're all sick freaks.
Many aren't like that.
Any could be a rapist...
You...me...him.
I think you want to stop this discussion... because it disturbs you.
Not ta all !
It's for her sake.
Not mine.
She dosn't realize how rough it'll be.
Have it your way.
It was awful.
But now it's over.
No point in insisting.
I think you got raped.
You've read my petition ?
What ?
It's in the kitchen.
It says:
"I'm sick of washing."
How about getting me a washing-machine ?
I'm scared of breaking my little woman.
You don't mind If I break my back doing laundry !
I can't take it any more.
It is a lot of work for those tiny mitts.
Will you be real nice to me ?
I will, if you will.
Do I get the washing-machine ?
You know how to handle me.
A beer !
I got newspapers to deliver.
What about the Zurich airport ?
Some disgrace.
In the newspaper business you get used to bad news.
Taking hostages is revolting.
Cowards...using innocent bystanders.
Disgusting.
The only way to stop them is the death penalty.
It wouln't stop those guys.
They'd think twice.
No if you cut off their heads !
Enough politics.
Pour me a martini.
Sure you want to go through with this ?
It won't be easy.
Cross a criminations investigations, lies even slander.
You might suddenly become the accused...
Look at this cartoon.
"SHE LED US ON", plead men who raped goat.
Sum it all up.
Not far off !
I hesitated a long time...
The legal process scared me.
But now I'm sure.
A silent victim is an accomplice.
I'll see it through.
You're no longer alone.
Our goal is not to jail these men.
But to speak out and break this wall of silence.
It seems like conspiracy of silence...
It's too disturbing...
Do you carry burlap ?
Of course.
Jean-Louis, help this lady.
Where's the burlap ?
You should know where.
Where is your burlap ?
He can shove it !
That's no way to talk !
What do you mean my burlap...
"My" burlap fed you and put you through school !
You heard that, Madame ?
Without "my" burlap you'd be in a factory.
So get off your high horse !
Here's the burlap...
Right under your nose, dummy.
You won't find the price on it.
You're supposed to know the price.
Use your head once in a while.
Our future book-keeper !
Such a son !
Why is God punishing me ?
That boy is a half-wit.
Guess why !
Because we didn't belt you enough.
That's why !
It's only just starting.
It'll go on for years.
Questions, investigations, gossip.
I know.
What about your job ?
Your patients will love it !
Please, stop.
Jacques is right why spread it around ?
It's not for the fun of it.
It's no one's business.
You're wrong.
It's eneryone's business.
What good will it do ?
Jacques is fine young man.
People respect him.
That's important.
The dirt will rub off on you.
I'll get married in white to look cleaner.
Anyway, you won't win.
Why not ?
That's how it is, how it's always been.
You're not the first nor the last woman to get raped.
Life is violent... and you can't change human nature.
Stop it !
Things have to change.
Why accept everything ?
Listen to yourself...
You're so passive.
I'm ashamed of you.
Then get out !
You've become tough.
You've changed.
You're all against me.
You don't understand.
We understand things differently.
Name ?
Sorel.
First name ?
Nicole.
Age ?
25.
Occupation ?
Nurse.
Married ?
No.
Address ?
10 Rue Victor Hugo.
Now give me a full statement.
I was on my way to visit friends.
I stopped in a café to buy cigarettes.
Those men were there.
That was your first time in that café ?
Yes, the first time.
When did you notice them ?
As I left.
They made some comments.
It happened very fast.
What sort of comments ?
You know...the usual ones...
Remember anything specific ?
"Want a push in the ass ?", things like that.
All four were there ?
I only saw two.
You're sure the other two weren't there ?
I only saw two then... but there were people outside.
You're sure they're the men ?
How could I forget ?
Here, sign these.
"All's well, great weather, blue skies."
"Blue skies, great weather, all's well."
"Great weather, blue skies, all's well."
"Blue weather, well skies, all's great."
What talent !
Shall we eat ?
Let's kill the bottle !
I've had enough.
To the Army !
Captain, Sir.
All good things must end !
Will you miss it ?
No.
Now I'm an adult.
Yesterday I was at Yves' office.
His four-year old son looked at the maps and drawings on the walls and said:
"So that's what life is like !"
"Is that really life ?"
I must talk to you.
I'm all ears.
I'd rather be all arms...
I'm serious.
Go ahead.
I'm taking legal action.
Not that again !
I thought we were through with that.
We aren't.
It's been 6 months !
I thought you understood:
we're together...
Yes...together...
But we don't think alike.
You're smart..try to understand...
That you're right ?
Don't treat me like an enemy.
I can't reach you.
Where do I fit in ?
You talk like you're the victim.
You and your humanitarian speeches...
Always defending the oppressed.
I forbid you to take action.
If you do, I'm through.
Choose me or that filth.
I did.
Last Friday.
You did what ?
I made a formal complaint to the police.
That's it.
You're on your own.
I'll take you home.
We'd had some grain dust looking fo laughs...
Tell that to the judge.
We got carried away...
You're a man.You know...
It's your mess not mine.
Why only question me ?
Don't worry.
Your pals are next once you help us find them.
Jean-Louis Garand ?
That's me.
Police.
Come along.
What do they want with you ?
I'll be right back.
It's just a formality.
I'll get Dad.
No don't !
I'll be back.
Come along.
Wait...your coat !
It'll be all right.
I'll call you tonight.
JUDGE'S CHAMBERS.
Why didn't you file a complaint sooner ?
At first I wanted to forget the whole thing.
A mistake.
But when I found one of them I made up my mind.
The men say you smiled at them in the café that you indicated consent.
I was abducted beaten and raped.
There was no consent.
It's unwise to be out alone at night on a deserted road.
I can't stay shut in because of rapist !
I was going to visit friends.
The world is full of violence.
One must remembered that.
And submit to it ?
No.
But we can't change the world.
Why not ?
These young men claim it was a game at first for you, too.
Certain attitudes may encourage...
What attitudes ?
Women must be very careful.
Sometimes they play with fire.
But I ignored them completly.
The boundary between consent and non-consent is vague.
Even a glance can be misinterpreted.
Your honor.
Who is the accused ?
They or I ?
Don't let my questions upset you.
My job is to find out.
I know it's unpleasant, but it's necessary.
I already told the police.
You filed a complaint.
The men are defending themselves.
I'm trying establish the truth.
Now, let's put some order info this.
I'll dictate your statement.
And If it isn't exactly... what you want to say, stop me.
Take this down.
"On Saturday, July 9, 1977 at about 7 PM.
"I was riding my motorcycle...
"...to the home of my friends Julien and Catherine Buissard...
"to spend the evening with them...
Bye.
See you soon.
Seen the X Ray ?
Shelft need suction.
Alert the intensive care unit...
And you ?
How are you doing ?
Fine.
But it's not easy.
I'm here, if you need help.
WHAT ABOUT ME ?
Yes...about six o'clock, near the hospital ?
Ok, I'll be there.
I said to myself:
"What can you lose ?"
You were right.
It must be awful for you.
I really don't understand...
We were so happy together...
What will happen to us ?
He'll lose his job, everything...
All I know is how to raise kids.
Help me.
How can I ?
Drop the charges.
I can't
They were wrong...anyone can make a mistake...
They went too far...
Didn't you ever ?
Think of my kids.
If their father goes to jail, you destroy four lives.
I can't reverse the process.
It would be wrong...
Not only for myself... but for other women.
Other women !
Big words !
I'm a woman, too.
Female solidarity !
You have no permanent injuries...
no broken bones.
Help me !
You don't know how it felt...
it was hell.
You don't understand.
I can't drop the charges.
It's your petty pride !
Your conceit.
What a production !
Just 'cause you got screwed !
It didn't kill you...
But my life is ruined !
What'll I tell my kids ?
You don't give a damn, do you ?
This is my wife.
Come along, please.
It's quieter here.
Sorry, I don't have much time.
A terrible business !
But good will can work miracles.
I'm a pragmatist.
I don't shirk my duties.
My husband can solve anything.
Our son behaved like a half-wit.
A thug.
That's how he repays all our sacrifices !
We gave him everything !
Forget the past...
Let's talk about the future.
I hear you're getting married.
Theoretically...
A young couple, building the little nest...
It takes money... the house...
The furniture...
We'd like you to forgive us... and to accept...
May I ask...how much is my ass worth ?
Save your breath...
I won't drop the charges.
It's your pride...
It's not pride !
Getting raped is no accident.
Do I get raped ?
Listen to me.
The world is one big dung of fornication.
With three billion inhabitants... how many loads get shot off every night ?
Millions !
With or without consent.
What's your little rape ?
A drop in the bucket !
Let's go.
We'll discuss that later.
All five of you are in the van, heading for the woods.
Why there ?
You know the ares ?
My folks own a house nearby.
You reach your destination...
You drag the young lady in front of the van.
You proceed to remove her clothes.
It was just for kicks...
She didn't seem to mind !
That's a lie !
Girls always do that...
They're all for it, they lead you on.
Afterwards they say you went too far.
She "led you on"...
Everything "leds you on."
If she smiles at you...
If she doesn't smile at you...
If she's alone in a café...the way she dresses...it all "leads you on".
There are unmistakable signals...
Even if you were "led on"... you're old enough to control yourselves.
You're not barbarians !
One of you is married, with a family.
And you set the example !
We made love, that's all...
Wasn't her first time, either.
Her fiancé has a good deal !
Don't you dare talk about my private life !
You seedy little...
Enough !
...
Just answer my questions.
You consider that your behavior was "normal" ?
Maybe we went a bit far...
It's hard to stay cool when you're teased.
Rape is a criminal offense.
If rape it was !
The victim seems in fine shape.
Your remarks are out of order.
True...it didn't kill me...
I'm sorry.
You still haven't heard from Jacques ?
It was an ordeal for him, too.
It'll work out, you'll see.
I might have reacted the same way.
We're not as liberated as we think.
He should have stayed.
Is the re-enactment on Wednesday ?
You want us to come ?
I'd rather go alone.
I'll manage...
I'd better !
Remove their handcuffs.
They made me get out.
I tried to escape, but they caught me.
Were the headlights on ?
You all agree ?
Then turn them on.
What happened next ?
I tried to talk them out of it.
I couldn't.
He led me into the headlights...
he made me undress.
It was a harmless game.
We all played it.
Show me.
The young lady stood there ?
She stripped for us.
They forced me to.
You undressed yourself ?
Yes, I did...
After they punched and slapped me.
You took off your own skirt !
You know you forced me to !
But you turned us on !
We're only men !
Who hit you first ?
Keep moving.
I must speak with someone...
Make way.
In the last episode of Soap,
Elaine was kidnapped and therefore has disappeared.
Eunice and Dutch, in order to disappear from the police, have disappeared to a farm.
Burt and Mary still haven't talked, and so their suspicions about each other haven't disappeared, and Chester, who still doesn't know who he is, has just up and disappeared.
Confused?
You won't be after this week's episode of...
This is the story of two sisters,
Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.
These are the Tates... and these are the Campbells.
And this is Soap.
"We have your wife.
"Don't call police,
"or you'll never see her alive again.
You will be notified of our plans."
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.
I mean, why would anybody want to kidnap Elaine?
The money, Burt, they'd do it for the money.
Danny, I know that, but why us?
We don't have any money.
There's only one thing to do.
Who are you calling?
The police.
No, Ma, we can't call the police.
Didn't you read what the note said?
"Do not call the police."
Danny, come on, what'd you expect them to write?
"We've got your wife.
Please call the police."
Hey, what is all the racket in here?
Do you guys know what time it is?
Chuck, there's a reason why we're all up.
Yeah, well, this had better be good.
Elaine has been kidnapped.
And?
And?
What do you mean, "and"?
How can you say, "and"?
Come on.
Read.
Hey, Dan, I'm sorry.
Listen, why don't I go down and make us all some coffee or something, huh?
Good idea, Chuck.
Hey, listen, don't worry, Dan.
I mean, after a couple of days with Elaine, they'll pay you to take her back.
Danny, we have got to call the police.
Wait a minute.
Hello.
Mr. Lefkowitz?
It's Elaine's father.
Mr. Lefkowitz, I'm afraid that I have some very bad news.
We have a little...
Hmm?
No, business is good.
What, hey, couldn't be better.
All right.
Mr. Lefkowitz,
Elaine...
That's terrific.
Good old Reggie.
Reggie?
Reggie?
Reggie who?
He put the Yankees in the series.
He made a fortune.
Give me that phone!
Mr. Lefkowitz, this is Danny.
Mr. Lefkowitz, I have some terrible news.
Elaine has been kidnapped.
That is the terrible news.
You know?
He knows.
The kidnappers called him first.
How much?
250,000 bucks?
That's almost a quarter of a million dollars.
What?
What do you mean you won't pay it?
He won't pay it?
But she's your own...
Yeah, but Mr. Lef...
No, but...
Listen, listen, you rotten, scum-sucking pig...
I'm going to come over there and rip your brains out!
Listen.
Why did you do that?
Danny, he's a gangster.
He could kill you.
How are you going to keep Elaine alive if you're dead?
Okay, okay, but if he doesn't pay,
Elaine doesn't stand a chance.
Now, where are we going to get that kind of money?
Danny, I have some money put away.
It's yours.
And I figure we can borrow maybe, what, $25,000, and then we can bargain them down a couple of hundred thousand dollars.
Don't worry, Danny.
We'll get her back.
That's the phone, that's the phone!
What did you do with the phone?
Look.
Up there!
Yeah.
Yeah, this is him.
It's them.
Paper, pencil.
Come on.
Pencil, pencil.
Pencil.
Paper, paper.
Paper, paper.
Yeah, I've got a pencil.
Go ahead.
Boardwalk!
I don't want it.
You're not going to buy Boardwalk?
No.
Why?
When you put a hotel on it, and I land there,
I'll have to pay a fortune.
No, you won't.
I won't charge you.
Ma, that's against the rules.
Mrs. Tate...
Mrs. Tate, what is going on here?
Monopoly.
No, no, no, that's not what I mean.
I'm upstairs cleaning your bathroom, and a guy walks out of the shower fully dressed.
Oh, that must be Detective Donohue.
Well, what is he doing here?
Looking for Chester.
Well, I think if Mr. Tate was in the shower, we would have found him by now.
I'd say it was my most difficult case.
First of all, the body was in seven different states... arm in Alabama, leg in Wisconsin, the head in Rhode Island.
It took months to put the pieces together.
You put all the pieces together?
Sure.
This guy is amazing.
Not really.
It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle.
You've got a bunch of parts, it don't mean anything.
Put them together, get a perfect picture.
Only difference is the pieces I'm playing with are bloody, and the picture I get don't make Bambi in the end.
Okay, Mrs. Tate, I'm done.
Good.
Does that mean that you're going to take the case?
I'm not sure yet.
Oh.
I see your husband likes to dress up like a priest.
Kinky.
My husband was a priest.
Congratulations on your pregnancy.
How did you know?
The saltines and the Rocky Road ice cream by your bed.
Billy...
It's a nice collection of magazines you've got hidden in your bedroom.
Why don't you get yourself a girlfriend?
I'm trying, I'm trying.
Try a little harder.
I see your daughter, Eunice, ran off with Dutch Lightner, who you hid in the basement.
Amazing.
Billy, did you tell?
No, I swear.
Nobody told me anything, Mrs. Tate.
Everything is there.
All you have to do is look for it.
Amazing.
Benson, can I get a cup of coffee?
No.
Good, it makes me jumpy as hell.
Now, getting back to your husband's disappearance,
I get these cases all the time.
Find them all.
You name them, I've found them.
Amelia Earhart.
Found her...
shopping.
Martin Bormann, found him too.
Sells Mercedes in Malibu.
I find these cases very boring.
I find you very boring.
If it's so boring, why do you do it?
What am I gonna do?
Heart transplants?
It's what I know.
Well, they say that you are the best detective in the world.
And they're right.
One thing I had to know, Mrs. Tate:
did your husband leave willfully?
Because if your husband left willfully, why should I bother to find him?
Oh, dear.
Do you think that's possible?
No.
Good.
I don't think any man in his right mind would leave a wife like you.
Oh, Detective Donohue, you're very sweet.
No, I'm not, Mrs. Tate, just doing my job.
Does that mean you're going to take the case?
Only for one reason.
What's that?
I like your smile.
Yes?
May I come in?
Oh, yes, Mrs. Tate.
We're all finished.
Oh, good.
Doctor, I am so glad that you're a lady gynecologist.
It makes it so much easier to come here.
So how is Corinne?
Corinne is a fine, healthy, pregnant young lady.
I know.
But, doctor, how come I'm so big at three weeks?
That doesn't seem normal.
Because you miscalculated, Corinne.
You're not three weeks pregnant.
You're five months pregnant.
Uh-oh.
But that's impossible.
I've only been married a month.
I understand, Corinne, but nowadays, lots of girls have sex while they're engaged.
Not if you're engaged to a priest.
Do you mean to tell me that you and your husband never had sex?
Never.
Well, then, what about before your husband?
When was the last time?
Well, that would have been Peter...
But I'm not exactly sure when that was.
Could Peter recall the date?
Oh, I don't think so.
He's dead.
Oh.
My husband killed him.
But it couldn't have been Peter, because he's been dead for over six months.
Then there must have been someone between Peter and your husband.
There was no one.
Think, Corinne.
Ma, I swear there was no one.
There was Peter, and then there was Tim after we were married, but otherwise, there was no one, absolutely no one, I swear it.
Well, then,
I don't know how to explain this.
Doctor... perhaps it was from a public bathroom.
That can't happen, Mrs. Tate.
What about a swimming pool?
I'm afraid not.
Because I saw this cartoon once with a little talking sperm who said he was a terrific swimmer.
It was very cute, really.
The little sperm was all light blue and wore swim trunks...
And the little eggs were all pink and had little earrings on.
Of course, I don't imagine that's the way they really look.
It's not from a pool,
Mrs. Tate.
There is really only one way to get pregnant.
Well, I'm out of ideas.
Good.
Now, Corinne, if what you say is true, that there was no one between Peter and Tim,
I don't know what to tell you.
You have the uterus of a normal five months' pregnancy.
Is there anything unusual you've noticed lately?
Yes, there is.
I know this might sound a little strange, but sometimes, I hear humming when there's no one else in the room, and it seems to come from my stomach.
Oh, that's hunger, Corinne.
I get that too.
It kind of rumbles.
Uh, no, Ma, this is different.
This isn't a rumbling.
This is a tune:
"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head."
Maybe Burt Bacharach is the father.
Oh, dear.
What is it?
Well, I guess this means
I have to tell Tim that I'm pregnant.
Well, yes.
When you go into labor,
I think he's going to be suspicious.
But I've only been married a month.
How can I tell him I'm five months pregnant?
Well, Corinne, you'll just have to tell him.
I mean, what is he going to say?
"See you."
Okay, fellows, let's try and get it this time, okay?
Okay?
Before the milk curdles?
All right, is tape rolling?
Thank you.
Quiet, everybody.
Here we go, and...

Hey, man, don't be calling me a jerk.
All right, cut.
Cut.
Fellows, we've been here since 7:30 this morning.
How about it, huh?
He's splashing in my eye.
You were jumping up and down.
I didn't splash on you.
Yes, you did.
All right, hold it, hold it.
Fellows, listen.
We're selling happy raisins and peppy flakes here, and it's not playing happy and peppy.
Oh, yeah?
What's the problem?
Seems to be a little too much hate coming through.
Seems to be dissipating the happy and the peppy.
You know what I'm saying?
Let's roll tape, please.
Now, remember to tap Rodney on the head after you've finished the song.
He can't hear you underneath all that milk.
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
Now give me a little happy, peppy, bouncing up and down.
That's it, good.
Use it, hmm?
Rodney, under the milk, please.
Here we go.
Don't forget to tap.
Don't forget not to splash.
Okay... action.

Psst, Jodie.
Are you gonna pay attention here?
Yeah, I'm...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Stop tape, please.
Listen, Carol, I'm really sorry.
I didn't get a chance to call you.
This is taking a lot longer than I thought, and I'm going to have to work right through lunch.
Jodie, I think that, uh...
I think we should call off the wedding.
Well, I should be through by then.
Who's going to come?
Oh, Elaine has been kidnapped, and Burt and Danny are out looking for her, and Eunice has run off with Dutch, and Chester is missing, and Jessica's worried sick, and your mother is miserable over Burt's affair.
It's going to be you and me and Bernstein, the caterer.
Hiya, Mr. Peppy Flake.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
Rodney, Rodney, what's the problem?
He didn't tap me.
Now, look, man, I'm not a mackerel.
I'm a raisin.
So either you hire Flipper or get me an aqua lung.
Okay, calm down.
Everything will be okay.
I need this.
I have a hostile raising here.
Now, listen, Carol, I know there are a lot of problems, but everybody wants us to go through with it.
It'll make them happy, and they need to feel a little happy these days.
Yoo-hoo, remember us?
Yeah, fellows, listen, I'm very sorry about this.
You're sorry?
I've been in this milk for four hours.
I'm starting to wrinkle.
Terrific.
A good raisin's supposed to be wrinkled.
All right, let's roll tape, please.
Let's get it this time, huh?
All right, now, listen.

Carol...
Well, what a... surprise.
Uh...
Dennis, what are you doing here?
Jodie, I've been wanting to talk to you, but you never return my phone calls.
Get the hint?
Look...
Coffee, huh?
How about a nice hot cup of coffee?
Jodie...
I can't let you just walk out of my life.
Dennis, I'm marrying Carol.
Jodie, I've thought it over.
I'll give up football.
I'll come out.
I'll do anything.
I'll tell the world I'm gay.
I think you just did.
Can we turn that off, please?
Thank you.
Dennis, that's the way it is.
I'm marrying Carol.
But I thought if I gave up football, we wouldn't have to sneak around...
Dennis, it won't make any difference.
That's the way it is.
We're finished.
Finished?
Finished.
Finished.
Sounds so final.
Okay, Jodie.
I'm sorry.
I won't bother you again.
Are you sure you want to go through with the wedding?
Absolutely.
You?
Mm-hmm.
This is very touching.
Sick, but touching.
Uh, fellows.
I'm sorry.
Let's get back to work, okay?
Hey, Jodie, is it really over between you and Dennis?
Yeah.
Then you don't mind if I give him a call, do you?
Where are the cops?
They're around.
They're here.
Don't look, don't look.
Where are they?
I don't see any cops.
Danny, please, they're not going to wear their uniforms.
They're in disguise.
Oh.
Don't look.
Where?
"Where" what?
Where are they in their disguises?
There's one right over there.
Where?
Don't look.
There's no cop over there.
There's just an old lady over there, and she's feeding the pigeons.
Don't look.
That's the cop.
It's undercover.
I saw it on Baretta.
Oh.
Don't look.
Are you sure we're in the right place?
Yeah, I'm sure.
They said the phone booth by the elm tree.
Is that cop still there?
I don't think that old lady's a cop.
Why not?
She just mugged somebody.
Maybe the victim's the cop.
Maybe.
Come on, where's that call?
Danny, listen, Danny, I've been thinking.
I've been thinking that maybe I should talk to the kidnappers when they call, because you're getting too emotional.
I am not.
Danny, yes, you are.
I am not.
You are.
Hey, listen, it's my wife!
All right, listen, Danny, come over here.
Listen, now, I need you.
Calm down.
Okay.
Listen to me.
Pay attention.
Hear the sound of my voice.
It's important.
I'm going crazy, Burt.
That ringing is driving me nuts.
The ringing!
Listen, Danny...
Burt, you ran right over me.
The phone!
Get out of there.
BOTH:
Hello!
All right.
All right, we're in the phone booth near the elm tree, just like you said, but we don't have the money.
Be nice.
Apologize for not having it.
Okay, okay.
Look, I just can't raise that kind of money.
Listen, listen, you lousy creep, if I get my hands on...
Hello.
Hi.
This is Burt Campbell,
Danny's stepfather.
Listen, we are...
We just...
He's a little overwrought.
You've got to forgive him.
And, now, we don't have $250,000.
Come up with it?
What do you want me to do?
Rob a bank?
"Yes," he says, "yes."
I've got a comic over here.
Listen, you lousy piece of filth, if you touch a hair...
Hello.
Sir?
Yes, it's me.
Uh, I'm sorry, we can't come up with $250,000, but we do have $25,000.
Uh, when you're finished laughing, sir, maybe we can do a little business here.
All right, this is Danny.
Now, listen, guys like me are real suckers paying blood money to vermin like you.
If none of us ever paid, you'd be out of business, so my only and final offer is 50,000.
Take it or leave it, and if I ever get my hands on you,
I'm going to rip your heart out.
Oh, good, that's great.
Ripping hearts.
That'll warm him up.
I used to work with criminals.
I know how to talk to them.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Okay, we'll be there, and we're gonna want to talk to Elaine before we pay anything.
Hey, that was incredible, Danny.
That was strong and forceful...
And stupid.
Where are we going to get 50,000 bucks?
I don't know.
It's gonna be a little tough to raise.
It's gonna be even tougher from in here.
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
Danny, use your head.
The phone.
Oh, you've got some money?
Sure.
Break a five?
How will Burt and Danny find $50,000?
And will they find $50,000 if they can't find their way out of the telephone booth?
And if they can't find their way out of the telephone booth and find $50,000, how will they ever find Elaine?
What will Tim do when he finds out what Corinne found out, that she is five months pregnant?
Since they've only been married a month, will he find that difficult to believe?
Now that Dennis has found out Jodie intends to marry Carol, will Jodie find he has second thoughts?
Will Detective Donohue find Chester?
Does he want to find Chester?
These questions and many others will be answered on the next episode of...
Soap.
Soap is videotaped before a studio audience.
In the last episode of Soap,
Elaine was kidnapped and therefore has disappeared.
Eunice and Dutch, in order to disappear from the police, have disappeared to a farm.
Burt and Mary still haven't talked, and so their suspicions about each other haven't disappeared, and Chester, who still doesn't know who he is, has just up and disappeared.
Confused?
You won't be after this week's episode of...
This is the story of two sisters,
Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.
These are the Tates... and these are the Campbells.
And this is Soap.
[SHOUTING AND ARGUING]
"We have your wife.
"Don't call police,
"or you'll never see her alive again.
You will be notified of our plans."
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.
I mean, why would anybody want to kidnap Elaine?
The money, Burt, they'd do it for the money.
Danny, I know that, but why us?
We don't have any money.
There's only one thing to do.
Who are you calling?
The police.
No, Ma, we can't call the police.
Didn't you read what the note said?
"Do not call the police."
Danny, come on, what'd you expect them to write?
"We've got your wife.
Please call the police."
Hey, what is all the racket in here?
Do you guys know what time it is?
Chuck, there's a reason why we're all up.
Yeah, well, this had better be good.
Elaine has been kidnapped.
And?
And?
What do you mean, "and"?
How can you say, "and"?
Come on.
Read.
Hey, Dan, I'm sorry.
Listen, why don't I go down and make us all some coffee or something, huh?
Good idea, Chuck.
Hey, listen, don't worry, Dan.
I mean, after a couple of days with Elaine, they'll pay you to take her back.
Danny, we have got to call the police.
Wait a minute.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
Hello.
Mr. Lefkowitz?
It's Elaine's father.
Mr. Lefkowitz, I'm afraid that I have some very bad news.
We have a little...
Hmm?
No, business is good.
What, hey, couldn't be better.
All right.
Mr. Lefkowitz,
Elaine...
That's terrific.
Good old Reggie.
Reggie?
Reggie?
Reggie who?
He put the Yankees in the series.
He made a fortune.
Give me that phone!
Mr. Lefkowitz, this is Danny.
Mr. Lefkowitz, I have some terrible news.
Elaine has been kidnapped.
That is the terrible news.
You know?
He knows.
The kidnappers called him first.
How much?
250,000 bucks?
That's almost a quarter of a million dollars.
What?
What do you mean you won't pay it?
He won't pay it?
But she's your own...
Yeah, but Mr. Lef...
No, but...
Listen, listen, you rotten, scum-sucking pig...
I'm going to come over there and rip your brains out!
Listen.
Why did you do that?
Danny, he's a gangster.
He could kill you.
How are you going to keep Elaine alive if you're dead?
Okay, okay, but if he doesn't pay,
Elaine doesn't stand a chance.
Now, where are we going to get that kind of money?
Danny, I have some money put away.
It's yours.
And I figure we can borrow maybe, what, $25,000, and then we can bargain them down a couple of hundred thousand dollars.
Don't worry, Danny.
We'll get her back.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
That's the phone, that's the phone!
What did you do with the phone?
Look.
Up there!
Yeah.
Yeah, this is him.
It's them.
Paper, pencil.
Come on.
Pencil, pencil.
Pencil.
Paper, paper.
Paper, paper.
[COOLLY] Yeah, I've got a pencil.
Go ahead.
[DICE ROLLING]
Boardwalk!
I don't want it.
You're not going to buy Boardwalk?
No.
Why?
When you put a hotel on it, and I land there,
I'll have to pay a fortune.
No, you won't.
I won't charge you.
Ma, that's against the rules.

He can't hear you underneath all that milk.
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
Now give me a little happy, peppy, bouncing up and down.
That's it, good.
Use it, hmm?
Rodney, under the milk, please.
Here we go.
Don't forget to tap.
Don't forget not to splash.
Okay... action.
♪ Hello I'm Mr. Peppy Flake ♪
♪ I used to be... ♪
[WHISPERING] Psst, Jodie.
Are you gonna pay attention here?
Yeah, I'm...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Stop tape, please.
Listen, Carol, I'm really sorry.
I didn't get a chance to call you.
This is taking a lot longer than I thought, and I'm going to have to work right through lunch.
Jodie, I think that, uh...
I think we should call off the wedding.
Well, I should be through by then.
Who's going to come?
Oh, Elaine has been kidnapped, and Burt and Danny are out looking for her, and Eunice has run off with Dutch, and Chester is missing, and Jessica's worried sick, and your mother is miserable over Burt's affair.
It's going to be you and me and Bernstein, the caterer.
Hiya, Mr. Peppy Flake.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
Rodney, Rodney, what's the problem?
He didn't tap me.
Now, look, man, I'm not a mackerel.
I'm a raisin.
So either you hire Flipper or get me an aqua lung.
Okay, calm down.
Everything will be okay.
I need this.
I have a hostile raising here.
Now, listen, Carol, I know there are a lot of problems, but everybody wants us to go through with it.
It'll make them happy, and they need to feel a little happy these days.
Yoo-hoo, remember us?
Yeah, fellows, listen, I'm very sorry about this.
You're sorry?
I've been in this milk for four hours.
I'm starting to wrinkle.
Terrific.
A good raisin's supposed to be wrinkled.
[LAUGHING]
All right, let's roll tape, please.
Let's get it this time, huh?
All right, now, listen.
Trust me, everything is going to be okay.
All right, let's get it, D.J., huh, please?
Thank you.
Quiet, everybody.
Rodney, under the milk, please.
Action.
♪ Hello I'm Mr. Peppy Flake ♪
♪ I used to be A schleppy flake... ♪
Hold it, wait.
Don't anyone move.
What's the trouble now?
I lost a contact.
All right, now, I've got it.
Just a second.
All right, steady.
Hiya, Mr. Peppy Flake.
Now you're going to die!
[ALL SHOUTING]
Cut.
Cut!
Hey, hold it.
Take five, everybody.
Hi.
Oh, just what the cereal needed:
fruit.
Carol...
[STUTTERING]
Well, what a... surprise.
Uh...
Dennis, what are you doing here?
Jodie, I've been wanting to talk to you, but you never return my phone calls.
Get the hint?
Look...
Coffee, huh?
How about a nice hot cup of coffee?
Jodie...
[SIGHS]
I can't let you just walk out of my life.
Dennis, I'm marrying Carol.
Jodie, I've thought it over.
I'll give up football.
I'll come out.
I'll do anything.
I'll tell the world I'm gay.
I think you just did.
Can we turn that off, please?
Thank you.
Dennis, that's the way it is.
I'm marrying Carol.
But I thought if I gave up football, we wouldn't have to sneak around...
Dennis, it won't make any difference.
That's the way it is.
We're finished.
Finished?
Finished.
Finished.
Sounds so final.
Okay, Jodie.
I'm sorry.
I won't bother you again.
Are you sure you want to go through with the wedding?
Absolutely.
You?
Mm-hmm.
This is very touching.
Sick, but touching.
Uh, fellows.
I'm sorry.
Let's get back to work, okay?
Hey, Jodie, is it really over between you and Dennis?
Yeah.
Then you don't mind if I give him a call, do you?
[♪]
Where are the cops?
They're around.
They're here.
Don't look, don't look.
Where are they?
I don't see any cops.
Danny, please, they're not going to wear their uniforms.
They're in disguise.
Oh.
Don't look.
Where?
"Where" what?
Where are they in their disguises?
There's one right over there.
Where?
Don't look.
There's no cop over there.
There's just an old lady over there, and she's feeding the pigeons.
Don't look.
That's the cop.
It's undercover.
I saw it on Baretta.
Oh.
Don't look.
Are you sure we're in the right place?
Yeah, I'm sure.
They said the phone booth by the elm tree.
Is that cop still there?
I don't think that old lady's a cop.
Why not?
She just mugged somebody.
Maybe the victim's the cop.
Maybe.
Come on, where's that call?
Danny, listen, Danny, I've been thinking.
I've been thinking that maybe I should talk to the kidnappers when they call, because you're getting too emotional.
I am not.
Danny, yes, you are.
I am not.
You are.
Hey, listen, it's my wife!
All right, listen, Danny, come over here.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
Listen, now, I need you.
Calm down.
Okay.
Listen to me.
Pay attention.
Hear the sound of my voice.
It's important.
I'm going crazy, Burt.
That ringing is driving me nuts.
The ringing!
[GRUNTING]
Listen, Danny...
Burt, you ran right over me.
The phone!
Get out of there.
BOTH:
Hello!
All right.
All right, we're in the phone booth near the elm tree, just like you said, but we don't have the money.
Be nice.
Apologize for not having it.
Okay, okay.
Look, I just can't raise that kind of money.
Listen, listen, you lousy creep, if I get my hands on...
[SLOW, CALM VOICE] Hello.
Hi.
This is Burt Campbell,
Danny's stepfather.
Listen, we are...
We just...
He's a little overwrought.
You've got to forgive him.
And, now, we don't have $250,000.
Come up with it?
What do you want me to do?
Rob a bank?
"Yes," he says, "yes."
I've got a comic over here.
Listen, you lousy piece of filth, if you touch a hair...
[SLOW, CALM VOICE] Hello.
Sir?
Yes, it's me.
Uh, I'm sorry, we can't come up with $250,000, but we do have $25,000.
Uh, when you're finished laughing, sir, maybe we can do a little business here.
All right, this is Danny.
Now, listen, guys like me are real suckers paying blood money to vermin like you.
If none of us ever paid, you'd be out of business, so my only and final offer is 50,000.
Take it or leave it, and if I ever get my hands on you,
I'm going to rip your heart out.
Oh, good, that's great.
Ripping hearts.
That'll warm him up.
I used to work with criminals.
I know how to talk to them.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Okay, we'll be there, and we're gonna want to talk to Elaine before we pay anything.
Hey, that was incredible, Danny.
That was strong and forceful...
And stupid.
Where are we going to get 50,000 bucks?
I don't know.
It's gonna be a little tough to raise.
[DOOR RATTLING]
It's gonna be even tougher from in here.
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
Danny, use your head.
The phone.
Oh, you've got some money?
Sure.
Break a five?
[♪]
How will Burt and Danny find $50,000?
And will they find $50,000 if they can't find their way out of the telephone booth?
And if they can't find their way out of the telephone booth and find $50,000, how will they ever find Elaine?
What will Tim do when he finds out what Corinne found out, that she is five months pregnant?
Since they've only been married a month, will he find that difficult to believe?
Now that Dennis has found out Jodie intends to marry Carol, will Jodie find he has second thoughts?
Will Detective Donohue find Chester?
Does he want to find Chester?
These questions and many others will be answered on the next episode of...
Soap.
Soap is videotaped before a studio audience.

Moomintroll and the others
Based on the Tove Jansson's story "Comet In Moominland"
Film first
There once a long way away to the north in the blue valley were living the family of Moomintrolls...
I am, Moomintroll Senior, begining to write memoirs about how I am and my family...
Ah-h-h...
Moomintroll.
Yes, daddy.
Tell me, what is a memoirs?
This is when kitty's miaowing.
Miaow-moris.
And what are you thinking, Sniff?
This is when the cow's mooing.
Moo-moo-oiris.
He-he, no-o...
The memoirs is the reminiscences.
I am begining to write the reminiscences.
So, I'm reminiscing about myself having sat down to write the memoirs.
My wife, Moominmamma, as now as I remember, was cooking dinner.
Eh-eh, what will we have for dinner?
There'll be pasties with apples.
Aha, we'll have pies with apples for the dinner,
I've been remembring.
What a good miaow-moris.
What a delicious moo-moo-oiris.
And write the reminiscences what will be for supper.
Who will be fooling around they will be taken by Groke dreadful and terrible one.
What is it?
Agh-r-r!
Come here!
This is the Hobgoblin.
A relative of ours.
Howdy!
How do you do.
Grandaddy, any tea or coffee for you?
One plate of tea, one plate of coffee.
And not a single drop more, I am in a hurry.
And what happened?
A fire?
A world catastrophe?
On the contrary.
This evening a public holiday happened out of nowhere.
For evrybody.
Eh-h, where?
Where will be more funny there will be public holiday.
It's all.
Ciao cocao!
Let's start running to chose where is more funny.
I know one road... that is... a mysterious way
It's leads to not known where.
I like when I'm strolling
Then I'm waging my tail
Then I am, Then I am
Never being bored ever.
Moomin, look!
Here is it, the mysterious way!
Are they ghosts or no?
It seemed... to me that this is...
Groke dreadful and terrible one.
Ah, it's a nonsense.
Water.
Sea!
And what is this?
The lighthouse, probably.
Let's go to swim.
I won't go!
Wanting to dive, dive worse for oneself!
Ah, it's a nonsense.
He-e-elp!
Save!
Save!
Save!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Why are you screaming!
Sa-ve...
He's dro-wned.
Who?
Moomin-troll.
A brother.
We know your brother.
There he is.
Hey, Sniff, look what I've found!
What's the matter with you?
So, what have you found there?
Here!
Isn't it yours, is it?
No, it isn't mine.
This is a golden bangle of one little girl, who's name Snork.
Hm-m-m...
She closely resembles you, hm...
She's probably lost it, that Snork of yours.
Bungler!
Bungler-Snork!
And what's your name?
I am Snufkin.
Snuf-who?
Snufkin
Sniff and Moomin tin-tin-tin, And without-tail Snufkin!
Oh, you are not offended, are you?
What a lot of things!
What is it for?
For the disguise.
Why, are you hiding?
Whom from?
It doesn't matter.
Have you anything more?
I have.
I have everything I see, everything I'm thinking about.
The whole world!
Might...
I... take a little bit?
Take as much as you want!
He-e-e-elp!
Hush.
It seems to me...
I'm just on my way.
Await me here.
Why you, disgusting bush!
So, like this!
Oh, what a courageous you are!
Ah, it's a nonsense.
It is beautiful here.
I wanted something...
Oh, I wanted something...
I forgot.
Yes, you...
Haven't you lost the bangle?
Ah!
So pleasantly!
Thank you!
Then I know what is your name!
Your name is...
Bungler...
Oh!
bungler...
Oh!
I forgot what further..
Call me just...
Snork!
Here, this is Snork.
Moomin is a real hero!
He's saved me from a terrible bush!
In that cave over there.
And why did you get into the cave?
Fool!
The sparks are the little spirits of the fire.
I have quarreled recently with Groke about them.
With Groke!
Ah-h-h-h!
Why, yes!
With Groke.
She had frozen them in the volcano, but I freed them!
Since then Groke are looking for me everywhere.
Yes, and we have the public holiday today!
I'm inviting you, will you allow?
There's will not be public holiday!
We haven't found a place.
But I've found.
This is the cave.
It is very beautiful there!
Well, it's time for me to go...
Why, are you going away?
Yes.
I get used to being alone.
This way the thinking is better.
So clever, and so lonely!
...
Good bye!
But the things!
You've forgotten the things!
Sniff, go ask guests over.
And Moomin and I will put in order our cave.
You know, Snork, I perhaps on public holiday will change Snufkin's clothes.
There'll be a masked ball.
Wait for me.
I will be back soon.
Guests!
Guests!
Do make acquaintance.
This is Thingumy and Bob.
Whether they are foreigners or they are going to a nursery school.
Well, little ones!
Tell something!
Howdsly!
Howdsly!
Howdy!
Do you happen to have a pan of kissel, don't you?
Happy public holiday, young ladies!
Where is the public holiday!
Here's the public holiday.
And here's pasties with apples.
Here Moomintroll asked to pass on flowers to some girl.
Groke!
Dreadfsul!
And terriblsel one!
Here we have met, Snufkin!
Hey, let Moomintroll out, you bag!
Yuk!
I mistook!
- Well what?
- Well how?
- How are you feeling yourself?
- Poor Moomin!
Nothing special.
It seems to me that's here a little cold.
Hey, creatures, chew the buns!
- It'sla allsla!
- Allsla!
Snork, you're just treasure!
Oh!
There's!
There's!
That's!
A white!
When a winter is begining, all inhabitants of the blue valley are settling down into hibernation.
They will be sleep until a very spring!
And they will see so many marvelous dreams, that if tell it in succession a whole year will be not enough.

Did you knock 'em dead, Corky?
I did everything right.
You mean it went perfect?
You're first time on your own.
Me not there to see.
Don't make it more than it was.
Now don't give me that inferiority crap.
Now, did the lift go okay?
I never did it better.
Open.
Now, when you're rich and famous, don't you forget me.
I'll never forget you.
Open...
There are not three guys alive that can do what you can with those cards.
I'm tellin' ya, kid, you're as good as the game.
Sure, sure, sure.
Another Houdini.
Where you scared?
I sure was when I started.
Well, I wasn't calm.
But then,
I wasn't all that worried.
I figured I'd uh... done all the practicing I could so what the hell.
Were you the only magician?
Yes, sir.
The men all wanted to be Bob Dylan and the girls did mostly Barbara Walters imitations or sang Dolly Parton songs.
Some of them panicked before they got up to perform.
Not you though?
No, not me.
See, the guy who was in charge of everything ran things so well.
He had one of those hourglass egg timers and when he turned it over you started, and when the sand was finished so were you.
Good evening.
(audience talking and laughing)
Tell me, kid, did you begin with some flourishes?
Yeah.
You always taught me that they were the best attention grabbers.
Was I, was I right?
It was amazing.
Everybody quick shut up and watched.
No more whispering.
Nothing.
And once you had 'em Corky, then what did you do?
Well, I quick told this pudgy lady at the ringside to please pick any card she wanted as long as it was the big casino, the ten of diamonds.
Okay, would you please show the card to the audience?
And I forced it on her perfectly.
Everybody loved it a lot and laughed.
And then I went straight into rising aces.
Did the lift work great?
Yes, sir.
The sand was really running out of that hourglass.
And I told myself to forget it and just concentrate on the moves.
So, I took my time and made it work and everybody applauded like crazy.
(audience talking and laughing)
So I just took a couple of bows and I got off.
Oh, kid, don't bullshit me.
I really did do everything right.
Really.
Only nobody much cared.
And?
And?
Go on.
I guess I just cracked.
"You stupid sons of bitches," I said,
"Don't you know how hard that was?"
"That's a thousand hours of my life you just saw."
They don't care from heart, kid.
They just want to be entertained.
I guess I didn't do you proud all in all.
But did you talk to the people?
Did you use your charm?
I can't, and you know that.
Corky, you want to be as good as the game?
Don't you?
You know I do.
Then you better find yourself some charm, kid.
How?
You'll think of something.
(crowd clamoring)
Hey man, why don't you--
Hi, I'm George Todson, NBC.
I'm to meet Mr. Ben Greene.
Oh, yes sir.
He's right inside.
Thank you.
Say my man, how come he jumps ahead of us?
I guess this boy Withers is your latest sensation, hmm?
How are ya, sit down.
Jesus, you booked him into a very classy spot, Ben.
And I found him here.
You know, it's not easy getting him to move.
You want a beer?
It's safe.
Sure.
He likes this place?
Well, he bombed here his first time out, you know?
But he didn't get-- Hey, get him a beer, garcon.
Sure, Budweiser?
But he didn't give up.
He just worked his ass off for a year.
He come back and he hit it big.
There's never been a magician like him.
You dragged me down here for a magician?
Come on, Ben.
I run a goddamn network.
We can't book those guys on kiddy shows anymore.
Now listen, your old man got his start working for me you little fart.
Don't tell me what bombs.
Magic is misdirection.
That's all it is.
And misdirection is getting the people to look in the wrong place at the right times.
So?
So naturally, magic has had a little trouble on the tube.
Why?
Because you can't misdirect the goddamn camera.
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome for Mr. Corky Withers.
(audience applauds)
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ordinary deck of cards.
Loaded with stage presence.
I can't decide, does he remind me more of Errol Flynn or Valentino?
Thank you.
Young lady, would you please pick any card you want?
As long as it's the big casino, ten of diamonds?
Will you show the audience please?
Dynamite opening, Ben.
Does he actually get better?
That's hard to believe.
Well he got a little nervous on account he knows we're here.
My teacher was a great man.
His name was Merlin, and uh...
No, seriously his name was Merlin, Jr., and this is his version of the rising aces.
And here were are, here are the four aces.
One, two, three, four.
I'm going to place them back on top of the deck.
And would you please pick any card?
Just pick any card.
Good.
Look at the card, remember it, and cover the aces.
Thank you.
All right uh...
I'm sorry, I did that wrong.
You're not supposed to cover the aces in this trick.
Um, I'm sorry.
One sec.
He's gonna pull a five card left.
Watch him, just watch him, will ya?
Goddamn drunks.
He's not liftin' just the top card.
He's gonna grab five.
Sir, if you think you can do better, you're welcome to try.
Just gimme a hand getting up there, schmucko.
And step aside.
Okay, you're on.
Okay.
What's going on?
Thank you.
You really think you're that good do you?
I'll guaran-fuckin'-tee ya I am.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ohh!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ahh...
You ruined the rising aces.
So what, screw it.
You see the broad with the big jugs?
You mean the ah, young lady in the feathers?
Yeah, I see her so what?
Wonder if she'd like a roll in the shavings with me?
I don't think you're very funny.
Well they do.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A nice gimmick, the dummy.
What's his name?
Fats.
Don't encourage him.
I will now change a diamond into a heart.
I guess the reason I'm such a great lover is um--
I don't want to hear about your sex life if you don't mind.
Tell us all about yours then.
Everybody likes short stories.
Shh, Don't encourage him.
Please, ladies and gentlemen.
That's really a clever shtick.
Thank you.
All right, pick a diamond.
Huh?
I said pick a diamond.
All right.
It can change into a heart while I'm holding it.
Well, go on, show the audience.
If you're so great, change it while I'm holding it.
You won't give it back to me?
Well, that's another trick you've ruined.
Let's see,
I'll just have to think of something else.
You mean you're not gonna change my diamond into a...
Jesus Christ.
What?
It turned into a heart while I was holding it.
How'd he do that?
How'd he do that?
How did he do it?
How many times do I have to tell you.
Do you want to get out of here alive?
The kids good, I'll give him that.
Sure he's good.
I got me maybe the best magician in 50 years.
Team'd with the first x-rated dummy on the block.
Eat your heart out.
You say he really bombed here first time?
Yes.
Of course he didn't have the dummy with him then.
The dummy helps.
No question.
Right.
Local talent?
No.
He was brought up near Grossinger's in the Catskills.
I think his old man was a limey.
Came here to work in a health club and gave massages.
Somethin' like that.
(knock on the door) It's me.
Shit, It's old Gangrene.
Gangrene.
(laughing)
That's funny.
Quick intro.
Corky, our visitor from New York, George Todson.
How do you do, sir?
You have a lot of potential.
Hey, what about me?
You're terrific too, Fats.
Thanks, Mr. Wigston,
I mean Tubeston.
- Todson.
- Todson.
(laughing)
Now that's what I call funny.
Hey, you'll strain your pacemaker.
Behave yourself.
Come here a second, will ya?
Ah, by the way, how did you change the diamond to the heart?
I'm the misdirection dummy.
While we're bullshitting', you could bring an elephant on to the stage.
Which is why this magician will not bomb on the tube.
Why?
Because the goddamn camera watches their faces and not Corky's hands.
So you live and you learn.
- See ya.
- Bye.
Yeah, all right.
How'd it go?
Sen-fuckin'-sational.
See I'm catchin'.
What happens next?
Well, we reel 'em in slow.
The same kind of low key build up we gave Steve Martin last year.
I'm not lettin' you near New York, till we're close to making a deal.
So I just stay here?
No, first, I'd like to book you in a small lounge in Vegas for the experience.
Then the area talk shows.
You know, Tom Snyder, Mike Douglas.
All leading to Carson.
And if he asks you to come back,
I think he will, that should do it.
So, you keep motor mouth here in line, while I work on them droolers at the network.
It should take five, maybe six months.
Now, when I buy you a free lunch at the Four Seasons in New York, you'll know you're home free.
Sound okay?
Yes, sir.
You're a good kid, Corky.
Hey, you know what I think?
No, what do you think?
We're gonna be a star.
(city noise)
Zachary!
Seems like I'm breaking the law.
I'll see that no one touches it, sir.
No one must ever touch a Rolls, but a Rolls man.
Yes, sir.
Margo, will you show this gentleman to Mr. Greene's table please?
Hi.
Hi.
Is everything all right?
They want me?
The uh, network people I mean.
May I?
Yeah, thank you.
Have a cigar for later, Corky.
Take two, they're are big.
I invented conspicuous consumption.
Don't you forget that.
If you're trying to get my attention you got it.
Will you do me a favor kid?
Will you try not to turn shit heel?
It's almost an automatic once a guy makes it big.
I'd love to see you beat the odds.
Maybe I won't make it big.
Come on, tell me.
What is it?
Two years ago, you couldn't get arrested.
Two years from now you are going to have it all.
Corky, NBC wants a pilot special.
What's that?
What's that, it's what they gave Rich Little a while back.
Menu, sir?
Ah, you see, when they're hot for somebody like they're hot for you, they make a contract which hinges on the first show.
And if it hits, you're off and running for a bunch more.
Terrific.
That's why they call me the Postman,
I always deliver.
Is it set and, everything?
It's set but it's not set, set.
There's agent stuff like who pays how much for publicity, how much for the guest stars.
You'll have to take a medical exam and stuff like that.
Now what's wrong?
Um...
I don't think I'm going to take the medical exam.
Any particular reason?
Principle.
What the hell does that mean, principle?
Do you remember that first night when you came backstage at the uh, Stardust and you said, you wouldn't mind representing me?
Do you remember what I said?
You're goddamn right.
You said that I could represent you but you didn't want to sign.
That was principle too.
Because if we're happy with each other, our word should be enough.
To hell with signing some piece of paper.
Why is this with the medical exam principle?
Because they're saying something wrong with me.
And I say I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I don't need any doctors poking around inside me, that's all.
Are you serious about this?
I mean, is this a deal breaker?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Sadie, Sadie.
I have to put you on hold.
Sadie, what's the first rule for being an agent?
Never forget an act that killed Lincoln.
Head of the class.
Get me Bernstein in Legal.
Corky has turned impossible.
I don't believe it.
Well, I should have been a cesspool cleaner like my mama wanted.
Corky's so cheap, last night he sent his girlfriend out to hustle.
It's not true, not true.
Just ignore him.
When she came back this morning, he asked how much she'd gotten and she said
"Sixteen dollars and ten cents."
Corky said "Ten cents?
My God, who gave you ten cents?"
And she said "Everybody."
Dammit.
Everybody, she said,
Body, body, body.
Dody, dudy, duny.
And she said-- And she said--
And she said everybody.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
I've been having meetings for hours.
I couldn't budge 'em, Cork.
I thought you said they wanted me?
Well they do Cork, but--
Didn't you explain about the principle?
Now kid, this is network policy.
It's legal policy.
Now I'm sitting here with three of our genius lawyers, my God, their IQ's alone must total up to 100.
Now we have called NBC a dozen times and they are not,
I repeat not about to spend a half a million bucks only to find out on taping day that there's some kinda health problem.
There's no problem!
Corky!
Make 'em understand.
(hangs up phone)
Well...
Shoo, will you, fellas.
Let me handle this alone.
Yep, right.
Good luck, Ben.
(phone ringing)
Yeah.
Now kid, I don't have to ask you what the trouble is.
'Cause I know what the trouble is.
I've told you once before.
It's just success, kid.
Please believe me.
You want success but you're afraid of it.
Now that happens to everybody at this stage.
I'm not afraid.
Now you stay right there.
and I'll be right over and we'll talk it through.
I'm not afraid.
Hang tight, kid.
I'm on my way.
I won't be here!
(ominous music)
We should hit Grossinger's inside another 20 minutes.
Never mind that.
Take your next left.
Here.
Keep going into town.
Your place?
I was brought up here.
Must remember it being a whole lot bigger, huh?
No.
Want to look around?
No point.
Family all gone, huh?
Yeah.
Ah, you're lucky.
I live with four brothers, all assholes.
I don't want to come on like some ghoul, but...
Do you got people in there?
People?
Just family.
You look a lot like yourself, you know that?
Yeah, I caught you on the Carson Show a couple times.
You must make a ton for that, huh?
How'd you luck into that?
You know, see, I sing great.
I know they'd cream over me.
My agent, William Morris, arranged it.
Is this Morris guy a personal friend of Carson's?
Is that how that works?
William Morris is the name of a agency, not a guy.
Oh.
Hold it, right here.
Pull over to your left.
Fine.
Hey, this is Lake Melody, ain't it?
I'll be right back.
(door bell)
Anybody?
Anybody home?
What do you want?
A cabin.
We're kinda closed.
Something above the lake is what I'm after.
It's just the kind of place I'm looking for.
I won't be disturbed here.
That's for sure.
But like I said, we're kinda closed.
$50 bucks a night.
In advance.
We just re-opened.
If you don't want me waitin'?
How you gonna get to Grossinger's?
I'll call a local cab when I need one.
How much?
$80 bucks, not countin' tip.
Okay.
Ah...
Here's a hundred for the driving, and another hundred, for a favor.
Name it.
You didn't bring me here, okay?
Okay.
Good.
Thanks.
What you see is what you get.
The um, the bedroom's back there and the kitchenette and the bathroom across.
Fine.
Here's your key.
Help!
Help!
Calling all schmucko's.
Save me.
Hi.
Hi.
Jesus Christ.
This is Grossinger's?
I wonder if her ass is on ball bearings.
Shut up.
Oh, sounds like I stepped on a corn.
Sorry.
No, it's just that I carried her picture all these years.
And she didn't remember me.
Awe.
He didn't remember me.
Hello?
Sorry to bother you.
Oh, that's all right.
No soap.
I didn't think you'd like it.
You leaving now?
No, I didn't mean no soap that way.
I meant there wasn't any soap, or towels either.
Oh, come on in here and grab one.
Oh, oh my God, you brought Fats.
You thought Peg didn't remember.
Awe.
You knew who I was too?
Yeah.
Well, why didn't you two at least grunt at each other?
He's just as cute as he is on the tube?
Cute?
Virile, yes.
Sexy, yes.
Ronald Reagan is cute.
Oh please, could I hold him, I'll be careful.
Oh, he's heavy.
Husky you bimbo.
His lips didn't move.
That's because you're not stroking my levers sweetheart.
Right in there.
Oh, she goosed me.
Ignore him, go right ahead.
Okay.
There.
And there.
I see.
(moaning)
I love it.
Hey, she hugged me to her bosom.
I suspect she found me irresistible.
Don't we all?
She asked you over for dinner, huh?
How long are you going to stay?
I don't know, why?
If you stayed late, that might mean you was getting hugged to her bosom too which just might make old Fats jealous and we wouldn't want that, would we now?
Hmm?
You never really told, why you were here.
Hiding.
Gotta get my head on straight.
My agent, he looks like the Ancient Mariner in that poem we hated in high school.
He's negotiating for a shot for me to maybe make it big.
We argued.
But I thought it was just principle.
The truth is probably I'm scared of success.
That's all.
You always were this weirdly timid person, Cork.
That's for sure.
Your folks still run this place?
No, they took a motel in Florida.
Gave this place to me.
But I just couldn't make a go of it.
Too bad.
The Catskills are dying and that's the truth.
Me and Duke are lookin' to sell.
God, you're beautiful.
Don't I wish.
I had such a crush on you.
No one ever accused you of having good taste, Cork.
When I moved away I whittled you a present, a wooden heart.
You never gave it to me though.
I lost it before I got it finished.
I knew you had a crush on me.
I was always pretty for you.
I didn't say pretty.
You didn't pick up on my Duke mention either.
After all, he is my consort.
My spouse.
I'm very big on enlarging my vocabulary.
Are you very big on Duke?
We seem to separate what seems like, every full moon, it hasn't been your everyday Walt Disney type marriage.
Where is he?
Quick business trip.
I'm sorry.
Tell me, does he... does he still look like James Dean?
Hey.
Hey.
Hearty burgundy.
Very medicinal.
Peg?
Admit it, now I'm beautiful.
How was the orgy?
Did you score?
The high point of the evening was when I reduced her to tears.
That-a-boy, schmucko.
Hey, when are we movin' on?
Tomorrow.
The day after.
Soon.
Peggy Ann Snow, Peggy Ann Snow, please let me follow, where ever you go.
Why'd you close the door?
I'm contemplating taking a piss, do you mind?
Ooh, fancy-yancy.
Hey stick your head out here one sec.
Was you thinkin' about her?
...Stuff like that.
So how long did you work with this Merlin guy?
Ah, I worked for him...years.
But uh, he taught me everything.
But I never performed.
Never like...never on my own.
Why not?
Probably afraid I'd fail.
Dope.
It wasn't 'til the week he took really sick.
And uh, he begged me that I got the guts to try.
Did you bring any tricks up with you?
No.
I don't do tricks.
Tricks means something set up beforehand.
A box with a fake lid.
A stacked deck of cards.
I don't do that.
Will you just use whatever's available?
Yeah.
Ah.
Here.
Amaze me.
A stone?
Oh, come on, will ya.
Well that was available.
- Oh, do it again.
Do it again.
- Do what again?
Oh, come on.
Okay.
You bastard.
You bastard.
I really love magic.
No magic, it's just skill.
All explainable.
I don't think I want to believe that.
Can you explain everything?
Pretty much.
What can't you explain?
Look, I don't want to get into this.
Magic's just to entertain.
You're not supposed to take it seriously.
What can't you explain?
Merlin, his wife was his assistant before me.
They were close.
They really cared.
Those last days in the hospital with her he claimed he could read her mind.
You believe that don't you?
I don't know.
I want to, I guess.
See in their act, they used to do a lot of phony telepathy crap.
Mostly cards.
Then at the end they both wanted to do it for real.
To prove to each other how much they cared, is how he put it.
Do you know the exact procedures they did and everything?
Sure.
Look, I don't want to get into this.
Oh, it'll be fun.
Come on.
I'd fail.
So what.
I don't want you thinkin' bad of me let's say.
Okay.
Forget the whole thing.
I'm trying to get away from pressure, please.
So who's putting you under pressure?
Not me.
Just thought it might be a kick.
But it's forgotten.
Now we've each shuffled a deck, okay?
Now you take mine.
So... just spread your cards like this.
Fine.
Okay.
Now take one card, any card.
Look at it.
And remember it.
Now what?
Now come on, you must really look at it.
I'm looking, I'm looking, don't be mad.
Okay.
Just concentrate on that one card.
Now, gather your cards up.
Place the card back face down.
Good.
Just cut the cards once.
Just take my deck.
Look for your card.
When you find it, take it out.
Tell me when you've found it.
Okay.
Okay?
What happens now?
What happened with Merlin was uh, she put the card next to her heart.
And uh, he went through her deck kind of like this.
Ah...
What's my card?
I don't know.
You must really think hard.
Okay.
Okay, I'm thinking really hard.
Well?
I'm sorry.
Well, don't stop.
I'm concentrating my ass off.
Okay.
My God it's red isn't it?
It's red.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
I give away nothing.
Come on concentrate, just concentrate.
Hey.
Show me.
We came close, what the hell.
Sit down, Peg!
Get back down!
That was your fault.
You started out fine, but then you let me drift.
Jesus Cork, forget it.
I was in bad shape in New York, Peg, and I had to run.
Where do you go when there's no place to go?
You go home.
Except there was nothing but empty houses and old cemeteries.
And I figured I'd stop by here and ask your folks about you.
Where were you living, what city, how many kids?
Never expected to find you here.
I've loved you all my goddamn life.
I needed a piece of good news about Peggy Ann Snow.
Shuffle the goddamn cards, fast!
We're gonna do it right this time.
I just know we will, because we both want it a lot.
Give me your deck.
Take my deck.
Spread the cards.
Take your card.
Pick it out.
Look at it.
Put it back on top.
Now, cut the deck once.
Take my deck, look for your card.
When you find it, tell me.
Look at me.
Should I think now?
Yes, very hard.
I am.
You're not, I can tell by your eyes your not.
Well, I'm frightened is why.
Nothing to be afraid of.
If it goes bad.
It won't go bad, not if two people want something as much as this.
There must be nothing in your mind but your card.
Nothing in your mind but--
What?
My card.
Concentrate.
(clock ticking)
Just think, think hard.
Is it--
Please is it--
Is it the three of clubs?
The three of clubs?
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I'll bet they don't give service like that at Grossinger's.
Drop in again in 15 years.
Why the jokes?
I'm kind of feeling my way along.
I never fooled around before.
True.
I guess sex wasn't that big a deal in my life.
What about Duke?
Mainly, he blew in my ear a lot.
True.
I deceived him into thinking it drives me mad.
He tongues away at me and I moan a lot but-- secretly I'm making a grocery lists.
(laughing)
Oh, I can be a very crappy lady when I put my mind to it.
Come here.
Let's you and me take off.
Just us.
You don't care for Duke and you know it.
I dump Duke, and you'd leave Fats, that's your offer?
Yeah, just say the word and we'll go.
A man appears after 15 years.
Says run away with me.
A girl ought to at least be able to take a bubble bath.
Think about it, right?
Why in the hell were you so shy all those years ago, huh?
Hey, what do you say sports fans.
Nah.
What's the matter?
Getting your period?
Feeling kinda blue.
I miss the city bad.
Oh, the country grows on you.
So does fungus.
I told you once already we'd leave.
When?
When I want to, now drop it.
What's so great here?
Tell me that.
Simmer down, okay?
Okay.
Hey, how's this for a solution?
You stay around here and turn hayseed and I'll head back to Manhattan.
I take it the silence means no?
Discussion's over.
That's all.
I want out of here!
Simmer the hell down!
- Just because--
- Watch it mister!
- Just because some--
- You've been warned!
Just because some sagging bitch of an ingenue drops her pants for you!
Shut up!
Corky, you do it so good.
You're even better than the garbage men.
(screams)
Hey Ben, how do you like it?
I think it's going to be terrific.
What's with Gangrene?
Blue Cross repossess your tongue?
Come on in, shut up.
Come on in Ben, I'll do the whole routine for you?
How the hell did you ever find me.
You're amazing.
I'll bet it was that kid cab driver.
He must've called the office and found ya.
Is that right, that's it?
Yeah, I told him I was with William Morris.
He looked like a hustler, so I gave him a hundred to shut him up.
How much did you give him to talk.
Doesn't matter.
Right, right, right, right, right.
Right, you're here, that's the main thing.
That's it, right.
Come on, grab yourself a seat.
And uh, watch.
Just remember that I haven't got this anywhere near performance level yet.
How long ya been like this kid?
Like what?
Oh my God, you don't think that was for real?
How'd you think I rehearse?
It's no good.
It's for the act for Christ sakes!
Watch now.
Ladies and Gentlemen, for your viewing pleasure.
My version of the Miser's Dream.
Was it a wet dream?
Shut up.
Imagine if you will.
When I have a wet dream all that happens is I wake up covered with sawdust.
If you don't stop interrupting
I'm going to put a contract out on you with a mafia woodpecker.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a woodpecker.
Will you be quiet?
Don't encourage him, ladies and gentlemen.
It's really a great beginning, isn't it, Ben.
Is this why you wouldn't take the medical exam?
You figured somebody'd find out?
Bullshit!
I'll take the stupid exam!
I was afraid of success like you said.
I needed to get my head on straight.
I'll take the exam, do the show, whatever you want.
What I want kid?
What I want is for you to see somebody.
Who?
Who would I see?
Quit with the games!
Quit with the yelling!
Shut up!
He should show a little grati-fuckin'-tude.
You been slaving' away, comin' up with the great new stuff.
That was blockbuster material, mister.
When I come back with Woody the Woodpecker, they'll plotz in Vegas.
That's funny.
Nothin's funny.
Not anymore.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna make a few phone calls.
Tell people you mean?
Corky, you ain't in control!
Ben, you owe me a listen don't you think?
Yeah, I was kind of out of control back in the city.
I uh...
I could feel myself starting to slip down the iceberg.
So you took off, and now you're fine?
Sure.
On account of Peg.
The local town pump, terrific knockers.
Look Fats, please.
Come on, will ya?
Sorry.
Um...
I've known her ever since high school.
I never figured I'd have a chance with her, but uh, now everything's changed.
She believes in me.
Listen, girls are for down the line, kid.
Right now, you gotta let me help you.
I know a lot of people.
Beautiful doctors.
He means headshrinkers.
He just thinks you're a fruit cake.
He doesn't, he never said that, he's on our side.
He's the villain.
Don't forget that.
Never forget that.
Hey, kid.
I'm gonna ask you to do something.
It's a little something anybody ought to be able to do.
Now if you can do it, fine.
We'll forget this whole thing.
But if you can't, we'll think about getting you to see somebody fast.
Is it a deal?
Name it.
Make Fats shut up for five minutes.
Five minutes.
I can make him shut up for five years.
Wonderful.
I feel like the village idiot, if you want to know the truth.
Can we talk or is it going to be strictly semaphore?
How long so far?
There's 30 seconds.
Gosh, that's uh...
Four and a half minutes to go.
Think I'll make it?
Don't happen to have another of those, do ya?
Thanks.
"Take two, they're big."
Remember when you said that, Ben?
A pro never forgets his good lines, kid.
How long now?
Coming up to a minute.
Do you think we'll laugh about this some day?
We might.
Make a terrific scene if you ever decide to write your autobiography.
Hey, I know what you should call it, um...
"Failing Upwards", or,
"How to Succeed in Show Business, by Outliving Everybody".
Two minutes yet?
A minute forty-five.
This is very cruel of you, you know that?
I don't mean it to be.
I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive you.
Well, that would be sad.
Time?
It's uh... two and a half minutes to go.
I can't make it.
Well, I didn't think you could.
Hello everybody.
This is Mrs. Norman Main.
My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you.
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.
Nothing to give but blood sweat and tears.
Nothing to lose but your change.
Here he is boys.
Here he is world.
Here's Fats.
You're not lettin' him outta here.
He's the villain, don't forget that.
Hey, I think you better sit down.
Hey kid,
I have lived through Tallulah Bankhead and the death of Vaudeville.
I don't scare easy.
But I need my chance.
Your only chance is to get help fast and that's what I'm going to see happens.
Don't, ever raise a hand to me again.
You're taking my one chance.
I'm your one chance.
He's right.
The Postman's right.
You're crazy.
I tried to stop him didn't I?
Tried, tried?
You failed.
God damn it.
Look at me.
You know it's the hatch for you.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I know that, and you know that.
But all those piss ant dolts who run the world, they hate us because we're special.
They'll put you somewhere dark and moody.
Don't talk that way, please.
Cut the migraine shit.
Don't you care about anything?
Christ, don't you care about the girl?
Peg?
I love Peg.
I hope she loves you too.
So on visiting day she can bring crayons and the two of you's can color together.
What do you want from me?
You know goddamn well what.
I don't!
Liar.
- Tell me!
- Weakling.
- I'm not, I'm not!
- Stop the Postman!
- I can't!
- Gutless fuck!
- I can't!
- Stop the Postman!
How, how with what?
Me, me, me, me, me!
(Fats screaming)
(Fats screaming)
(Fats screaming)
(Fats screaming)
(thud)
Cork?
What's up, what is it?
Oh, I meant to ask.
Do you want me unthaw the asparagus tips, or the French-cut green beans?
Either.
No fair.
You're the man you've got to make the decision.
Asparagus tips.
Hey what are you doing in the woods?
Walkin', thinkin'.
About me?
You changin' your mind about me?
Jesus no.
Better not you bastard.
(groaning)
Well, what is it?
My head, you broke it.
Well, what'll I do?
Can't think, help me.
I will don't worry.
I'll take care.
Ah.
You're hurtin' me.
Sorry.
There you are, that should do it.
That better?
I guess.
Good.
All right.
Does it show?
Well...
Well, I'll slip you into your overall outfit with a cap.
And uh, nobody will be able to tell a thing.
- Hey, Fats?
- Yeah.
- I've been doin' some thinking.
- Yeah.
What would you say if I uh... if I called the police and told?
You ain't being logical.
Look, Gangrene was taken care of because he was going to have you put away.
If you tell the cops, they'll have you put away.
Well, what'll we do with him?
Bring me any identification he's got on him.
Why?
Time for a little dip.
After dinner get yourself some stones and stuff 'em in his pockets.
But I'm not that strong a swimmer.
Just dog paddle out to the middle and drop him down.
I know this lake.
There's snapping turtles out there.
Everybody said that.
Once there was a water moccasin scare.
I don't care if the Loch Ness monster's out there, and he's ravenous.
Do it beautifully.
(screaming)
Hello?
Good morning.
Coffee's on.
Coffee's ready.
- Good.
- Careful.
Uh, Duke got home very late last night.
He didn't much like the idea of me being here alone with a man.
He's watching us now.
Uh, do you think it's wise for me to come up there now?
I think he wants to watch us together.
Oh.
Give me five minutes.
Hey.
Has he got a telescope?
Because if he doesn't,
I'd like to say that going to bed with you is maybe the best three things that ever happened to me.
And I'd love some coffee.
And I adore you.
And I take it with cream and sugar.
And your breasts belong in the Louvre, which is a museum in Paris that I plan on visiting with you once you get wise and decide to leave the old ear blower.
Are you ever somethin'.
Hello?
We're in the kitchen.
Hi Duke.
How are you?
Come on in, sit down.
Yeah, thanks.
Doing okay.
You take your coffee how?
Everything.
I'm sorry I wasn't here to greet you.
Help with the entertaining and all.
But somebody's got to earn a living.
You're still in real estate, right?
No, I gave that up.
It was dull.
What I really like is the out a doors.
Go fishing, hunting.
That probably seems dull to someone like you.
No, not at all.
Fine, thanks.
And I do a little selling' nowadays.
Sundries, like that.
I'm surprised Peg here didn't bring you up to date.
Well, she may have.
The truth is, once I start drinking wine, you can forget about me.
Hey Duke, that stuff you sell?
You don't happen to have a penis do you?
My last one caught Dutch Elm Disease and it's murder getting an erection.
(laughing)
God damn, that's clever.
Don't tell schmucko.
Tell me.
'Cause I'm the talent.
Shh.
(muffled scream)
Do you travel a lot in your work?
How do you do that?
I mean, that's terrific.
I'm really glad you're here for me to see this.
Are you going to be good?
I mean it.
You promise?
Okay.
Ask him if he's glad I'm here too?
Yeah, the both of you.
Thank you.
How long are you going to be?
Quick as I can.
As long as it takes me to board up those far cabins.
Don't stay out too long.
You'll get soaked.
How'd I do?
Just unbelievable.
Too bad Fats wasn't here.
He might of been a little help.
Gotten a couple of laughs.
You're always unbelievable.
Oh, brains as well as boobs.
Corky, do you drive a Rolls?
No.
Well there's somebody's white Rolls parked down there.
Shit.
It's gotta be Gangrene's.
Why would he leave it though.
Who's is it?
My agent.
He's rich as hell.
But still you just don't leave an $80,000 car and walk away.
He must have come looking for me.
Looking for you?
Yeah.
He's left the keys.
Yeah, look if I level with you, you won't let this get around?
I'm in hiding.
A lot of career problems.
I haven't been behaving all that normal.
Well, can you find out what's happened to him?
This cars been here a couple of hours.
Yeah, I'll sure as hell try.
Hey, would you mind getting it unstuck?
Me driving an $80,000 car,
I'd mind that a lot.
Sadie?
Sadie?
It's me.
Is he in?
Please.
(dial tone)
Don't yell at me Goddamn it.
I'm sick of hearing about my erratic behavior.
How the hell did you ever find me?
I tipped that bastard cabbie so he wouldn't tell.
We were on a long walk is why you didn't find anybody.
Never mind who the we is, finish about the car.
Ha, ha.
I'd love to have seen that.
You hitchhiking a ride to Grossinger's.
Why didn't you have 'em come and un-stick the car.
Quit yelling.
I should a known, nobody touches your Rolls but a Rolls man.
Sorry.
Duke's on his way.
Yes, sir.
That was the we.
Yes sir, a lot.
It's not ridiculous.
We grew up together.
Yes she's married.
But I think she's leaving him for me.
The marriage was over.
I'm not talking about puppy love, Ben.
I'm talking about salvation.
Some fish.
Some fish he takes me for.
Your old pal I'm talking about.
I suspected.
His story's so full a holes.
Why do you keep repeating that?
So a car is here, who care?
Besides, Corky agrees with you.
It's a crazy story, but there it is.
Some happy coincidence.
A guy drives 90 miles and you and Corky just happen to be off in the woods when he's snooping'.
You put out for him in the woods, did ya?
I love it when you're drinking.
Well, why didn't you tell me about this Goddamn legendary walk before?
No comment.
Listen,
I know his story's bullshit because I got the car out of the mud and it was nothing.
If I can do it, anybody can.
Maybe he tried.
Maybe he couldn't.
He's old.
Corky never said he was old.
He must of to me.
When?
When we were having dinner, probably.
He got squiffed fast and flaked out.
That's what he said earlier.
And how did you know he was old, did you see him?
Answer me, I'm talking to you!
No, I didn't see him.
Why not?
He must've wrung the bell.
I mean the guy drives 90 miles, he's gonna ring the goddamn doorbell, wouldn't you agree?
I didn't hear any bell.
Now quit this.
Why not?
What were you doin' that was so--
Did he ring while you were screwing', is that it?
That is it, isn't it?
No it isn't.
Why didn't you invite him in to watch?
Shut your dirty mouth.
Did you screw Corky?
No!
I'll pound you all day, you keep lying!
I'm not lying!
The truth, the goddamn truth!
Did you fuck him?
No I didn't!
But I wanted to.
Come on, it'll be fun.
If you don't like fishin' I'll let you row.
Just had a good talk with Peg.
Like to have one with you now.
I'll grab a jacket.
Where is Peg?
She's in town making a decision, she said.
Oh.
What are you doin' that for?
Uh, habit.
Hey, we trust each other don't we?
Of course.
You seem upset.
Should I be?
Get in the front.
What are you lookin' for?
Nothin'.
You're the one wants to fish.
Why don't you try over there.
Here I'll do the rowing.
I know the best holes.
When I get us there you can take over.
I'm not much on booze.
I told you that.
You told me a lot of things.
What's that supposed to mean?
Peg said you screwed her last night.
(laughing)
Damn.
I told her to keep it a secret.
You think it's funny, do you?
Is that why you brought me out here?
Try to get me to admit to something that never happened?
If it is I'd like to go back in now, Duke.
What she said was, she wanted to go to bed with you.
I'm loosin' her Corky, and I don't know what to do.
All she does is talk about you, Duke.
You're not losing anybody.
What I said before, about quitting the real estate business, there was never any real estate business to quit.
She came in when I was on top.
And she stuck with me all the way down.
Goddamn it.
Oh, that's heavy.
Duke, I said I'd like to go back in now.
This feels like a whale.
God, I'm cold, let's get the hell in.
It's comin' loose.
Hey, you're breakin' my pole.
I'm trying to help you, that's all.
Well, don't help.
It's comin' now.
It's comin'.
Goddamn log.
Any of that scotch left?
Thought you didn't like booze?
I'm freezing my nuts off, that's all.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I wonder who he is.
See what his wallet says.
Jesus Christ,
I was thinking' he might be your Rolls Royce guy.
Gangrene?
You must be kidding' me.
He's about 6'3".
Nothin'.
He's stripped clean.
It doesn't make sense.
Must be some identification.
Jesus Christ, he might still be alive.
Fantastic.
I'll do the kiss of life.
You run up to the house, call Normandy Hospital.
Tell 'em to get over.
Right.
And stay at the house 'til they get there so you can direct 'em straight here.
Gotcha.
(ominous music)
Ben Greene.
Gangrene.
Son-of-a-bitch.
He is the Rolls guy.
Oh.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Don't panic.
My God, what have you done!
I said don't panic.
My God, what am I going to do?
Well, pick me up dumb-dumb and I'll tell ya.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Well, sit down then, dummy.
Alright.
You're gonna zoom to my suitcase and whip out one of those nice long pieces of canvas.
Well clean my face and you won't throw up.
Okay.
You're gonna take the canvas and you're gonna wrap part around Duke here, and part of it around Gangrene.
Then you're gonna get a nice big rock and wrap the rest around it.
Take that out a my mouth.
Then you're gonna row out and dump the bundle over the side.
And if you do it right,
I'll be able to say atta-boy, schmucko.
Two birds with one stone.
Hi.
Hi.
You've had quite a day I guess.
Whatever.
Where's Duke.
We had a blow up.
He tried to get me to admit we'd gone to bed together.
But uh... when he couldn't he told me he was going to go hunting and I should get the hell out by the time he got back.
Are you coming with me?
Are you coming with me?
I gotta know.
Who wins, me or Duke?
If I'm a prize, then you're the winner.
And as soon as Duke gets back and I can tell him in person that I'm leaving, we can take off.
Gee you know I...
I...
I don't think you should put yourself through a big emotional scene like that, do you?
Well, I gotta leave Duke with his pride.
We spent a lotta years together and ah... he's gotta understand that he didn't fail.
We failed together.
So let's the both of us pack, okay.
Don't try arguing me out of this.
He's got to be home soon.
He can't hunt at night time, right?
Okay.
Oh, my God.
She's leaving Duke for you.
Fan-fucking-gradly, fan-fucking-tastic.
Thank you sports fans.
Well, where are we off to?
Now don't get emotional about this.
About what, about what?
I think maybe there's just going to be two of us on the honeymoon.
What's the punch line?
You're gonna leave me behind?
Come on buddy, quit the kiddin'.
My head's on straight on now.
I want to get to know her, that's all.
Take her places.
Show her things.
Paris, maybe, like that.
The Eiffel Tower.
The Louvre.
You know?
Schmucko, you've never been to Paris.
What's this "show her" routine?
I'll be good.
You'll see.
I wanna see Paris too.
You want me to come crawling?
You want me to beg?
Okay, this is me, Fats, and I'm beggin'.
It's not easy for me either.
It is.
It is easy.
You won't be alone.
I'll tell.
What will you tell?
Everything.
I will.
I swear.
In the middle of the act, one night, when you don't expect it.
I'll scream, there's bodies in Lake Melody.
I don't see that happening.
I'm doing a single now.
(stairs creaking)
Duke?
Duke?
How'd it go?
Duke understand?
We haven't talked yet.
You mean he isn't back yet?
Christ, Peg.
Got kinda scary up there.
And I wanted a drink, but I didn't much wanna drink alone.
Well, let's just go.
Let's get the hell out.
Send him a telegram.
I'm sorry, my mind's made up.
Besides, he can't be much longer.
You don't know that.
He was drinking heavy when he left here.
Did he take a flashlight with him?
Did you notice?
All I noticed was that big goddamn elephant gun he was carrying when he hinted I vacate the premises.
Come on, it's stupid waiting around.
Then I'm stupid.
I didn't say you were stupid.
I said waiting was.
I'm aware of your opinion on the subject.
Well, try agreeing with me for once.
Instead of being stubborn.
Give it a rest, Cork.
(singing) Ah...
Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you.
Fasten your seat belts everybody.
It's going to be a bumpy night.
I'm here to save you two from yourselves.
Want me to do something dazzling?
You do magic too?
Corky does magic.
I only do tricks.
Hey, I got just the thing, Peg.
Bring me a couple a decks of cards and I'll read your mind.
What do you mean?
I'll pull the same card from your deck that you pulled from mine.
That's not a trick.
You can't do that.
Sure.
You just peek at the bottom card after shuffling and it's easy as apple pie.
Corky makes a big deal production number out of it sometimes.
Like when he's got some bimbo stewardess he wants to screw.
He makes him think their minds have touched.
Never fails.
You'll never know how many people want to believe in magic.
Oh shit.
Peg.
Peg, please.
- Please, please come--
- Leave me alone.
Were you laughing every second.
Please, please.
Was I funny you bastard son-of-a-bitch?
Oh!
Let me explain.
Hey, hey.
Jesus.
Listen to me you schmuck.
You gotta please just answer me one small question?
Why'd you think I blew the whistle?
Ah, because I was leaving.
Because you were jealous.
Wrong, schmucko.
I did it because I could.
See?
Why didn't you stop me?
Answer, you didn't because you couldn't.
Look at him.
He still doesn't understand.
Better sit down kid while I hit you with an explanation.
Ever since we got together, I laid low.
It was best for the act.
I let you share the limelight.
If there's one thing about me, I'm big.
But then earlier today, when I begged ya, pleaded not to be left behind and you pissed ice water all over me, well, that tore it.
If I'm boring you, please walk around.
I don't care.
Fats, don't start in on me.
Please don't.
Listen, I took a failure.
With the charm of Tricky Dickey Nixon.
I made us skyrocket.
It's not gonna be you and her, it's gonna stay you and me.
Except from now on even that's changed.
It's me and you.
You said I've got a weak stomach.
- You look tired.
- I'm not.
- Then what are you yawning for?
- I'm not yawning.
You gotta wake you up.
- Crawl around.
That should help.
- You think?
Hey yeah, it does help.
Say thank you, Fats.
Thanks.
Thanks, Fats.
With feeling, like I'm doing.
I'm filled with grati-fucking-tude.
Gee, you've got talent after all.
Let's see what else you can do.
Fats says smile.
Fats says frown.
Fats says touch the ceiling.
Fats says spin around.
Fats says get a knife.
What?
Get a knife.
Come on.
From my suitcase.
Yeah.
I know where it is.
I wonder what we could do with it?
Hey, I could whittle something.
I'm good at that, and fast too, name it.
No.
I'm looking for something with a little more pizzazz.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't do it.
You really love old Peg, don't ya?
Oh please, don't kill her.
Schmucko, easy.
I wouldn't dream of depriving you of that pleasure.
No, I can't do it!
There's that old bug-a-boo of yours again.
lack of confidence.
I won't and you can't make me!
Wow, I really stepped on a corn that time.
If I can't make ya, I can't make ya.
- How's your head, Cork?
- Fine!
Thought you might be getting' a migraine.
No!
Shows how wrong you can be.
(screaming)
Open those baby blues.
Looks to me like one of those gut wrenchers.
It's getting bad fast.
Please!
Drilling right into the brain, is it?
(moaning in pain)
Surprise.
Came fast.
It can go fast.
Yeah?
Oh yes.
Not so deep anymore?
No, not so deep.
It'll all be gone soon.
Uh...thanks, Fats.
Want it a hundred times worse, and a hundred days long?
No.
Then take the knife on up the hill, lover.
And kiss the girl goodbye.
(door rattling)
Duke?
I left schmucko down at the cabin.
Open up, huh?
You and me gotta have a quick palaver.
Corky, there's nothin' to say.
I told ya, he's at the cabin.
You and me are the only ones who can straighten this out.
Go away, Cork.
Fats.
All right, go away, Fats.
That's better.
At least we know who we are now.
Hey, I've got a present that'll make you smile.
Promise it will.
He made it for you, Peg.
For you to remember him by.
See, he's leaving now and he wants you to have this.
Have what?
A wooden heart.
He whittled it for you before he sent me up.
He's quick with his hands.
Leave it outside the door.
Take his heart, Peg.
So he'll know you don't feel contempt for him.
Oh, I never felt that.
At least that's something.
I'll leave it by the door.
Bye.
Wait a minute, you didn't leave.
Brains as well as boobs.
Anytime you feel like playing with my levers you'll call?
Sure, sure.
Peggy Ann Snow,
Peggy Ann Snow, please let me follow wherever you go...
(ominous music)
She liked my heart.
She smiled when she picked it up.
She looked so pleased and everything.
I made her happy.
Me.
No tricks or anything.
What's wrong?
I don't know how to say this, since I haven't got a stomach, but my stomach hurts.
Bad?
Gettin' bad.
Gettin' real bad.
Yeah.
What's goin' on?
We're dying I think is what it is?
Dyin'?
Yeah,
I put the knife deep in me.
Christ, it's spreadin'.
Yeah.
Don't leave me here alone.
Don't worry.
Can you get over here.
All right, I'll try.
Put me flat.
Here.
Why didn't you leave?
Go with her when you had the chance?
She'd never of gone with me.
She'd have turned me down.
I couldn't even get her to open the door by myself.
It was never me.
Always us.
Schmucko, us was you.
What?
It was you all the time.
I hope I don't die first, is all.
I think we'll go together.
Chances are.
Hey Cork?
Hey, it's me.
I...
I changed my mind.
Let's give it a whack okay?
See how it goes?
What do ya say?
I'm warning you Cork, don't play hard to get with me.
'Cause I'm a woman see, and I can always change my mind again.
You may not get this oppor-fuckin'-tunity tomorrow.
I did everything right.
You mean it went perfect?
You're first time on your own.
Me not there to see.
Don't make it more than it was.
Now don't give me that inferiority crap.
Now, did the lift go okay?
I never did it better.
Open.
Now, when you're rich and famous, don't you forget me.
I'll never forget you.
Open.
There are not three guys alive that can do what you can with those cards.
I'm tellin' ya kid, you're as good as the game.
Sure, sure, sure.
Another Houdini.
Where you scared?
I sure was when I started.
Well I wasn't calm.
But then,
I wasn't all that worried.
I figured I'd uh... done all the practicing I could so what the hell.
Were you the only magician?
Yes sir.
The men all wanted to be Bob Dylan and the girls did mostly Barbara Walters imitations or sang Dolly Parton songs.
Some of them panicked before they got up to perform.
Not you though?
No, not me.
See, the guy who was in charge of everything ran things so well.
He had one of those hourglass egg timers and when he turned it over you started, and when the sand was finished so were you.
Good evening.
Tell me kid, did you begin with some flourishes?
Yeah.
You always taught me that they were the best attention grabbers.
Was I, was I right?
It was amazing.
Everybody quick shut up and watched.
No more whispering.
Nothing.
And once you had 'em Corky, then what did you do?
Well I quick told this pudgy lady at the ringside to please pick any card she wanted as long as it was the big casino, the ten of diamonds.
Okay, would you please show the card to the audience?
And I forced it on her perfectly.
Everybody loved it a lot and laughed.
And then I went straight into rising aces.
Did the lift work great?
Yes sir.
The sand was really running out of that hourglass.
And I told myself to forget it and just concentrate on the moves.
So I took my time and made it work and everybody applauded like crazy.
So I just took a couple of bows and I got off.
Oh kid.
Don't bullshit me.
I really did do everything right.
Really.
Only nobody much cared.
And?
And?
Go on.
I guess I just cracked.
"You stupid sons of bitches, "I said,"
"Don't you know how hard that was?"
"That's a thousand hours of my life you just saw."
They don't care from heart kid.
They just want to be entertained.
I guess I didn't do you proud all in all.
But did you talk to the people?
Did you use your charm?
I can't, and you know that.
Corky?
You want to be as good as the game.
Don't you?
You know I do.
Then you gotta find yourself some charm kid.
How?
You'll think of something.
Hey man, why don't you...
Hi, I'm George Todson, NBC.
I'm to meet Mr. Ben Greene.
Oh, yes sir.
He's right inside.
Thank you.
Say my man, how come he goes ahead of us?
I guess this boy Withers is your latest sensation, hmm?
Oh yeah, sit down.
Yeah, since you booked him into a very classy spot Ben.
And I found him here.
You know, it's not easy getting him to move.
You want a beer?
It's safe.
Sure.
He likes this place?
Well, he bombed here his first time out, you know?
But he didn't get... hey, get him a beer garcon.
Sure, Budweiser?
But he didn't give up.
He just worked his ass off for a year.
He come back.
And he hit it big.
There's never been a magician like him.
You dragged me down here for a magician?
Come on Ben.
I run a goddamn network.
We can't book those guys on kiddy shows anymore.
Now listen, your old man got his start working for me you little fart.
Don't tell me what bombs.
Magic is misdirection.
That's all it is.
And misdirection is getting the people to look in the wrong place at the right times.
So?
So naturally, magic has had a little trouble on the tube.
Why?
Because you can't misdirect the goddamn camera.
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome for Mr. Corky Withers.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ordinary deck of cards.
Loaded with stage presence.
I can't decide, does he remind me more of Errol Flynn or Valentino?
Thank you.
Young lady, would you please pick any card you want?
As long as it's the big casino, ten of diamonds?
Will you show the audience please?
Dynamite opening Ben.
Does he actually get better?
That's hard to believe.
Well he got a little nervous on account he knows we're here.
My teacher was a great man.
His name was Merlin, and uh...
No, seriously his name was Merlin, Jr., and this is his version of the rising aces.
And here were are, here are the four aces.
One, two, three, four.
I'm going to place them back on top of the deck.
And would you please pick any card?
Just pick any card.
Good.
Look at the card, remember it, and cover the aces.
Thank you.
All right uh...
I'm sorry, I did that wrong.
You're not supposed to cover the aces in this trick.
Um, I'm sorry.
One sec.
He's gonna pull a five card left.
Watch him, just watch him, will ya?
Goddamn drunks.
He's not liftin' just the top card.
He's gonna grab five.
Sir, if you think you can do better, you're welcome to try.
Just gimme a hand getting up there schmucko.
And step aside.
Okay, you're on.
Okay.
What's going on.
Thank you.
You really think you're that good do you?
I'll guaran-fuckin'-tee ya I am.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ahhh...
You ruined the rising aces.
So what, screw it.
You see the broad with the big jugs?
You mean the ah, young lady in the feathers?
Yeah, I see her so what?
Wonder if she'ld like a roll in the shavings with me?
I don't think you're very funny.
Well they do.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A nice gimmick, the dummy.
What's his name?
Fats.
Don't encourage him.
I will now change a diamond into a heart.
I guess the reason I'm such a great lover is um...
I don't want to hear about your sex life if you don't mind.
Tell us all about yours then.
Everybody likes short stories.
Shhh, Don't encourage him please ladies and gentlemen.
That's really a clever shtick.
Thank you.
All right, pick a diamond.
Huh?
I said pick a diamond.
All right.
It can change into a heart while I'm holding it.
Well, go on, show the audience.
If you're so great, change it while I'm holding it.
You won't give it back to me?
Well that's another trick you've ruined.
Let's see,
I'll just have to think of something else.
You mean you're not gonna change my diamond into uh...
Jesus Christ.
What?
It turned into a heart while I was holding it.
How'd he do that?
How'd he do that?
How did he do it?
How many times do I have to tell you.
Do you want to get out of here alive?
The kids good, I'll give him that.
Sure he's good.
I got me maybe the best magician in 50 years.
Team'd with the first X-rated dummy on the block.
Eat your heart out.
You say he really bombed here first time?
Yes.
Of course he didn't have the dummy with him then.
The dummy helps.
No question.
Right.
Local talent?
No.
He was brought up near Grossinger's in the Catskills.
I think his old man was a limey.
Came here to work in a health club and gave massages.
Somethin' like that.
It's me.
Chick, It's old Gangrene.
Gangrene.
That's funny.
Quick into.
Corky, our visitor from New York, George Todson.
How do you do sir?
You have a lot of potential.
Hey what about me?
You're terrific too Fats.
Thanks Mr. Wigston,
I mean Tubeston.
Todson.
Todson.
Now that's what I call funny.
Hey, you'll strain your pacemaker.
Behave yourself.
Come here a second, will ya?
Ah, by the way, how did you change the diamond to the heart?
I'm the misdirection dummy.
While we're bullshitting', you could bring an elephant on to the stage.
Which is why this magician will not bomb on the tube.
Why?
Because the goddamn camera watches their faces and not Corky's hands.
So you live and you learn.
See ya.
Bye.
Yeah, all right.
How'd it go?
Sen-fuckin'-sational.
See I'm catching.
What happens next?
Well, we reel 'em in slow.
The same kind of low key build up we gave Steve Martin last year.
I'm not lettin' you near New York, till we're close to making a deal.
So I just stay here?
No, first, I'd like to book you in a small lounge in Vegas for the experience.
Then the area talk shows.
You know, Tom Snyder, Mike Douglas.
All leading to Carson.
And if he asks you to come back,
I think he will, that should do it.
So, you keep motor mouth here in line, while I work on them droolers at the network.
It should take five, maybe six months.
Now, when I buy you a free lunch at the Four Seasons in New York, you'll know you're home free.
Sound okay?
Yes sir.
You're a good kid Corky.
Hey, you know what I think?
No, what do you think?
We're gonna be a star.
Zachary!
Seems like I'm breaking the law.
I'll see that no one touches it sir.
No one must ever touch a Rolls, but a Rolls man.
Yes sir.
Margo, will you show this gentleman to Mr. Greene's table please?
Hi.
Hi.
Is everything all right?
They want me?
The uh, network people I mean.
May I?
Yeah, thank you.
Have a cigar for later Corky.
Take two, they're are big.
I invented conspicuous consumption.
Don't you forget that.
If you're trying to get my attention you got it.
Will you do me a favor kid, will you try not to turn shit heel.
It's almost an automatic once a guy makes it big.
I'd love to see you beat the odds.
Maybe I won't make it big.
Come on, tell me.
What is it.
Two years ago, you couldn't get arrested.
Two years from now you are going to have it all.
Corky, NBC wants a pilot special.
What's that?
What's that, it's what they gave Rich Little a while back.
Menu sir?
Ah, you see, when they're hot for somebody like they're hot for you, they make a contract which hinges on the first show.
And if it hits, you're off and running for a bunch more.
Terrific.
That's why they call me the Postman,
I always deliver.
Is it set and, everything?
It's set but it's not set, set.
There's agent stuff like who pays how much for publicity, how much for the guest stars.
You'll have to take a medical exam and stuff like that.
Now what's wrong.
Um...
I don't think I'm going to take the medical exam.
Any particular reason.
Principle.
What the hell does that mean, principle?
Do you remember that first night when you came backstage at the uh, Stardust and you said, you wouldn't mind representing me.
Do you remember what I said?
You're goddamn right.
You said that I could represent you but you didn't want to sign.
That was principle too.
Because if we're happy with each other, our word should be enough.
To hell with signing some piece of paper.
Why is this with the medical exam principle?
Because they're saying something wrong with me.
And I say I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I don't need any doctors poking around inside me that's all.
Are you serious about this?
I mean is this a deal breaker?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Sadie, Sadie.
I have to put you on hold.
Sadie, what's the first rule for being an agent?
Never forget an act that killed Lincoln.
Head of the class.
Get me Bernstein in Legal.
Corky has turned impossible.
I don't believe it.
Well, I should have been a cesspool cleaner like my mama wanted.
Corky's so cheap, last night he sent his girlfriend out to hustle.
It's not true, not true.
Just ignore him.
When she came back this morning, he asked how much she'd gotten and she said
"Sixteen dollars and ten cents".
Corky said "ten cents?
My God, who gave you ten cents?"
And she said "Everybody".
Dammit.
Everybody, she said,
Body, body, body.
Dody, dudy, duny.
And she said...
And she said... and she said everybody.
Hello?
I've been having meetings for hours.
I couldn't budge 'em Cork.
I thought you said they wanted me?
Well they do Cork, but...
Didn't you explain about the principle?
Now kid, this is network policy.
It's legal policy.
Now I'm sitting here with three of our genius lawyers, my God, their IQ's alone must total up to 100.
Now we have called NBC a dozen times and they are not,
I repeat not about to spend a half a million bucks only to find out on taping day that there's some kinda health problem.
There's no problem.
Corky!
Make 'em understand.
Well... shoo will you fellas.
Let me handle this alone.
Yep.
Good luck Ben.
Yeah.
Now kid I don't have to ask you what the trouble is.
'Cause I know what the trouble is.
I've told you once before.
It's just success kid.
Please believe me.
You want success but you're afraid of it.
Now that happens to everybody at this stage.
I'm not afraid.
Now you stay right there.
and I'll be right over and we'll talk it through.
I'm not afraid.
Hang tight kid.
I'm on my way.
I won't be here.
We should hit Grossinger's inside another 20 minutes.
Never mind that.
Take your next left.
Here.
Keep going into town.
Your place?
I was brought up here.
Must remember it being a whole lot bigger huh?
No.
Wanna look around.
No point.
Family all gone huh?
Yeah.
Ah, you're lucky.
I live with four brothers.
All assholes.
I don't want to come on like some ghoul, but uh... do you got people in there?
People?
Just family.
You look a lot like yourself, you know that?
Yeah, I caught you on the Carson Show a couple times.
You must make a ton for that huh?
How'd you luck into that?
You know?
See, I sing great.
I know they'd cream over me.
My agent, William Morris, arranged it.
Is this Morris guy a personal friend of Carson?
Is that how that works?
William Morris is the name of a agency, not a guy.
Oh.
Hold it, right here.
Pull over to your left.
Fine.
Hey, this is Lake Melody ain't it?
I'll be right back.
Anybody?
Anybody home?
What do you want?
A cabin.
We're kinda closed.
Something above the lake is what I'm after.
It's just the kind of place I'm looking for.
I won't be disturbed here.
That's for sure.
But like I said, we're kinda closed.
$50 bucks a night.
In advance.
We just re-opened.
If you don't want me waitin'?
How you gonna get to Grossinger's?
I'll call a local cab when I need one.
How much?
$80 bucks, not countin' tip.
Okay.
Uh...
Here's a hundred for the driving, and another hundred, for a favor.
Name it.
You didn't bring me here, okay?
Okay.
Good.
Thanks.
What you see is what you get.
The um, the bedroom's back there and the kitchenette and the bathroom across.
Fine.
Here's your key.
Help!
Help!
Calling all schmucko's.
Save me.
Hi.
Hi.
Jesus Christ.
This is Grossinger's?
I wonder if her ass is on ball bearings.
Shut up.
Oh, sounds like I stepped on a corn.
Sorry.
It's just that I carried her picture all these years.
And she didn't remember me.
Aw...
He didn't remember me.
Hello?
Sorry to bother you.
Oh, that's all right.
No soap.
I didn't think you'd like it.
You leaving now?
No I didn't mean no soap that way.
I meant there wasn't any soap, or towels either.
Oh, come on in here and grab one.
Oh, oh my God, you brought Fats.
You thought Peg didn't remember.
Aw...
You knew who I was too?
Yeah.
Well why didn't you two at least grunt at each other?
He's just as cute as he is on the tube?
Cute?
Virile yes.
Sexy yes.
Ronald Reagan is cute.
Oh please, could I hold him,
I'll be careful.
Oh, he's heavy.
Husky you bimbo.
His lips didn't move.
That's because you're not stroking my levers sweetheart.
Right in there.
Oh, she goosed me.
Ignore him, go right ahead.
Okay.
There.
And there.
I see.
I love it.
Hey, she hugged me to her bosom.
I suspect she found me irresistible.
Don't we all?
She asked you over for dinner, huh?
How long are you going to stay?
I don't know, why?
If you stayed late, that might mean you was getting hugged to her bosom too which just might make old Fats jealous and we wouldn't want that, would we now?
Hmm?
You never really told, why you were here.
I'm hiding.
Gotta get my head on straight.
My agent, he looks like the Ancient Mariner in that poem we hated in high school.
He's negotiating for a shot for me to maybe make it big.
We argued.
But I thought it was just principle.
The truth is probably I'm scared of success.
That's all.
You always were this weirdly timid person Cork.
That's for sure.
Your folks still run this place?
No, they took a motel in Florida.
Gave this place to me.
But I just couldn't make a go of it.
Too bad.
The Catskills are dying and that's the truth.
Me and Duke are lookin' to sell.
God, you're beautiful.
Don't I wish.
I had such a crush on you.
No one ever accused you of having good taste, Cork.
When I moved away I whittled you a present, a wooden heart.
You never gave it to me though.
I lost it before I got it finished.
I knew you had a crush on me.
I was always pretty for you.
I didn't say pretty.
You didn't pick up on my Duke mention either.
After all, he is my consort.
My spouse.
I'm very big on enlarging my vocabulary.
Are you very big on Duke?
We seem to separate what seems like, every full moon, it hasn't been your everyday
Walt Disney type marriage.
Where is he?
Quick business trip.
I'm sorry.
Tell me, does he... does he still look like James Dean?
Hey.
Hey.
Hearty burgundy.
Very medicinal.
Peg?
Admit it, now I'm beautiful.
How was the orgy?
Did you score?
The high point of the evening was when I reduced her to tears.
That-a-boy schmucko.
Hey, when are we movin' on?
Tomorrow.
The day after.
Soon.
Peggy Ann Snow, Peggy Ann Snow, please let me follow, where ever you go.
Why'd you close the door?
I'm contemplating taking a piss, do you mind?
Ooh, fancy yancy.
Hey stick your head out here one sec.
Was you thinkin' about her?
...stuff like that.
So how long did you work with this Merlin guy?
I worked for him, years.
But uh, he taught me everything.
But I never performed.
Never on my own.
Why not?
Probably afraid I'd fail.
Dope.
It wasn't 'til the week he took really sick.
And uh, he begged me that I got the guts to try.
Did you bring any tricks up with you.
No.
I don't do tricks.
Tricks means something set up beforehand.
A box with a fake lid.
A stacked deck of cards.
I don't do that.
Will you just use whatever's available?
Yeah.
Ah.
Here.
Amaze me.
A stone?
Oh come on will ya.
Well that was available.
Oh, do it again.
Do it again.
Certainly.
Oh, come on.
Okay.
You bastard.
You bastard.
I really love magic.
No magic, it's just skill.
All explainable.
I don't think I want to believe that.
Can you explain everything?
Pretty much.
What can't you explain.
Look I don't want to get into this.
Magic's just to entertain.
You're not supposed to take it seriously.
What can't you explain?
Merlin, his wife was his assistant before me.
They were close.
They really cared.
Those last days in the hospital with her he claimed he could read her mind.
You believe that don't you?
I don't know.
I want to I guess.
See in their act, they used to do a lot of phony telepathy crap.
Mostly cards.
Then at the end they both wanted to do it for real.
To prove to each other how much they cared, is how he put it.
Do you know the exact procedures they did and everything?
Sure.
Look, I don't want to get into this.
Oh, it'll be fun.
Come on.
I'd fail.
So what.
I don't want you thinkin' bad of me let's say.
Okay.
Forget the whole thing.
I'm trying to get away from pressure, please.
So who's putting you under pressure?
Not me.
Just thought it might be a kick.
But it's forgotten.
Now we've each shuffled a deck, okay?
Now you take mine.
So... just spread your cards like this.
Fine.
Okay.
Now take one card, any card.
Look at it.
And remember it.
Now what?
Now come on, you must really look at it.
I'm looking, I'm looking, don't be mad.
Okay.
Just concentrate on that one card.
Now gather your cards up.
Place the card back face down.
Good.
Just cut the cards once.
Just take my deck.
Look for your card.
When you find it, take it out.
Tell me when you've found it.
Okay.
Okay?
What happens now?
What happened with Merlin was uh, she put the card next to her heart.
And uh, he went through her deck kind of like this.
Uh...
What's my card?
I don't know.
You must really think hard.
Okay.
Okay, I'm thinking really hard.
Well?
I'm sorry.
Well don't stop.
I'm concentrating my ass off.
Okay.
My God it's red isn't it?
It's red.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
I give away nothing.
Come on concentrate, just concentrate.
Hey.
Show me.
We came close, what the hell.
Sit down Peg.
Get back down.
That was your fault.
You started out fine.
But then you let me drift.
Jesus Cork, forget it.
I was in bad shape in New York, Peg, and I had to run.
Where do you go when there's no place to go?
You go home.
Except there was nothing but empty houses and old cemeteries.
And I figured I'd stop by here and ask your folks about you.
Where were you living, what city, how many kids?
Never expected to find you here.
I've loved you all my goddamn life.
I needed a piece of good news about Peggy Ann Snow.
Shuffle the goddamn cards fast.
We're gonna do it right this time.
I just know we will, because we both want it a lot.
Give me your deck.
Take my deck.
Spread the cards.
Take your card.
Pick it out.
Look at it.
Put it back on top.
Now, cut the deck once.
Take my deck, look for your card.
When you find it tell me.
Look at me.
Should I think now.
Yes, very hard.
I am.
You're not, I can tell by your eyes your not.
Well I'm frightened is why.
Nothing to be afraid of.
If it goes bad.
It won't go bad, not if two people want something as much as this.
There must be nothing in your mind but your card.
Nothing in your mind but...
What?
My card.
Concentrate.
Just think, think hard.
Is it...
Please is it...
Is it the three of clubs?
The three of clubs?
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I'll bet they don't give service like that at Grossinger's.
Drop in again in 15 years.
Why the jokes?
I'm kind of feeling my way along.
I never fooled around before.
True.
I guess sex wasn't that big a deal in my life.
What about Duke?
Mainly he blew in my ear a lot.
True.
I deceived him into thinking it drives me mad.
He tongues away at me and I moan a lot but... secretly I'm making a grocery list.
Oh, I can be a very crappy lady if I put my mind to it.
Come here.
Let's you and me take off.
Just us.
You don't care for Duke and you know it.
I dump Duke, and you'd leave Fats, that's your offer?
Yeah, just say the word and we'll go.
A man appears after 15 years.
Says run away with me.
A girl ought to at least be able to take a bubble bath.
Think about it, right?
Why in the hell were you so shy all those years ago, huh?
Hey what do you say sports fans.
What's the matter?
Getting your period?
Feeling kinda blue.
I miss the city bad.
Oh the country grows on you.
So does fungus.
I told you once already we'd leave.
When?
When I want to, now drop it.
What's so great here?
Tell me that.
Simmer down okay?
Okay.
Hey, how's this for a solution?
You stay around here and turn hayseed and I'll head back to Manhattan.
I take it the silence means no?
Discussion's over.
That's all.
I want out of here!
Simmer the hell down!
Just because...
Watch it mister!
Just because some...
You've been warned!
Just because some sagging bitch of an ingenue drops her pants for you!
Shut up!
Corky, you do it so good.
You're even better than the garbage men.
Hey Ben, how do you like it?
I think it's going to be terrific.
What's with Gangrene?
Blue Cross repossess your tongue?
Come on in, shut up.
Come on in Ben, I'll do the whole routine for you?
How the hell did you ever find me.
You're amazing.
I'll bet it was that kid cab driver.
He must've called the office and found ya.
Is that right, that's it?
Yeah, I told him I was with William Morris.
He looked like a hustler, so I gave him a hundred to shut him up.
How much did you give him to talk.
Doesn't matter.
Right, right, right, right, right.
Right, you're here, that's the main thing.
That's it, right.
Come on, grab yourself a seat.
And uh, watch.
Just remember that I haven't got this anywhere near performance level yet.
How long ya been like this kid?
Like what?
Oh my God, you don't think that was for real?
How'd you think I rehearse?
It's no good.
It's for the act for Christ sakes!
Watch now.
Ladies and Gentlemen, for your viewing pleasure.
My version of the Miser's Dream.
Was it a wet dream?
Shut up.
Imagine if you will.
When I have a wet dream all that happens is I wake up covered with sawdust.
If you don't stop interrupting
I'm going to put a contract out on you with a mafia woodpecker.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a woodpecker.
Would you be quiet.
Don't encourage him, ladies and gentlemen.
It's really a great beginning, isn't it Ben.
Is this why you wouldn't take the medical exam?
You figured somebody'd find out?
Bullshit!
I'll take the stupid exam!
I was afraid of success like you said.
I needed to get my head on straight.
I'll take the exam, do the show, whatever you want.
What I want kid?
What I want is for you to see somebody.
Who would I see?
Quit with the games!
Quit with the yelling!
Shut up!
He should show a little grati-fuckin'-tude.
You been slaving' away, comin' up with the great new stuff.
That was blockbuster material mister.
When I come back with Woody the Woodpecker, they'll plotz in Vegas.
That's funny.
Nothin's funny.
Not anymore.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna make a few phone calls.
Tell people you mean?
Corky, you ain't in control!
Ben, you owe me a listen don't you think?
Yeah, I was kind of out of control back in the city.
I uh...
I could feel myself starting to slip down the iceberg.
So you took off, and now you're fine?
Sure.
On account of Peg.
The local town pump, terrific knockers.
Look Fats, please.
Come on will ya?
Sorry.
Um...
I've known her ever since high school.
I never figured I'd have a chance with her, but uh, now everything's changed.
She believes in me.
Listen... girls are for down the line kid.
Right now, you gotta let me help you.
I know a lot of people.
Beautiful doctors.
He means headshrinkers.
He just thinks you're a fruit cake.
He doesn't, he never said that, he's on our side.
He's the villain.
Don't forget that.
Never forget that.
Hey kid.
I'm gonna ask you to do something.
It's a little something anybody ought to be able to do.
Now if you can do it, fine.
We'll forget this whole thing.
But if you can't, we'll think about getting you to see somebody fast.
Is it a deal?
Name it.
Make Fats shut up for five minutes.
Five minutes.
I can make him shut up for five years.
Wonderful.
I feel like the village idiot if you want to know the truth.
Can we talk or is it going to be strictly semaphore?
How long so far?
There's 30 seconds.
Gosh, that's uh... four and a half minutes to go.
Think I'll make it?
Don't happen to have another of those do ya?
Thanks.
Take two they're big.
Remember when you said that Ben?
A pro never forgets his good lines kid.
How long now?
Coming up to a minute.
Do you think we'll laugh about this some day?
We might.
Make a terrific scene if you ever decide to write your autobiography.
Hey I know what you should call it, um...
"Failing Upwards", or, "How to Succeed in Show Business, by Outliving Everybody".
Two minutes yet?
A minute fortyfive.
This is very cruel of you, you know that?
I don't mean it to be.
I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive you.
Well, that would be sad.
Time?
It's uh... two and a half minutes to go.
I can't make it.
Well, I didn't think you could.
Hello everybody.
This is Mrs. Norman Main.
My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you.
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.
Nothing to give but blood sweat and tears.
Nothing to lose but your change.
Here he is boys.
Here he is world.
Here's Fats.
You're not lettin' him outta here.
He's the villain, don't forget that.
Hey, I think you better sit down.
Hey kid,
I have lived through Tallulah Bankhead and the death of Vaudeville.
I don't scare easy.
I need my chance.
Your only chance is to get help fast and that's what I'm going to see happens.
Don't, ever raise a hand to me again.
You're taking my one chance.
I'm your one chance.
He's right.
The Postman's right.
You're crazy.
I tried to stop him didn't I?
Tried, tried?
You failed.
God damn it.
Look at me.
You know it's the hatch for you.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I know that, and you know that.
But all those piss ant dolts who run the world, they hate us because we're special.
They'll put you somewhere deep and moody.
Don't talk that way please.
Cut the migraine shit.
Don't you care about anything?
Christ, don't you care about the girl?
Peg?
I love Peg.
I hope she loves you too.
So on visiting day she can bring crayons and the two of you's can color together.
What do you want from me?
You know goddamn well what.
I don't!
Liar.
Tell me!
Weakling.
I'm not, I'm not!
Stop the Postman!
I can't!
Gutless fuck!
I can't!
Stop the Postman!
How, how with what?
Me, me, me, me, me!
Cork?
What's up, what is it?
Oh, I meant to ask.
Do you want me make unthaw the asparagus tips, or the French-cut green beans?
Either.
No fair.
You're the man you've got to make the decision.
Asparagus tips.
Hey what are you doing in the woods?
Walkin', thinkin'.
About me?
You changin' your mind about me?
Jesus no.
Better not you bastard.
Well what is it?
My head, you broke it.
Well what'll I do?
Can't think, help me.
I will don't worry.
I'll take care.
Ahh...
You're hurtin' me.
Sorry.
There you are, that should do it.
That better?
I guess.
Good.
All right.
Does it show.
Uh...
Well, I'll slip you into your overall outfit with a cap.
And uh, nobody will be able to tell a thing.
Hey Fats?
Yeah.
I've been doin' some thinking.
Yeah.
What would you say if I uh... if I called the police and told?
You ain't being logical.
Look, Gangrene was taken care of because he was going to have you put away.
If you tell the cops, they'll have you put away.
Well what'll we do with him?
Bring me any identification he's got on him.
Why?
Time for a little dip.
After dinner get yourself some stones and stuff 'em in his pockets.
But I'm not that strong a swimmer.
Just dog paddle out to the middle and drop him down.
I know this lake.
There's snapping turtles out there.
Everybody said that.
Once there was a water moccasin scare.
I don't care if the Loch Ness monster's out there, and he's ravenous.
Do it beautifully.
Hello?
Good morning.
Coffee's on.
Coffee's ready.
Good.
Careful.
Uh, Duke got home very late last night.
He didn't much like the idea of me being here alone with a man.
He's watching us now.
Uh, do you think it's wise for me to come up there now?
I think he wants to watch us together.
Oh.
Give me five minutes.
Hey.
Has he got a telescope?
Because if he doesn't,
I'd like to say that going to bed with you is maybe the best three things that ever happened to me.
And I'd love some coffee.
And I adore you.
And I take it with cream and sugar.
And your breasts belong in the Louvre, which is a museum in Paris that I plan on visiting with you once you get wise and decide to leave the old ear blower.
Are you ever somethin'.
Hello?
We're in the kitchen.
Hi Duke.
How are you?
Come on in, sit down.
Yeah, thanks.
Doing okay.
You take your coffee how?
Everything.
Sorry I wasn't here to greet you.
Help with the entertaining and all.
But somebody's got to earn a living.
You're still in real estate right?
No, I gave that up.
It was dull.
What I really like is the out a doors.
Go fishing, hunting.
That probably seems dull to someone like you.
No, not at all.
Fine, thanks.
And I do a little selling' nowadays.
Sundries, like that.
I'm surprised Peg here didn't bring you up to date.
Well she may have.
The truth is, once I start drinking wine, you can forget about me.
Hey Duke, that stuff you sell?
You don't happen to have a penis do you?
My last one caught Dutch Elm Disease and it's murder getting an erection.
God damn, that's clever.
Don't tell schmucko.
Tell me.
'Cause I'm the talent.
Shhh...
Do you travel a lot in your work?
How do you do that?
I mean that's terrific.
I'm really glad you're here for me to see this.
Are you going to be good?
I mean it.
You promise?
Okay.
Ask him if he's glad I'm here too?
Yeah, the both of you.
Thank you.
How long are you going to be?
Quick as I can.
As long as it takes me to board up those far cabins.
Don't stay out too long.
You'll get soaked.
How'd I do.
Just unbelievable.
Too bad Fats wasn't here.
He might of been a little help.
Gotten a couple of laughs.
You're always unbelievable.
Oh, brains as well as boobs.
Corky, do you drive a Rolls?
No.
Well there's somebody's white Rolls parked down there.
Shit.
It's gotta be Gangrene's.
Why would he leave it though.
Who's is it?
My agent.
He's rich as hell.
But still you just don't leave an $80,000 car and walk away.
He must have come looking for me.
Looking for you?
Yeah.
He's left the keys.
Yeah, look if I level with you, you won't let this get around?
I'm in hiding.
A lot of career problems.
I haven't been behaving all that normal.
Well can you find out what's happened to him.
This cars been here a couple of hours.
Yeah, I'll sure as hell try.
Hey, would you mind getting it unstuck?
Me driving an $80,000 car,
I'd mind that a lot.
Sadie?
Sadie?
It's me.
Is he in?
Please.
Don't yell at me Goddamn it.
I'm sick of hearing about my erratic behavior.
How the hell did you ever find me.
I tipped that bastard cabbie so he wouldn't tell.
We were on a long walk is why you didn't find anybody.
Never mind who the we is, finish about the car.
Ha, ha.
I'd love to have seen that.
You hitchhiking a ride to Grossinger's.
Why didn't you have 'em come and un-stick the car.
Quit yelling.
I should a known, nobody touches your Rolls but a Rolls man.
Sorry.
Duke's on his way.
Yes sir.
That was the we.
Yes sir, a lot.
It's not ridiculous.
We grew up together.
Yes she's married.
But I think she's leaving him for me.
The marriage was over.
I'm not talking about puppy love Ben.
I'm talking about salvation.
Some fish.
Some fish he takes me for.
Your old pal I'm talking about.
I suspected.
His story's so full a holes.
Why do you keep repeating that?
So a car is here, who care?
Besides, Corky agrees with you.
It's a crazy story, but there it is.
Some happy coincidence.
A guy drives 90 miles and you and Corky just happen to be off in the woods when he's snooping'.
You put out for him in the woods did ya?
I love it when you're drinking.
Well why didn't you tell me about this Goddamn legendary walk before?
No comment.
Listen,
I know his story's bullshit because I got the car out of the mud and it was nothing.
If I can do it, anybody can.
Maybe he tried.
Maybe he couldn't.
He's old.
Corky never said he was old.
He must of to me.
When?
When we were having dinner, probably.
He got squiffed fast and flaked out.
That's what he said earlier.
And how did you know he was old, did you see him?
Answer me, I'm talking to you!
No, I didn't see him.
Why not?
He must've wrung the bell.
I mean the guy drives 90 miles, he's gonna ring the Goddamn doorbell, wouldn't you agree?
I didn't hear any bell.
Now quit this.
Why not?
What were you doin' that was so...
Did he ring while you were screwing', is that it?
That is it isn't it?
No it isn't.
Why didn't you invite him in to watch?
Shut your dirty mouth.
Did you screw Corky?
No!
I'll pound you all day, you keep lying!
I'm not lying!
The truth, the goddamn truth!
Did you fuck him?
No I didn't!
But I wanted to.
Come on, it'll be fun.
If you don't like fishin'
I'll let you row.
Just had a good talk with Peg.
Like to have one with you now.
I'll grab a jacket.
Where is Peg?
She's in town making a decision, she said.
Oh.
What are you doin' that for?
Uh, habit.
Hey, we trust each other don't we?
Of course.
You seem upset.
Should I be?
Get in the front.
What are you lookin' for?
Nothin'.
You're the one wants to fish.
Why don't you try over there.
Here I'll do the rowing.
I know the best holes.
When I get us there you can take over.
I'm not much on booze.
I told you that.
You told me a lot of things.
What's that supposed to mean?
Peg said you screwed her last night.
Damn.
I told her to keep it a secret.
You think it's funny do you?
Is that why you brought me out here?
Try to get me to admit to something that never happened?
If it is I'd like to go back in now Duke.
What she said was, she wanted to go to bed with you.
I'm loosin' her Corky,
And I don't know what to do.
All she does is talk about you Duke.
You're not losing anybody.
What I said before, about quitting the real estate business, there was never any real estate business to quit.
She came in when I was on top.
And she stuck with me all the way down.
Goddamn it.
Oh, that's heavy.
Duke, I said I'd like to go back in now.
This feels like a whale.
God, I'm cold, let's get the hell in.
It's comin' loose.
Hey you're breakin' my pole.
I'm trying to help you, that's all.
Well don't help.
It's comin' now.
It's comin'.
Goddamn log.
Any of that scotch left?
Thought you didn't like booze?
I'm freezing my nuts off, that's all.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I wonder who he is.
See what his wallet says.
Jesus Christ,
I was thinking' he might be your Rolls Royce guy.
Gangrene?
You must be kidding' me.
He's about 6'3".
Nothin'.
He's stripped clean.
It doesn't make sense.
Must be some identification.
Jesus Christ, he might still be alive.
Fantastic.
I'll do the kiss of life.
You run up to the house, call Normandy Hospital.
Tell 'em to get over.
Right.
And stay at the house 'til they get there so you can direct 'em straight here.
Gotcha.
Ben Greene.
Gangrene.
Son of a bitch.
He is the Rolls guy.
Oh.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Don't panic.
My God, what have you done!
I said don't panic.
My God, what am I going to do?
Well pick me up dumb dumb and I'll tell ya.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Well sit down then dummy.
Alright.
You're gonna zoom to my suitcase and whip out one of those nice long pieces of canvas.
Well clean my face and you won't throw up.
Okay.
You're gonna take the canvas and you're gonna wrap part around Duke here, and part of it around Gangrene.
Then you're gonna get a nice big rock and wrap the rest around it.
Take that out a my mouth.
Then you're gonna row out and dump the bundle over the side.
And if you do it right,
I'll be able to say atta boy schmucko.
Two birds with one stone.
Hi.
Hi.
You've had quite a day I guess.
Whatever.
Where's Duke.
We had a blow out.
He tried to get me to admit we'd gone to bed together.
But uh... when he couldn't he told me he was going to go hunting and I should get the hell out by the time he got back.
Are you coming with me?
Are you coming with me?
I gotta know.
Who wins, me or Duke?
If I'm a prize, then you're the winner.
And as soon as Duke gets back and I can tell him in person that I'm leaving, we can take off.
Gee you know I, I...
I don't think you should put yourself through a big emotional scene like that, do you?
Well, I gotta leave Duke with his pride.
We spent a lotta years together and uh... he's gotta understand that he didn't fail.
We failed together.
So let's the both of us pack okay.
Don't try arguing me out of this.
He's got to be home soon.
He can't hunt at night time right?
Okay.
Oh, my God.
She's leaving Duke for you.
Fan-fucking-gradly, fan-fucking-tastic.
Thank you sports fans.
Well where are we off to?
Now don't get emotional about this.
About what, about what?
I think maybe there's just going to be two of us on the honeymoon.
What's the punch line?
You're gonna leave me behind?
Come on buddy, quit the kiddin'.
My head's on straight on now.
I want to get to know her, that's all.
Take her places.
Show her things.
Paris, maybe, like that.
The Eiffel Tower.
The Louvre.
You know?
Schmucko, you've never been to Paris.
What's this show her routine?
I'll be good.
You'll see.
I wanna see Paris too.
You want me to come crawling?
You want me to beg?
Okay, this is me, Fats, and I'm beggin'.
It's not easy for me either.
It is.
It is easy.
You wont be alone.
I'll tell.
What will you tell?
Everything.
I will.
I swear.
In the middle of the act, one night, when you don't expect it.
I'll scream, there's bodies in Lake Melody.
I don't see that happening.
I'm doing a single now.
Duke?
Duke?
How'd it go?
Duke understand.
We haven't talked yet.
You mean he isn't back yet.
Christ Peg.
Got kinda scary up there.
And I wanted a drink, but I didn't much wanna drink alone.
Well let's just go.
Let's get the hell out.
Send him a telegram.
I'm sorry, my mind's made up.
Besides, he can't be much longer.
You don't know that.
He was drinking heavy when he left here.
Did he take a flashlight with him?
Did you notice?
All I noticed was that big Goddamn elephant gun he was carrying when he hinted I vacate the premises.
Come on, it's stupid waiting around.
Then I'm stupid.
I didn't say you were stupid.
I said waiting was.
I'm aware of your opinion on the subject.
Well try agreeing with me for once.
Instead of being stubborn.
Give it a rest Cork.
Aaah...
Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you.
Fasten your seatbelts everybody.
It's going to be a bumpy night.
I'm here to save you two from yourselves.
Want me to do something dazzling.
You do magic too?
Corky does magic.
I only do tricks.
Hey I got just the thing Peg.
Bring me a couple a decks of cards and I'll read your mind.
What do you mean?
I'll pull the same card from your deck that you pull from mine.
That's not a trick.
You can't do that.
Sure.
You just peek at the bottom card after shuffling and it's easy as apple pie.
Corky makes a big deal production number out of it sometimes.
Like when he's got some bimbo stewardess he wants to screw.
He makes him think their minds have touched.
Never fails.
You'll never know how many people want to believe in magic.
Oh shit.
Peg.
Peg please.
Please, please come...
Were you laughing every second.
Please, please.
Was I funny you bastard son of a bitch?
Oh...
Let me explain.
Hey, hey.
Jesus.
Listen to me you schmuck.
You gotta please just answer me one small question?
Why'd you think I blew the whistle?
Ah, because I was leaving.
Because you were jealous.
Wrong schmucko.
I did it because I could.
See?
Why didn't you stop me?
Answer, you didn't because you couldn't.
Look at him.
He still doesn't understand.
Better sit down kid while I hit you with an explanation.
Ever since we got together,
I laid low.
It was best for the act.
I let you share the limelight.
If there's one thing about me, I'm big.
But then earlier today, when I begged ya, pleaded not to be left behind and you pissed ice water all over me, well, that tore it.
If I'm boring you, please walk around.
I don't care.
Fats don't start in on me.
Please don't.
Listen, I took a failure.
With the charm of Tricky Dickey Nixon.
I made us skyrocket.
It's not gonna be you and her, it's gonna stay you and me.
Except from now on even that's changed.
It's me and you.
You said I've got a weak stomach.
You look tired.
I'm not.
Then what are you yawning for?
I'm not yawning.
You gotta wake you up.
Crawl around.
That should help.
You think?
Hey yeah, it does help.
Say thank you Fats.
Thanks.
Thanks Fats.
With feeling, like I'm doing.
I'm filled with greatest fucking joy.
Gee you've got talent after all.
Let's see what else you can do.
Fats says smile.
Fats says frown.
Fats says touch the ceiling.
Fats says spin around.
Fats says get a knife.
What?
Get a knife.
Come on.
From my suitcase.
Yeah.
I know where it is.
I wonder what we could do with it?
Hey, I could whittle something.
I'm good at that, and fast too, name it.
No.
I'm looking for something with a little more pizzazz.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't do it.
You really love old Peg don't ya?
Oh please, don't kill her.
Schmucko easy.
I wouldn't dream of depriving you of that pleasure.
No, I can't do it!
There's that old bug-a-boo of yours again.
lack of confidence.
I won't and you can't make me!
Wow, I really stepped on a corn that time.
If I can't make ya, I can't make ya.
How's your head Cork?
Fine!
Thought you might be getting' a migraine.
No!
Shows how wrong you can be.
Open those baby blues.
Looks to me like one of those gut wrenchers.
It's getting bad fast.
Please!
Drilling right into the brain is it?
Surprise.
Came fast.
It can go fast.
Yeah.
Oh yes.
Not so deep anymore?
No, not so deep.
It'll all be gone soon.
Uh...
Thanks Fats.
Want it a hundred times worse, and a hundred days long?
No.
Then take the knife on up the hill lover.
And kiss the girl goodbye.
Duke?
I left schmucko down at the cabin.
Open up huh?
You and me gotta have a quick palaver.
Corky there's nothin' to say.
I told ya, he's at the cabin.
You and me are the only ones can straighten this out.
Go away Cork.
Fats.
All right, go away Fats.
That's better.
At least we know who we are now.
Hey, I've got a present that'll make you smile.
Promise it will.
He made it for you Peg.
For you to remember him by.
See, he's leaving now and he wants you to have this.
Have what?
A wooden heart.
He whittled it for you before he sent me up.
He's quick with his hands.
Leave it outside the door.
Take his heart Peg.
So he'll know you don't feel contempt for him.
Oh, I never felt that.
At least that's something.
I'll leave it by the door.
Bye.
Wait a minute, you didn't leave.
Brains as well as boobs.
Anytime you feel like playing with my levers you'll call?
Sure, sure.
Peggy Ann Snow,
Peggy Ann Snow, please let me follow wherever you go.
She liked my heart.
She smiled when she picked it up.
She looked so pleased and everything.
I made her happy.
Me?
No tricks or anything.
What's wrong.
I don't know how to say this, since I haven't got a stomach, but my stomach hurts.
Bad?
Gettin' bad.
Gettin' real bad.
Yeah.
What's goin' on?
We're dying I think is what it is?
Dyin'?
Yeah,
I put the knife deep in me.
Christ it's spreadin'.
Yeah.
Don't leave me here alone.
Don't worry.
Can you get over here.
I'll try.
Put me flat.
Here.
Why didn't you leave?
Go with her when you had the chance?
She'd never of gone with me.
She'd have turned me down.
I couldn't even get her to open the door by myself.
It was never me.
Always us.
Schmucko.
Us was you.
What?
It was you all the time.
I hope I don't die first is all.
I think we'll go together.
Chances are.
Hey Cork?
Hey it's me.
I changed my mind.
Let's give it a whack okay?
See how it goes?
What do ya say.
I'm warning you Cork, don't play hard to get with me.
'Cause I'm a woman see, and I can always change my mind again.
You may not get this oppor-fuckin'-tunity tomorrow.
Did you knock 'em dead Corky?
I did everything right.
You mean it went perfect?
You're first time on your own.
Me not there to see.
Don't make it more than it was.
Now don't give me that inferiority crap.
Now, did the lift go okay?
I never did it better.
Open.
Now, when you're rich and famous, don't you forget me.
I'll never forget you.
Open.
There are not three guys alive that can do what you can with those cards.
I'm tellin' ya kid, you're as good as the game.
Sure, sure, sure.
Another Houdini.
Where you scared?
I sure was when I started.
Well I wasn't calm.
But then,
I wasn't all that worried.
I figured I'd uh... done all the practicing I could so what the hell.
Were you the only magician?
Yes sir.
The men all wanted to be Bob Dylan and the girls did mostly Barbara Walters imitations or sang Dolly Parton songs.
Some of them panicked before they got up to perform.
Not you though?
No, not me.
See, the guy who was in charge of everything ran things so well.
He had one of those hourglass egg timers and when he turned it over you started, and when the sand was finished so were you.
Good evening.
Tell me kid, did you begin with some flourishes?
Yeah.
You always taught me that they were the best attention grabbers.
Was I, was I right?
It was amazing.
Everybody quick shut up and watched.
No more whispering.
Nothing.
And once you had 'em Corky, then what did you do?
Well I quick told this pudgy lady at the ringside to please pick any card she wanted as long as it was the big casino, the ten of diamonds.
Okay, would you please show the card to the audience?
And I forced it on her perfectly.
Everybody loved it a lot and laughed.
And then I went straight into rising aces.
Did the lift work great?
Yes sir.
The sand was really running out of that hourglass.
And I told myself to forget it and just concentrate on the moves.
So I took my time and made it work and everybody applauded like crazy.
So I just took a couple of bows and I got off.
Oh kid.
Don't bullshit me.
I really did do everything right.
Really.
Only nobody much cared.
And?
And?
Go on.
I guess I just cracked.
"You stupid sons of bitches, "I said,"
"Don't you know how hard that was?"
"That's a thousand hours of my life you just saw."
They don't care from heart kid.
They just want to be entertained.
I guess I didn't do you proud all in all.
But did you talk to the people?
Did you use your charm?
I can't, and you know that.
Corky?
You want to be as good as the game.
Don't you?
You know I do.
Then you gotta find yourself some charm kid.
How?
You'll think of something.
Hey man, why don't you...
Hi, I'm George Todson, NBC.
I'm to meet Mr. Ben Greene.
Oh, yes sir.
He's right inside.
Thank you.
Say my man, how come he goes ahead of us?
I guess this boy Withers is your latest sensation, hmm?
Oh yeah, sit down.
Yeah, since you booked him into a very classy spot Ben.
And I found him here.
You know, it's not easy getting him to move.
You want a beer?
It's safe.
Sure.
He likes this place?
Well, he bombed here his first time out, you know?
But he didn't get... hey, get him a beer garcon.
Sure, Budweiser?
But he didn't give up.
He just worked his ass off for a year.
He come back.
And he hit it big.
There's never been a magician like him.
You dragged me down here for a magician?
Come on Ben.
I run a goddamn network.
We can't book those guys on kiddy shows anymore.
Now listen, your old man got his start working for me you little fart.
Don't tell me what bombs.
Magic is misdirection.
That's all it is.
And misdirection is getting the people to look in the wrong place at the right times.
So?
So naturally, magic has had a little trouble on the tube.
Why?
Because you can't misdirect the goddamn camera.
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome for Mr. Corky Withers.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ordinary deck of cards.
Loaded with stage presence.
I can't decide, does he remind me more of Errol Flynn or Valentino?
Thank you.
Young lady, would you please pick any card you want?
As long as it's the big casino, ten of diamonds?
Will you show the audience please?
Dynamite opening Ben.
Does he actually get better?
That's hard to believe.
Well he got a little nervous on account he knows we're here.
My teacher was a great man.
His name was Merlin, and uh...
No, seriously his name was Merlin, Jr., and this is his version of the rising aces.
And here were are, here are the four aces.
One, two, three, four.
I'm going to place them back on top of the deck.
And would you please pick any card?
Just pick any card.
Good.
Look at the card, remember it, and cover the aces.
Thank you.
All right uh...
I'm sorry, I did that wrong.
You're not supposed to cover the aces in this trick.
Um, I'm sorry.
One sec.
He's gonna pull a five card left.
Watch him, just watch him, will ya?
Goddamn drunks.
He's not liftin' just the top card.
He's gonna grab five.
Sir, if you think you can do better, you're welcome to try.
Just gimme a hand getting up there schmucko.
And step aside.
Okay, you're on.
Okay.
What's going on.
Thank you.
You really think you're that good do you?
I'll guaran-fuckin'-tee ya I am.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ahhh...
You ruined the rising aces.
So what, screw it.
You see the broad with the big jugs?
You mean the ah, young lady in the feathers?
Yeah, I see her so what?
Wonder if she'ld like a roll in the shavings with me?
I don't think you're very funny.
Well they do.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A nice gimmick, the dummy.
What's his name?
Fats.
Don't encourage him.
I will now change a diamond into a heart.
I guess the reason I'm such a great lover is um...
I don't want to hear about your sex life if you don't mind.
Tell us all about yours then.
Everybody likes short stories.
Shhh, Don't encourage him please ladies and gentlemen.
That's really a clever shtick.
Thank you.
All right, pick a diamond.
Huh?
I said pick a diamond.
All right.
It can change into a heart while I'm holding it.
Well, go on, show the audience.
If you're so great, change it while I'm holding it.
You won't give it back to me?
Well that's another trick you've ruined.
Let's see,
I'll just have to think of something else.
You mean you're not gonna change my diamond into uh...
Jesus Christ.
What?
It turned into a heart while I was holding it.
How'd he do that?
How'd he do that?
How did he do it?
How many times do I have to tell you.
Do you want to get out of here alive?
The kids good, I'll give him that.
Sure he's good.
I got me maybe the best magician in 50 years.
Team'd with the first X-rated dummy on the block.
Eat your heart out.
You say he really bombed here first time?
Yes.
Of course he didn't have the dummy with him then.
The dummy helps.
No question.
Right.
Local talent?
No.
He was brought up near Grossinger's in the Catskills.
I think his old man was a limey.
Came here to work in a health club and gave massages.
Somethin' like that.
It's me.
Chick, It's old Gangrene.
Gangrene.
That's funny.
Quick into.
Corky, our visitor from New York, George Todson.
How do you do sir?
You have a lot of potential.
Hey what about me?
You're terrific too Fats.
Thanks Mr. Wigston,
I mean Tubeston.
Todson.
Todson.
Now that's what I call funny.
Hey, you'll strain your pacemaker.
Behave yourself.
Come here a second, will ya?
Ah, by the way, how did you change the diamond to the heart?
I'm the misdirection dummy.
While we're bullshitting', you could bring an elephant on to the stage.
Which is why this magician will not bomb on the tube.
Why?
Because the goddamn camera watches their faces and not Corky's hands.
So you live and you learn.
See ya.
Bye.
Yeah, all right.
How'd it go?
Sen-fuckin'-sational.
See I'm catching.
What happens next?
Well, we reel 'em in slow.
The same kind of low key build up we gave Steve Martin last year.
I'm not lettin' you near New York, till we're close to making a deal.
So I just stay here?
No, first, I'd like to book you in a small lounge in Vegas for the experience.
Then the area talk shows.
You know, Tom Snyder, Mike Douglas.
All leading to Carson.
And if he asks you to come back,
I think he will, that should do it.
So, you keep motor mouth here in line, while I work on them droolers at the network.
It should take five, maybe six months.
Now, when I buy you a free lunch at the Four Seasons in New York, you'll know you're home free.
Sound okay?
Yes sir.
You're a good kid Corky.
Hey, you know what I think?
No, what do you think?
We're gonna be a star.
Zachary!
Seems like I'm breaking the law.
I'll see that no one touches it sir.
No one must ever touch a Rolls, but a Rolls man.
Yes sir.
Margo, will you show this gentleman to Mr. Greene's table please?
Hi.
Hi.
Is everything all right?
They want me?
The uh, network people I mean.
May I?
Yeah, thank you.
Have a cigar for later Corky.
Take two, they're are big.
I invented conspicuous consumption.
Don't you forget that.
If you're trying to get my attention you got it.
Will you do me a favor kid, will you try not to turn shit heel.
It's almost an automatic once a guy makes it big.
I'd love to see you beat the odds.
Maybe I won't make it big.
Come on, tell me.
What is it.
Two years ago, you couldn't get arrested.
Two years from now you are going to have it all.
Corky, NBC wants a pilot special.
What's that?
What's that, it's what they gave Rich Little a while back.
Menu sir?
Ah, you see, when they're hot for somebody like they're hot for you, they make a contract which hinges on the first show.
And if it hits, you're off and running for a bunch more.
Terrific.
That's why they call me the Postman,
I always deliver.
Is it set and, everything?
It's set but it's not set, set.
There's agent stuff like who pays how much for publicity, how much for the guest stars.
You'll have to take a medical exam and stuff like that.
Now what's wrong.
Um...
I don't think I'm going to take the medical exam.
Any particular reason.
Principle.
What the hell does that mean, principle?
Do you remember that first night when you came backstage at the uh, Stardust and you said, you wouldn't mind representing me.
Do you remember what I said?
You're goddamn right.
You said that I could represent you but you didn't want to sign.
That was principle too.
Because if we're happy with each other, our word should be enough.
To hell with signing some piece of paper.
Why is this with the medical exam principle?
Because they're saying something wrong with me.
And I say I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I don't need any doctors poking around inside me that's all.
Are you serious about this?
I mean is this a deal breaker?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Sadie, Sadie.
I have to put you on hold.
Sadie, what's the first rule for being an agent?
Never forget an act that killed Lincoln.
Head of the class.
Get me Bernstein in Legal.
Corky has turned impossible.
I don't believe it.
Well, I should have been a cesspool cleaner like my mama wanted.
Corky's so cheap, last night he sent his girlfriend out to hustle.
It's not true, not true.
Just ignore him.
When she came back this morning, he asked how much she'd gotten and she said
"Sixteen dollars and ten cents".
Corky said "ten cents?
My God, who gave you ten cents?"
And she said "Everybody".
Dammit.
Everybody, she said,
Body, body, body.
Dody, dudy, duny.
And she said...
And she said... and she said everybody.
Hello?
I've been having meetings for hours.
I couldn't budge 'em Cork.
I thought you said they wanted me?
Well they do Cork, but...
Didn't you explain about the principle?
Now kid, this is network policy.
It's legal policy.
Now I'm sitting here with three of our genius lawyers, my God, their IQ's alone must total up to 100.
Now we have called NBC a dozen times and they are not,
I repeat not about to spend a half a million bucks only to find out on taping day that there's some kinda health problem.
There's no problem.
Corky!
Make 'em understand.
Well... shoo will you fellas.
Let me handle this alone.
Yep.
Good luck Ben.
Yeah.
Now kid I don't have to ask you what the trouble is.
'Cause I know what the trouble is.
I've told you once before.
It's just success kid.
Please believe me.
You want success but you're afraid of it.
Now that happens to everybody at this stage.
I'm not afraid.
Now you stay right there.
and I'll be right over and we'll talk it through.
I'm not afraid.
Hang tight kid.
I'm on my way.
I won't be here.
We should hit Grossinger's inside another 20 minutes.
Never mind that.
Take your next left.
Here.
Keep going into town.
Your place?
I was brought up here.
Must remember it being a whole lot bigger huh?
No.
Wanna look around.
No point.
Family all gone huh?
Yeah.
Ah, you're lucky.
I live with four brothers.
All assholes.
I don't want to come on like some ghoul, but uh... do you got people in there?
People?
Just family.
You look a lot like yourself, you know that?
Yeah, I caught you on the Carson Show a couple times.
You must make a ton for that huh?
How'd you luck into that?
You know?
See, I sing great.
I know they'd cream over me.
My agent, William Morris, arranged it.
Is this Morris guy a personal friend of Carson?
Is that how that works?
William Morris is the name of a agency, not a guy.
Oh.
Hold it, right here.
Pull over to your left.
Fine.
Hey, this is Lake Melody ain't it?
I'll be right back.
Anybody?
Anybody home?
What do you want?
A cabin.
We're kinda closed.
Something above the lake is what I'm after.
It's just the kind of place I'm looking for.
I won't be disturbed here.
That's for sure.
But like I said, we're kinda closed.
$50 bucks a night.
In advance.
We just re-opened.
If you don't want me waitin'?
How you gonna get to Grossinger's?
I'll call a local cab when I need one.
How much?
$80 bucks, not countin' tip.
Okay.
Uh...
Here's a hundred for the driving, and another hundred, for a favor.
Name it.
You didn't bring me here, okay?
Okay.
Good.
Thanks.
What you see is what you get.
The um, the bedroom's back there and the kitchenette and the bathroom across.
Fine.
Here's your key.
Help!
Help!
Calling all schmucko's.
Save me.
Hi.
Hi.
Jesus Christ.
This is Grossinger's?
I wonder if her ass is on ball bearings.
Shut up.
Oh, sounds like I stepped on a corn.
Sorry.
It's just that I carried her picture all these years.
And she didn't remember me.
Aw...
He didn't remember me.
Hello?
Sorry to bother you.
Oh, that's all right.
No soap.
I didn't think you'd like it.
You leaving now?
No I didn't mean no soap that way.
I meant there wasn't any soap, or towels either.
Oh, come on in here and grab one.
Oh, oh my God, you brought Fats.
You thought Peg didn't remember.
Aw...
You knew who I was too?
Yeah.
Well why didn't you two at least grunt at each other?
He's just as cute as he is on the tube?
Cute?
Virile yes.
Sexy yes.
Ronald Reagan is cute.
Oh please, could I hold him,
I'll be careful.
Oh, he's heavy.
Husky you bimbo.
His lips didn't move.
That's because you're not stroking my levers sweetheart.
Right in there.
Oh, she goosed me.
Ignore him, go right ahead.
Okay.
There.
And there.
I see.
I love it.
Hey, she hugged me to her bosom.
I suspect she found me irresistible.
Don't we all?
She asked you over for dinner, huh?
How long are you going to stay?
I don't know, why?
If you stayed late, that might mean you was getting hugged to her bosom too which just might make old Fats jealous and we wouldn't want that, would we now?
Hmm?
You never really told, why you were here.
I'm hiding.
Gotta get my head on straight.
My agent, he looks like the Ancient Mariner in that poem we hated in high school.
He's negotiating for a shot for me to maybe make it big.
We argued.
But I thought it was just principle.
The truth is probably I'm scared of success.
That's all.
You always were this weirdly timid person Cork.
That's for sure.
Your folks still run this place?
No, they took a motel in Florida.
Gave this place to me.
But I just couldn't make a go of it.
Too bad.
The Catskills are dying and that's the truth.
Me and Duke are lookin' to sell.
God, you're beautiful.
Don't I wish.
I had such a crush on you.
No one ever accused you of having good taste, Cork.
When I moved away I whittled you a present, a wooden heart.
You never gave it to me though.
I lost it before I got it finished.
I knew you had a crush on me.
I was always pretty for you.
I didn't say pretty.
You didn't pick up on my Duke mention either.
After all, he is my consort.
My spouse.
I'm very big on enlarging my vocabulary.
Are you very big on Duke?
We seem to separate what seems like, every full moon, it hasn't been your everyday
Walt Disney type marriage.
Where is he?
Quick business trip.
I'm sorry.
Tell me, does he... does he still look like James Dean?
Hey.
Hey.
Hearty burgundy.
Very medicinal.
Peg?
Admit it, now I'm beautiful.
How was the orgy?
Did you score?
The high point of the evening was when I reduced her to tears.
That-a-boy schmucko.
Hey, when are we movin' on?
Tomorrow.
The day after.
Soon.
Peggy Ann Snow, Peggy Ann Snow, please let me follow, where ever you go.
Why'd you close the door?
I'm contemplating taking a piss, do you mind?
Ooh, fancy yancy.
Hey stick your head out here one sec.
Was you thinkin' about her?
...stuff like that.
So how long did you work with this Merlin guy?
I worked for him, years.
But uh, he taught me everything.
But I never performed.
Never on my own.
Why not?
Probably afraid I'd fail.
Dope.
It wasn't 'til the week he took really sick.
And uh, he begged me that I got the guts to try.
Did you bring any tricks up with you.
No.
I don't do tricks.
Tricks means something set up beforehand.
A box with a fake lid.
A stacked deck of cards.
I don't do that.
Will you just use whatever's available?
Yeah.
Ah.
Here.
Amaze me.
A stone?
Oh come on will ya.
Well that was available.
Oh, do it again.
Do it again.
Certainly.
Oh, come on.
Okay.
You bastard.
You bastard.
I really love magic.
No magic, it's just skill.
All explainable.
I don't think I want to believe that.
Can you explain everything?
Pretty much.
What can't you explain.
Look I don't want to get into this.
Magic's just to entertain.
You're not supposed to take it seriously.
What can't you explain?
Merlin, his wife was his assistant before me.
They were close.
They really cared.
Those last days in the hospital with her he claimed he could read her mind.
You believe that don't you?
I don't know.
I want to I guess.
See in their act, they used to do a lot of phony telepathy crap.
Mostly cards.
Then at the end they both wanted to do it for real.
To prove to each other how much they cared, is how he put it.
Do you know the exact procedures they did and everything?
Sure.
Look, I don't want to get into this.
Oh, it'll be fun.
Come on.
I'd fail.
So what.
I don't want you thinkin' bad of me let's say.
Okay.
Forget the whole thing.
I'm trying to get away from pressure, please.
So who's putting you under pressure?
Not me.
Just thought it might be a kick.
But it's forgotten.
Now we've each shuffled a deck, okay?
Now you take mine.
So... just spread your cards like this.
Fine.
Okay.
Now take one card, any card.
Look at it.
And remember it.
Now what?
Now come on, you must really look at it.
I'm looking, I'm looking, don't be mad.
Okay.
Just concentrate on that one card.
Now gather your cards up.
Place the card back face down.
Good.
Just cut the cards once.
Just take my deck.
Look for your card.
When you find it, take it out.
Tell me when you've found it.
Okay.
Okay?
What happens now?
What happened with Merlin was uh, she put the card next to her heart.
And uh, he went through her deck kind of like this.
Uh...
What's my card?
I don't know.
You must really think hard.
Okay.
Okay, I'm thinking really hard.
Well?
I'm sorry.
Well don't stop.
I'm concentrating my ass off.
Okay.
My God it's red isn't it?
It's red.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
I give away nothing.
Come on concentrate, just concentrate.
Hey.
Show me.
We came close, what the hell.
Sit down Peg.
Get back down.
That was your fault.
You started out fine.
But then you let me drift.
Jesus Cork, forget it.
I was in bad shape in New York, Peg, and I had to run.
Where do you go when there's no place to go?
You go home.
Except there was nothing but empty houses and old cemeteries.
And I figured I'd stop by here and ask your folks about you.
Where were you living, what city, how many kids?
Never expected to find you here.
I've loved you all my goddamn life.
I needed a piece of good news about Peggy Ann Snow.
Shuffle the goddamn cards fast.
We're gonna do it right this time.
I just know we will, because we both want it a lot.
Give me your deck.
Take my deck.
Spread the cards.
Take your card.
Pick it out.
Look at it.
Put it back on top.
Now, cut the deck once.
Take my deck, look for your card.
When you find it tell me.
Look at me.
Should I think now.
Yes, very hard.
I am.
You're not, I can tell by your eyes your not.
Well I'm frightened is why.
Nothing to be afraid of.
If it goes bad.
It won't go bad, not if two people want something as much as this.
There must be nothing in your mind but your card.
Nothing in your mind but...
What?
My card.
Concentrate.
Just think, think hard.
Is it...
Please is it...
Is it the three of clubs?
The three of clubs?
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I'll bet they don't give service like that at Grossinger's.
Drop in again in 15 years.
Why the jokes?
I'm kind of feeling my way along.
I never fooled around before.
True.
I guess sex wasn't that big a deal in my life.
What about Duke?
Mainly he blew in my ear a lot.
True.
I deceived him into thinking it drives me mad.
He tongues away at me and I moan a lot but... secretly I'm making a grocery list.
Oh, I can be a very crappy lady if I put my mind to it.
Come here.
Let's you and me take off.
Just us.
You don't care for Duke and you know it.
I dump Duke, and you'd leave Fats, that's your offer?
Yeah, just say the word and we'll go.
A man appears after 15 years.
Says run away with me.
A girl ought to at least be able to take a bubble bath.
Think about it, right?
Why in the hell were you so shy all those years ago, huh?
Hey what do you say sports fans.
What's the matter?
Getting your period?
Feeling kinda blue.
I miss the city bad.
Oh the country grows on you.
So does fungus.
I told you once already we'd leave.
When?
When I want to, now drop it.
What's so great here?
Tell me that.
Simmer down okay?
Okay.
Hey, how's this for a solution?
You stay around here and turn hayseed and I'll head back to Manhattan.
I take it the silence means no?
Discussion's over.
That's all.
I want out of here!
Simmer the hell down!
Just because...
Watch it mister!
Just because some...
You've been warned!
Just because some sagging bitch of an ingenue drops her pants for you!
Shut up!
Corky, you do it so good.
You're even better than the garbage men.
Hey Ben, how do you like it?
I think it's going to be terrific.
What's with Gangrene?
Blue Cross repossess your tongue?
Come on in, shut up.
Come on in Ben, I'll do the whole routine for you?
How the hell did you ever find me.
You're amazing.
I'll bet it was that kid cab driver.
He must've called the office and found ya.
Is that right, that's it?
Yeah, I told him I was with William Morris.
He looked like a hustler, so I gave him a hundred to shut him up.
How much did you give him to talk.
Doesn't matter.
Right, right, right, right, right.
Right, you're here, that's the main thing.
That's it, right.
Come on, grab yourself a seat.
And uh, watch.
Just remember that I haven't got this anywhere near performance level yet.
How long ya been like this kid?
Like what?
Oh my God, you don't think that was for real?
How'd you think I rehearse?
It's no good.
It's for the act for Christ sakes!
Watch now.
Ladies and Gentlemen, for your viewing pleasure.
My version of the Miser's Dream.
Was it a wet dream?
Shut up.
Imagine if you will.
When I have a wet dream all that happens is I wake up covered with sawdust.
If you don't stop interrupting
I'm going to put a contract out on you with a mafia woodpecker.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a woodpecker.
Would you be quiet.
Don't encourage him, ladies and gentlemen.
It's really a great beginning, isn't it Ben.
Is this why you wouldn't take the medical exam?
You figured somebody'd find out?
Bullshit!
I'll take the stupid exam!
I was afraid of success like you said.
I needed to get my head on straight.
I'll take the exam, do the show, whatever you want.
What I want kid?
What I want is for you to see somebody.
Who would I see?
Quit with the games!
Quit with the yelling!
Shut up!
He should show a little grati-fuckin'-tude.
You been slaving' away, comin' up with the great new stuff.
That was blockbuster material mister.
When I come back with Woody the Woodpecker, they'll plotz in Vegas.
That's funny.
Nothin's funny.
Not anymore.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna make a few phone calls.
Tell people you mean?
Corky, you ain't in control!
Ben, you owe me a listen don't you think?
Yeah, I was kind of out of control back in the city.
I uh...
I could feel myself starting to slip down the iceberg.
So you took off, and now you're fine?
Sure.
On account of Peg.
The local town pump, terrific knockers.
Look Fats, please.
Come on will ya?
Sorry.
Um...
I've known her ever since high school.
I never figured I'd have a chance with her, but uh, now everything's changed.
She believes in me.
Listen... girls are for down the line kid.
Right now, you gotta let me help you.
I know a lot of people.
Beautiful doctors.
He means headshrinkers.
He just thinks you're a fruit cake.
He doesn't, he never said that, he's on our side.
He's the villain.
Don't forget that.
Never forget that.
Hey kid.
I'm gonna ask you to do something.
It's a little something anybody ought to be able to do.
Now if you can do it, fine.
We'll forget this whole thing.
But if you can't, we'll think about getting you to see somebody fast.
Is it a deal?
Name it.
Make Fats shut up for five minutes.
Five minutes.
I can make him shut up for five years.
Wonderful.
I feel like the village idiot if you want to know the truth.
Can we talk or is it going to be strictly semaphore?
How long so far?
There's 30 seconds.
Gosh, that's uh... four and a half minutes to go.
Think I'll make it?
Don't happen to have another of those do ya?
Thanks.
Take two they're big.
Remember when you said that Ben?
A pro never forgets his good lines kid.
How long now?
Coming up to a minute.
Do you think we'll laugh about this some day?
We might.
Make a terrific scene if you ever decide to write your autobiography.
Hey I know what you should call it, um...
"Failing Upwards", or, "How to Succeed in Show Business, by Outliving Everybody".
Two minutes yet?
A minute fortyfive.
This is very cruel of you, you know that?
I don't mean it to be.
I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive you.
Well, that would be sad.
Time?
It's uh... two and a half minutes to go.
I can't make it.
Well, I didn't think you could.
Hello everybody.
This is Mrs. Norman Main.
My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you.
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.
Nothing to give but blood sweat and tears.
Nothing to lose but your change.
Here he is boys.
Here he is world.
Here's Fats.
You're not lettin' him outta here.
He's the villain, don't forget that.
Hey, I think you better sit down.
Hey kid,
I have lived through Tallulah Bankhead and the death of Vaudeville.
I don't scare easy.
I need my chance.
Your only chance is to get help fast and that's what I'm going to see happens.
Don't, ever raise a hand to me again.
You're taking my one chance.
I'm your one chance.
He's right.
The Postman's right.
You're crazy.
I tried to stop him didn't I?
Tried, tried?
You failed.
God damn it.
Look at me.
You know it's the hatch for you.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I know that, and you know that.
But all those piss ant dolts who run the world, they hate us because we're special.
They'll put you somewhere deep and moody.
Don't talk that way please.
Cut the migraine shit.
Don't you care about anything?
Christ, don't you care about the girl?
Peg?
I love Peg.
I hope she loves you too.
So on visiting day she can bring crayons and the two of you's can color together.
What do you want from me?
You know goddamn well what.
I don't!
Liar.
Tell me!
Weakling.
I'm not, I'm not!
Stop the Postman!
I can't!
Gutless fuck!
I can't!
Stop the Postman!
How, how with what?
Me, me, me, me, me!
Cork?
What's up, what is it?
Oh, I meant to ask.
Do you want me make unthaw the asparagus tips, or the French-cut green beans?
Either.
No fair.
You're the man you've got to make the decision.
Asparagus tips.
Hey what are you doing in the woods?
Walkin', thinkin'.
About me?
You changin' your mind about me?
Jesus no.
Better not you bastard.
Well what is it?
My head, you broke it.
Well what'll I do?
Can't think, help me.
I will don't worry.
I'll take care.
Ahh...
You're hurtin' me.
Sorry.
There you are, that should do it.
That better?
I guess.
Good.
All right.
Does it show.
Uh...
Well, I'll slip you into your overall outfit with a cap.
And uh, nobody will be able to tell a thing.
Hey Fats?
Yeah.
I've been doin' some thinking.
Yeah.
What would you say if I uh... if I called the police and told?
You ain't being logical.
Look, Gangrene was taken care of because he was going to have you put away.
If you tell the cops, they'll have you put away.
Well what'll we do with him?
Bring me any identification he's got on him.
Why?
Time for a little dip.
After dinner get yourself some stones and stuff 'em in his pockets.
But I'm not that strong a swimmer.
Just dog paddle out to the middle and drop him down.
I know this lake.
There's snapping turtles out there.
Everybody said that.
Once there was a water moccasin scare.
I don't care if the Loch Ness monster's out there, and he's ravenous.
Do it beautifully.
Hello?
Good morning.
Coffee's on.
Coffee's ready.
Good.
Careful.
Uh, Duke got home very late last night.
He didn't much like the idea of me being here alone with a man.
He's watching us now.
Uh, do you think it's wise for me to come up there now?
I think he wants to watch us together.
Oh.
Give me five minutes.
Hey.
Has he got a telescope?
Because if he doesn't,
I'd like to say that going to bed with you is maybe the best three things that ever happened to me.
And I'd love some coffee.
And I adore you.
And I take it with cream and sugar.
And your breasts belong in the Louvre, which is a museum in Paris that I plan on visiting with you once you get wise and decide to leave the old ear blower.
Are you ever somethin'.
Hello?
We're in the kitchen.
Hi Duke.
How are you?
Come on in, sit down.
Yeah, thanks.
Doing okay.
You take your coffee how?
Everything.
Sorry I wasn't here to greet you.
Help with the entertaining and all.
But somebody's got to earn a living.
You're still in real estate right?
No, I gave that up.
It was dull.
What I really like is the out a doors.
Go fishing, hunting.
That probably seems dull to someone like you.
No, not at all.
Fine, thanks.
And I do a little selling' nowadays.
Sundries, like that.
I'm surprised Peg here didn't bring you up to date.
Well she may have.
The truth is, once I start drinking wine, you can forget about me.
Hey Duke, that stuff you sell?
You don't happen to have a penis do you?
My last one caught Dutch Elm Disease and it's murder getting an erection.
God damn, that's clever.
Don't tell schmucko.
Tell me.
'Cause I'm the talent.
Shhh...
Do you travel a lot in your work?
How do you do that?
I mean that's terrific.
I'm really glad you're here for me to see this.
Are you going to be good?
I mean it.
You promise?
Okay.
Ask him if he's glad I'm here too?
Yeah, the both of you.
Thank you.
How long are you going to be?
Quick as I can.
As long as it takes me to board up those far cabins.
Don't stay out too long.
You'll get soaked.
How'd I do.
Just unbelievable.
Too bad Fats wasn't here.
He might of been a little help.
Gotten a couple of laughs.
You're always unbelievable.
Oh, brains as well as boobs.
Corky, do you drive a Rolls?
No.
Well there's somebody's white Rolls parked down there.
Shit.
It's gotta be Gangrene's.
Why would he leave it though.
Who's is it?
My agent.
He's rich as hell.
But still you just don't leave an $80,000 car and walk away.
He must have come looking for me.
Looking for you?
Yeah.
He's left the keys.
Yeah, look if I level with you, you won't let this get around?
I'm in hiding.
A lot of career problems.
I haven't been behaving all that normal.
Well can you find out what's happened to him.
This cars been here a couple of hours.
Yeah, I'll sure as hell try.
Hey, would you mind getting it unstuck?
Me driving an $80,000 car,
I'd mind that a lot.
Sadie?
Sadie?
It's me.
Is he in?
Please.
Don't yell at me Goddamn it.
I'm sick of hearing about my erratic behavior.
How the hell did you ever find me.
I tipped that bastard cabbie so he wouldn't tell.
We were on a long walk is why you didn't find anybody.
Never mind who the we is, finish about the car.
Ha, ha.
I'd love to have seen that.
You hitchhiking a ride to Grossinger's.
Why didn't you have 'em come and un-stick the car.
Quit yelling.
I should a known, nobody touches your Rolls but a Rolls man.
Sorry.
Duke's on his way.
Yes sir.
That was the we.
Yes sir, a lot.
It's not ridiculous.
We grew up together.
Yes she's married.
But I think she's leaving him for me.
The marriage was over.
I'm not talking about puppy love Ben.
I'm talking about salvation.
Some fish.
Some fish he takes me for.
Your old pal I'm talking about.
I suspected.
His story's so full a holes.
Why do you keep repeating that?
So a car is here, who care?
Besides, Corky agrees with you.
It's a crazy story, but there it is.
Some happy coincidence.
A guy drives 90 miles and you and Corky just happen to be off in the woods when he's snooping'.
You put out for him in the woods did ya?
I love it when you're drinking.
Well why didn't you tell me about this Goddamn legendary walk before?
No comment.
Listen,
I know his story's bullshit because I got the car out of the mud and it was nothing.
If I can do it, anybody can.
Maybe he tried.
Maybe he couldn't.
He's old.
Corky never said he was old.
He must of to me.
When?
When we were having dinner, probably.
He got squiffed fast and flaked out.
That's what he said earlier.
And how did you know he was old, did you see him?
Answer me, I'm talking to you!
No, I didn't see him.
Why not?
He must've wrung the bell.
I mean the guy drives 90 miles, he's gonna ring the Goddamn doorbell, wouldn't you agree?
I didn't hear any bell.
Now quit this.
Why not?
What were you doin' that was so...
Did he ring while you were screwing', is that it?
That is it isn't it?
No it isn't.
Why didn't you invite him in to watch?
Shut your dirty mouth.
Did you screw Corky?
No!
I'll pound you all day, you keep lying!
I'm not lying!
The truth, the goddamn truth!
Did you fuck him?
No I didn't!
But I wanted to.
Come on, it'll be fun.
If you don't like fishin'
I'll let you row.
Just had a good talk with Peg.
Like to have one with you now.
I'll grab a jacket.
Where is Peg?
She's in town making a decision, she said.
Oh.
What are you doin' that for?
Uh, habit.
Hey, we trust each other don't we?
Of course.
You seem upset.
Should I be?
Get in the front.
What are you lookin' for?
Nothin'.
You're the one wants to fish.
Why don't you try over there.
Here I'll do the rowing.
I know the best holes.
When I get us there you can take over.
I'm not much on booze.
I told you that.
You told me a lot of things.
What's that supposed to mean?
Peg said you screwed her last night.
Damn.
I told her to keep it a secret.
You think it's funny do you?
Is that why you brought me out here?
Try to get me to admit to something that never happened?
If it is I'd like to go back in now Duke.
What she said was, she wanted to go to bed with you.
I'm loosin' her Corky,
And I don't know what to do.
All she does is talk about you Duke.
You're not losing anybody.
What I said before, about quitting the real estate business, there was never any real estate business to quit.
She came in when I was on top.
And she stuck with me all the way down.
Goddamn it.
Oh, that's heavy.
Duke, I said I'd like to go back in now.
This feels like a whale.
God, I'm cold, let's get the hell in.
It's comin' loose.
Hey you're breakin' my pole.
I'm trying to help you, that's all.
Well don't help.
It's comin' now.
It's comin'.
Goddamn log.
Any of that scotch left?
Thought you didn't like booze?
I'm freezing my nuts off, that's all.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I wonder who he is.
See what his wallet says.
Jesus Christ,
I was thinking' he might be your Rolls Royce guy.
Gangrene?
You must be kidding' me.
He's about 6'3".
Nothin'.
He's stripped clean.
It doesn't make sense.
Must be some identification.
Jesus Christ, he might still be alive.
Fantastic.
I'll do the kiss of life.
You run up to the house, call Normandy Hospital.
Tell 'em to get over.
Right.
And stay at the house 'til they get there so you can direct 'em straight here.
Gotcha.
Ben Greene.
Gangrene.
Son of a bitch.
He is the Rolls guy.
Oh.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Don't panic.
My God, what have you done!
I said don't panic.
My God, what am I going to do?
Well pick me up dumb dumb and I'll tell ya.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Well sit down then dummy.
Alright.
You're gonna zoom to my suitcase and whip out one of those nice long pieces of canvas.
Well clean my face and you won't throw up.
Okay.
You're gonna take the canvas and you're gonna wrap part around Duke here, and part of it around Gangrene.
Then you're gonna get a nice big rock and wrap the rest around it.
Take that out a my mouth.
Then you're gonna row out and dump the bundle over the side.
And if you do it right,
I'll be able to say atta boy schmucko.
Two birds with one stone.
Hi.
Hi.
You've had quite a day I guess.
Whatever.
Where's Duke.
We had a blow out.
He tried to get me to admit we'd gone to bed together.
But uh... when he couldn't he told me he was going to go hunting and I should get the hell out by the time he got back.
Are you coming with me?
Are you coming with me?
I gotta know.
Who wins, me or Duke?
If I'm a prize, then you're the winner.
And as soon as Duke gets back and I can tell him in person that I'm leaving, we can take off.
Gee you know I, I...
I don't think you should put yourself through a big emotional scene like that, do you?
Well, I gotta leave Duke with his pride.
We spent a lotta years together and uh... he's gotta understand that he didn't fail.
We failed together.
So let's the both of us pack okay.
Don't try arguing me out of this.
He's got to be home soon.
He can't hunt at night time right?
Okay.
Oh, my God.
She's leaving Duke for you.
Fan-fucking-gradly, fan-fucking-tastic.
Thank you sports fans.
Well where are we off to?
Now don't get emotional about this.
About what, about what?
I think maybe there's just going to be two of us on the honeymoon.
What's the punch line?
You're gonna leave me behind?
Come on buddy, quit the kiddin'.
My head's on straight on now.
I want to get to know her, that's all.
Take her places.
Show her things.
Paris, maybe, like that.
The Eiffel Tower.
The Louvre.
You know?
Schmucko, you've never been to Paris.
What's this show her routine?
I'll be good.
You'll see.
I wanna see Paris too.
You want me to come crawling?
You want me to beg?
Okay, this is me, Fats, and I'm beggin'.
It's not easy for me either.
It is.
It is easy.
You wont be alone.
I'll tell.
What will you tell?
Everything.
I will.
I swear.
In the middle of the act, one night, when you don't expect it.
I'll scream, there's bodies in Lake Melody.
I don't see that happening.
I'm doing a single now.
Duke?
Duke?
How'd it go?
Duke understand.
We haven't talked yet.
You mean he isn't back yet.
Christ Peg.
Got kinda scary up there.
And I wanted a drink, but I didn't much wanna drink alone.
Well let's just go.
Let's get the hell out.
Send him a telegram.
I'm sorry, my mind's made up.
Besides, he can't be much longer.
You don't know that.
He was drinking heavy when he left here.
Did he take a flashlight with him?
Did you notice?
All I noticed was that big Goddamn elephant gun he was carrying when he hinted I vacate the premises.
Come on, it's stupid waiting around.
Then I'm stupid.
I didn't say you were stupid.
I said waiting was.
I'm aware of your opinion on the subject.
Well try agreeing with me for once.
Instead of being stubborn.
Give it a rest Cork.
Aaah...
Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you.
Fasten your seatbelts everybody.
It's going to be a bumpy night.
I'm here to save you two from yourselves.
Want me to do something dazzling.
You do magic too?
Corky does magic.
I only do tricks.
Hey I got just the thing Peg.
Bring me a couple a decks of cards and I'll read your mind.
What do you mean?
I'll pull the same card from your deck that you pull from mine.
That's not a trick.
You can't do that.
Sure.
You just peek at the bottom card after shuffling and it's easy as apple pie.
Corky makes a big deal production number out of it sometimes.
Like when he's got some bimbo stewardess he wants to screw.
He makes him think their minds have touched.
Never fails.
You'll never know how many people want to believe in magic.
Oh shit.
Peg.
Peg please.
Please, please come...
Were you laughing every second.
Please, please.
Was I funny you bastard son of a bitch?
Oh...
Let me explain.
Hey, hey.
Jesus.
Listen to me you schmuck.
You gotta please just answer me one small question?
Why'd you think I blew the whistle?
Ah, because I was leaving.
Because you were jealous.
Wrong schmucko.
I did it because I could.
See?
Why didn't you stop me?
Answer, you didn't because you couldn't.
Look at him.
He still doesn't understand.
Better sit down kid while I hit you with an explanation.
Ever since we got together,
I laid low.
It was best for the act.
I let you share the limelight.
If there's one thing about me, I'm big.
But then earlier today, when I begged ya, pleaded not to be left behind and you pissed ice water all over me, well, that tore it.
If I'm boring you, please walk around.
I don't care.
Fats don't start in on me.
Please don't.
Listen, I took a failure.
With the charm of Tricky Dickey Nixon.
I made us skyrocket.
It's not gonna be you and her, it's gonna stay you and me.
Except from now on even that's changed.
It's me and you.
You said I've got a weak stomach.
You look tired.
I'm not.
Then what are you yawning for?
I'm not yawning.
You gotta wake you up.
Crawl around.
That should help.
You think?
Hey yeah, it does help.
Say thank you Fats.
Thanks.
Thanks Fats.
With feeling, like I'm doing.
I'm filled with greatest fucking joy.
Gee you've got talent after all.
Let's see what else you can do.
Fats says smile.
Fats says frown.
Fats says touch the ceiling.
Fats says spin around.
Fats says get a knife.
What?
Get a knife.
Come on.
From my suitcase.
Yeah.
I know where it is.
I wonder what we could do with it?
Hey, I could whittle something.
I'm good at that, and fast too, name it.
No.
I'm looking for something with a little more pizzazz.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't do it.
You really love old Peg don't ya?
Oh please, don't kill her.
Schmucko easy.
I wouldn't dream of depriving you of that pleasure.
No, I can't do it!
There's that old bug-a-boo of yours again.
lack of confidence.
I won't and you can't make me!
Wow, I really stepped on a corn that time.
If I can't make ya, I can't make ya.
How's your head Cork?
Fine!
Thought you might be getting' a migraine.
No!
Shows how wrong you can be.
Open those baby blues.
Looks to me like one of those gut wrenchers.
It's getting bad fast.
Please!
Drilling right into the brain is it?
Surprise.
Came fast.
It can go fast.
Yeah.
Oh yes.
Not so deep anymore?
No, not so deep.
It'll all be gone soon.
Uh...
Thanks Fats.
Want it a hundred times worse, and a hundred days long?
No.
Then take the knife on up the hill lover.
And kiss the girl goodbye.
Duke?
I left schmucko down at the cabin.
Open up huh?
You and me gotta have a quick palaver.
Corky there's nothin' to say.
I told ya, he's at the cabin.
You and me are the only ones can straighten this out.
Go away Cork.
Fats.
All right, go away Fats.
That's better.
At least we know who we are now.
Hey, I've got a present that'll make you smile.
Promise it will.
He made it for you Peg.
For you to remember him by.
See, he's leaving now and he wants you to have this.
Have what?
A wooden heart.
He whittled it for you before he sent me up.
He's quick with his hands.
Leave it outside the door.
Take his heart Peg.
So he'll know you don't feel contempt for him.
Oh, I never felt that.
At least that's something.
I'll leave it by the door.
Bye.
Wait a minute, you didn't leave.
Brains as well as boobs.
Anytime you feel like playing with my levers you'll call?
Sure, sure.
Peggy Ann Snow,
Peggy Ann Snow, please let me follow wherever you go.
She liked my heart.
She smiled when she picked it up.
She looked so pleased and everything.
I made her happy.
Me?
No tricks or anything.
What's wrong.
I don't know how to say this, since I haven't got a stomach, but my stomach hurts.
Bad?
Gettin' bad.
Gettin' real bad.
Yeah.
What's goin' on?
We're dying I think is what it is?
Dyin'?
Yeah,
I put the knife deep in me.
Christ it's spreadin'.
Yeah.
Don't leave me here alone.
Don't worry.
Can you get over here.
I'll try.
Put me flat.
Here.
Why didn't you leave?
Go with her when you had the chance?
She'd never of gone with me.
She'd have turned me down.
I couldn't even get her to open the door by myself.
It was never me.
Always us.
Schmucko.
Us was you.
What?
It was you all the time.
I hope I don't die first is all.
I think we'll go together.
Chances are.
Hey Cork?
Hey it's me.
I changed my mind.
Let's give it a whack okay?
See how it goes?
What do ya say.
I'm warning you Cork, don't play hard to get with me.
'Cause I'm a woman see, and I can always change my mind again.
You may not get this oppor-fuckin'-tunity tomorrow.
Did you knock 'em dead, Corky?
I did everything right.
You mean it went perfect?
You're first time on your own.
Me not there to see.
Don't make it more than it was.
Now don't give me that inferiority crap.
Now, did the lift go okay?
I never did it better.
Open.
Now, when you're rich and famous, don't you forget me.
I'll never forget you.
Open...
There are not three guys alive that can do what you can with those cards.
I'm tellin' ya, kid, you're as good as the game.
Sure, sure, sure.
Another Houdini.
Where you scared?
I sure was when I started.
Well, I wasn't calm.
But then,
I wasn't all that worried.
I figured I'd uh...
Done all the practicing I could so what the hell.
Were you the only magician?
Yes, sir.
The men all wanted to be Bob Dylan and the girls did mostly Barbara Walters imitations or sang Dolly Parton songs.
Some of them panicked before they got up to perform.
Not you though?
No, not me.
See, the guy who was in charge of everything ran things so well.
He had one of those hourglass egg timers and when he turned it over you started, and when the sand was finished so were you.
Good evening.
(audience talking and laughing)
Tell me, kid, did you begin with some flourishes?
Yeah.
You always taught me that they were the best attention grabbers.
Was I, was I right?
It was amazing.
Everybody quick shut up and watched.
No more whispering.
Nothing.
And once you had 'em Corky, then what did you do?
Well, I quick told this pudgy lady at the ringside to please pick any card she wanted as long as it was the big casino, the ten of diamonds.
Okay, would you please show the card to the audience?
And I forced it on her perfectly.
Everybody loved it a lot and laughed.
And then I went straight into rising aces.
Did the lift work great?
Yes, sir.
The sand was really running out of that hourglass.
And I told myself to forget it and just concentrate on the moves.
So, I took my time and made it work and everybody applauded like crazy.
(audience talking and laughing)
So I just took a couple of bows and I got oft
Oh, kid, don't bullshit me.
I really did do everything right.
Really.
Only nobody much cared.
And?
And?
Go on.
I guess I just cracked.
"You stupid sons of bitches, " I said,
"Don't you know how hard that was?"
"That's a thousand hours of my life you just saw. "
They don't care from heart, kid.
They just want to be entertained.
I guess I didn't do you proud all in all.
But did you talk to the people?
Did you use your charm?
I can't, and you know that.
Corky, you want to be as good as the game?
Don't you?
You know I do.
Then you better find yourself some charm, kid.
How?
You'll think of something.
(crowd clamoring)
Hey man, why don't you--
Hi, I'm George Todson, NBC.
I'm to meet Mr. Ben Greene.
Oh, yes sir.
He's right inside.
Thank you.
Say my man, how come he jumps ahead of us?
I guess this boy Withers is your latest sensation, hmm?
How are ya, sit down.
Jesus, you booked him into a very classy spot, Ben.
And I found him here.
You know, it's not easy getting him to move.
You want a beer?
it's safe.
Sure.
He likes this place?
Well, he bombed here his first time out, you know?
But he didn't get-- Hey, get him a beer, garcon.
Sure, Budweiser?
But he didn't give up.
He just worked his ass off for a year.
He come back and he hit it big.
There's never been a magician like him.
You dragged me down here for a magician?
Come on, Ben.
I run a goddamn network.
We can't book those guys on kiddy shows anymore.
Now listen, your old man got his start working for me you little fart.
Don't tell me what bombs.
Magic is misdirection.
That's all it is.
And misdirection is getting the people to look in the wrong place at the right times.
So?
So naturally, magic has had a little trouble on the tube.
Why?
Because you can't misdirect the goddamn camera.
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome for Mr. Corky Withers.
(audience applauds)
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ordinary deck of cards.
Loaded with stage presence.
I can't decide, does he remind me more of Errol Flynn or Valentino?
Thank you.
Young lady, would you please pick any card you want?
As long as it's the big casino, ten of diamonds?
Will you show the audience please?
Dynamite opening, Ben.
Does he actually get better?
That's hard to believe.
Well he got a little nervous on account he knows we're here.
My teacher was a great man.
His name was Merlin, and uh...
No, seriously his name was Merlin, Jr., and this is his version of the rising aces.
And here were are, here are the four aces.
One, two, three, four.
I'm going to place them back on top of the deck.
And would you please pick any card?
Just pick any card.
Good.
Look at the card, remember it, and cover the aces.
Thank you.
All right uh...
I'm sorry, I did that wrong.
You're not supposed to cover the aces in this trick.
Um, I'm sorry.
One sec.
He's gonna pull a five card left.
Watch him, just watch him, will ya?
Goddamn drunks.
He's not Iiftin' just the top card.
He's gonna grab five.
Sir, if you think you can do better, you're welcome to try.
Just gimme a hand getting up there, schmucko.
And step aside.
Okay, you're on.
Okay.
What's going on?
Thank you.
You really think you're that good do you?
L'II guaran-fuckin'-tee ya I am.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ohh!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ahh...
You ruined the rising aces.
So what, screw it.
You see the broad with the big jugs?
You mean the ah, young lady in the feathers?
Yeah, I see her so what?
Wonder if she'd like a roll in the shavings with me?
I don't think you're very funny.
Well they do.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A nice gimmick, the dummy.
What's his name?
Fats.
Don't encourage him.
I will now change a diamond into a heart.
I guess the reason I'm such a great lover is um--
I don't want to hear about your sex life if you don't mind.
Tell us all about yours then.
Everybody likes short stories.
Shh, Don't encourage him.
Please, ladies and gentlemen.
That's really a clever shtick.
Thank you.
All right, pick a diamond.
Huh?
I said pick a diamond.
All right.
It can change into a heart while I'm holding it.
Well, go on, show the audience.
If you're so great, changeit while I'm holding it.
You won't give it back to me?
Well, that's another trick you've ruined.
Let's see,
I'll just have to think of something else.
You mean you're not gonna change my diamond into a...
Jesus Christ.
What?
It turned into a heart while I was holding it.
How'd he do that?
How'd he do that?
How did he do it?
How many times do I have to tell you.
Do you want to get out of here alive?
The kids good, I'll give him that.
Sure he's good.
I got me maybe the best magician in 50 years.
Team'd with the first x-rated dummy on the block.
Eat your heart out.
You say he really bombed here first time?
Yes.
Of course he didn't have the dummy with him then.
The dummy helps.
No question.
Right.
Local talent?
No.
He was brought up near Grossinger's in the Catskills.
I think his old man was a Iimey.
Came here to work in a health club and gave massages.
Somethin' like that.
(knock on the door) It's me.
Shit, It's old Gangrene.
Gangrene.
(laughing)
That's funny.
Quick intro.
Corky, our visitor from New York, George Todson.
How do you do, sir?
You have a lot of potential.
Hey, what about me?
You're terrific too, Fats.
Thanks, Mr. Wigston,
I mean Tubeston.
- Todson.
- Todson.
(laughing)
Now that's what I call funny.
Hey, you'll strain your pacemaker.
Behave yourself.
Come here a second, will ya?
Ah, by the way, how did you change the diamond to the heart?
I'm the misdirection dummy.
While we're bullshitting', you could bring an elephant on to the stage.
Which is why this magician will not bomb on the tube.
Why?
Because the goddamn camera watches their faces and not Corky's hands.
So you live and you learn.
- See ya.
- Bye.
Yeah, all right.
How'd it go?
Sen-fuckin'-sational.
See I'm catchin'.
What happens next?
Well, we reel 'em in slow.
The same kind of low key build up we gave Steve Martin last year.
I'm not lettin' you near New York, till we're close to making a deal.
So I just stay here?
No, first, I'd like to book you in a small lounge in Vegas for the experience.
Then the area talk shows.
You know, Tom Snyder, Mike Douglas.
All leading to Carson.
And if he asks you to come back,
I think he will, that should do it.
So, you keep motor mouth here in line, while I work on them droolers at the network.
It should take five, maybe six months.
Now, when I buy you a free lunch at the Four Seasons in New York, you'll know you're home free.
Sound okay?
Yes, sir.
You're a good kid, Corky.
Hey, you know what I think?
No, what do you think?
We're gonna be a star.
(city noise)
Zachary!
Seems like I'm breaking the law.
I'll see that no one touches it, sir.
No one must ever touch a Rolls, but a Rolls man.
Yes, sir.
Margo, will you show this gentleman to Mr. Greene's table please?
Hi.
Hi.
Is everything all right?
They want me?
The uh, network people I mean.
May I?
Yeah, thank you.
Have a cigar for later, Corky.
Take two, they're are big.
I invented conspicuous consumption.
Don't you forget that.
If you're trying to get my attention you got it.
Will you do me a favor kid?
Will you try not to turn shit heel?
It's almost an automatic once a guy makes it big.
I'd love to see you beat the odds.
Maybe I won't make it big.
Come on, tell me.
What is it?
Two years ago, you couldn't get arrested.
Two years from now you are going to have it all.
Corky, NBC wants a pilot special.
What's that?
What's that, it's what they gave Rich Little a while back.
Menu, sir?
Ah, you see, when they're hot for somebody like they're hot for you, they make a contract which hinges on the first show.
And if it hits, you're off and running for a bunch more.
Terrific.
That's why they call me the Postman,
I always deliver.
Is it set and, everything?
It's set but it's not set, set.
There's agent stuff like who pays how much for publicity, how much for the guest stars.
You'll have to take a medical exam and stuff like that.
Now what's wrong?
Um...
I don't think I'm going to take the medical exam.
Any particular reason?
Principle.
What the hell does that mean, principle?
Do you remember that first night when you came backstage at the uh, Stardust and you said, you wouldn't mind representing me?
Do you remember what I said?
You're goddamn right.
You said that I could represent you but you didn't want to sign.
That was principle too.
Because if we're happy with each other, our word should be enough.
To hell with signing some piece of paper.
Why is this with the medical exam principle?
Because they're saying something wrong with me.
And I say I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I don't need any doctors poking around inside me, that's all.
Are you serious about this?
I mean, is this a deal breaker?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Sadie, Sadie.
I have to put you on hold.
Sadie, what's the first rule for being an agent?
Never forget an act that killed Lincoln.
Head of the class.
Get me Bernstein in Legal.
Corky has turned impossible.
I don't believe it.
Well, I should have been a cesspool cleaner like my mama wanted.
Corky's so cheap, last night he sent his girlfriend out to hustle.
It's not true, not true.
Just ignore him.
When she came back this morning, he asked how much she'd gotten and she said
"Sixteen dollars and ten cents."
Corky said "Ten cents?
My God, who gave you ten cents?"
And she said "Everybody."
Dammit.
Everybody, she said,
Body,body,body.
Dody, dudy, duny.
And she said-- And she said--
And she said everybody.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
I've been having meetings for hours.
I couldn't budge 'em, Cork.
Ithoughtyou said they wanted me?
Well they do Cork, but--
Didn't you explain about the principle?
Now kid, this is network policy.
It's legal policy.
Now I'm sitting here with three of our genius lawyers, my God, their IQ's alone must total up to 100.
Now we have called NBC a dozen times and they are not,
I repeat not about to spend a half a million bucks only to find out on taping day that there's some kinda health problem.
There's no problem!
Corky!
Make 'em understand.
(hangs up phone)
Well...
Shoo, will you, fellas.
Let me handle this alone.
Yep, right.
Good luck, Ben.
(phone ringing)
Yeah.
Now kid, I don't have to ask you what the trouble is.
'Cause I know what the trouble is.
I've told you once before.
It's just success, kid.
Please believe me.
You want success but you're afraid of it.
Now that happens to everybody at this stage.
I'm not afraid.
Now you stay right there.
and I 'll be right over and we'll talk it through.
I'm not afraid.
Hang tight, kid.
I'm on my way.
I won't be here!
(ominous music)
We should hit Grossinger's inside another 20 minutes.
Never mind that.
Take your next left.
Here.
Keep going into town.
Your place?
I was brought up here.
Must remember it being a whole lot bigger, huh?
No.
Want to look around?
No point.
Family all gone, huh?
Yeah.
Ah, you're lucky.
I live with four brothers, all assholes.
I don't want to come on like some ghoul, but...
Do you got people in there?
People?
Just family.
You look a lot like yourself, you know that?
Yeah, I caught you on the Carson Show a couple times.
You must make a ton for that, huh?
How'd you luck into that?
You know, see, I sing great.
I know they'd cream over me.
My agent, William Morris, arranged it.
Is this Morris guy a personal friend of Carson's?
Is that how that works?
William Morris is the name of a agency, not a guy.
Oh.
Hold it, right here.
Pull over to your left.
Fine.
Hey, this is Lake Melody, ain't it?
I'll be right back.
(door bell)
Anybody?
Anybody home?
What do you want?
A cabin.
We 're kinda closed.
Something above the lake is what I'm after.
It's just the kind of place I'm looking for.
I won't be disturbed here.
That's for sure.
But like I said, we 're kinda closed.
$50 bucks a night.
In advance.
We just re-opened.
If you don't want me waitin'?
How you gonna get to Grossinger's?
I'll call a local cab when I need one.
How much?
$80 bucks, not countin' tip.
Okay.
Ah...
Here's a hundred for the driving, and another hundred, for a favor.
Name it.
You didn't bring me here, okay?
Okay.
Good.
Thanks.
What you see is what you get.
The um, the bedroom's back there and the kitchenette and the bathroom across.
Fine.
Here's your key.
Help!
Help!
Calling all schmucko's.
Save me.
Hi.
Hi.
Jesus Christ.
This is Grossinger's?
I wonder if her ass is on ball bearings.
Shut up.
Oh, sounds like I stepped on a corn.
Sorry.
No, it's just that I carried her picture all these years.
And she didn't remember me.
Awe.
He didn't remember me.
Hello ?
Sorry to bother you.
Oh, that's all right.
No soap.
I didn't think you'd like it.
You leaving now?
No, I didn't mean no soap that way.
I meant there wasn't any soap, or towels either.
Oh, come on in here and grab one.
Oh, oh my God, you brought Fats.
You thought Peg didn't remember.
Awe.
You knew who I was too?
Yeah.
Well, why didn't you two at least grunt at each other?
He's just as cute as he is on the tube?
Cute?
Virile, yes.
Sexy,yes.
Ronald Reagan is cute.
Oh please, could I hold him, I'll be careful.
Oh, he's heavy.
Husky you bimbo.
His lips didn't move.
That's because you're not stroking my levers sweetheart.
Right in there.
Oh, she goosed me.
Ignore him, go right ahead.
Okay.
There.
And there.
I see.
(moaning)
I love it.
Hey, she hugged me to her bosom.
Isuspectshe found me irresistible.
Don't we all?
She asked you over for dinner, huh?
How long are you going to stay?
I don't know, why?
If you stayed late, that might mean you was getting hugged to her bosom too which just might make old Fats jealous and we wouldn't want that, would we now?
Hmm?
You never really told, why you were here.
Hiding.
Gotta get my head on straight.
My agent, he looks like the Ancient Mariner in that poem we hated in high school.
He's negotiating for a shot for me to maybe make it big.
We argued.
But I thought it was just principle.
The truth is probably I'm scared of success.
That's all.
You always were this weirdly timid person, Cork.
That's for sure.
Your folks still run this place?
No, they took a motel in Florida.
Gave this place to me.
But I just couldn't make a go of it.
Too bad.
The Catskills are dying and that's the truth.
Me and Duke are lookin' to sell.
God, you're beautiful.
Don't I wish.
I had such a crush on you.
No one ever accused you of having good taste, Cork.
When I moved away I whittled you a present, a wooden heart.
You never gave it to me though.
I lost it before I got it finished.
I knew you had a crush on me.
I was always pretty for you.
I didn't say pretty.
You didn't pick up on my Duke mention either.
After all, he is my consort.
My spouse.
I'm very big on enlarging my vocabulary.
Are you very big on Duke?
We seem to separate what seems like, every full moon, it hasn't been your everyday Walt Disney type marriage.
Where is he?
Quick business trip.
I'm sorry.
Tell me, does he...
Does he still look like James Dean?
Hey.
Hey.
Hearty burgundy.
Very medicinal.
Peg?
Admit it, now I'm beautiful.
How was the orgy?
Did you score?
The high point of the evening was when I reduced her to tears.
That-a-boy, schmucko.
Hey, when are we movin' on?
Tomorrow.
The day after.
Soon.
Peggy Ann Snow, Peggy Ann Snow, please let me follow, where ever you go.
Why'd you close the door?
I'm contemplating taking a piss, do you mind?
Ooh, fancy-yancy.
Hey stick your head out here one sec.
Was you thinkin' about her?
...Stuff like that.
So how long did you work with this Merlin guy?
Ah, I worked for him...years.
But uh, he taught me everything.
But I never performed.
Never like...never on my own.
Why not?
Probably afraid I'd fail.
Dope.
It wasn't 'til the week he took really sick.
And uh, he begged me that I got the guts to try.
Did you bring any tricks up with you?
No.
I don't do tricks.
Tricks means something set up beforehand.
A box with a fake lid.
A stacked deck of cards.
I don't do that.
Will you just use whatever's available?
Yeah.
Ah.
Here.
Amaze me.
A stone?
Oh, come on, will ya.
Well that was available.
- Oh, do it again.
Do it again.
- Do what again?
Oh, come on.
Okay.
You bastard.
You bastard.
I really love magic.
No magic, it's just skill.
All explainable.
I don't think I want to believe that.
Can you explain everything?
Pretty much.
What can't you explain?
Look, I don't want to get into this.
Magic's just to entertain.
You're not supposed to take it seriously.
What can't you explain?
Merlin, his wife was his assistant before me.
They were close.
They really cared.
Those last days in the hospital with her he claimed he could read her mind.
You believe that don't you?
I don't know.
I want to, I guess.
See in their act, they used to do a lot of phony telepathy crap.
Mostly cards.
Then at the end they both wanted to do it for real.
To prove to each other how much they cared, is how he put it.
Do you know the exact procedures they did and everything?
Sure.
Look, I don't want to get into this.
Oh, it'll be fun.
Come on.
I'd fail.
So what.
I don't want you thinkin' bad of me let's say.
Okay.
Forget the whole thing.
I'm trying to get away from pressure, please.
So who's putting you under pressure?
Not me.
Just thought it might be a kick.
But it's forgotten.
Now we've each shuffled a deck, okay?
Now you take mine.
So...
Just spread your cards like this.
Fine.
Okay.
Now take one card, any card.
Look at it.
And remember it.
Now what?
Now come on, you must really look at it.
I'm looking, I'm looking, don't be mad.
Okay.
Just concentrate on that one card.
Now, gather your cards up.
Place the card back face down.
Good.
Just cut the cards once.
Just take my deck.
Look for your card.
When you find it, take it out.
Tell me when you've found it.
Okay.
Okay?
What happens now?
What happened with Merlin was uh, she put the card next to her heart.
And uh, he went through her deck kind of like this.
Ah...
What's my card?
I don't know.
You must really think hard.
Okay.
Okay, I'm thinking really hard.
Well?
I'm sorry.
Well, don't stop.
I'm concentrating my ass off.
Okay.
My God it's red isn't it?
It's red.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
I give away nothing.
Come on concentrate, just concentrate.
Hey.
Show me.
We came close, what the hell.
Sit down, Peg!
Get back down!
That was your fault.
You started out fine, but then you let me drift.
Jesus Cork, forget it.
I was in bad shape in New York, Peg, and I had to run.
Where do you go when there's no place to go?
You go home.
Except there was nothing but empty houses and old cemeteries.
And I figured I'd stop by here and ask your folks about you.
Where were you living, what city, how many kids?
Never expected to find you here.
I've loved you all my goddamn life.
I needed a piece of good news about Peggy Ann Snow.
Shuffle the goddamn cards, fast!
We're gonna do it right this time.
I just know we will, because we both want it a lot.
Give me your deck.
Take my deck.
Spread the cards.
Take your card.
Pick it out.
Look at it.
Put it back on top.
Now, cut the deck once.
Take my deck, look for your card.
When you find it, tell me.
Look at me.
Should I think now?
Yes, very hard.
I am.
You're not, I can tell by your eyes your not.
Well, I'm frightened is why.
Nothing to be afraid of.
If it goes bad.
It won't go bad, not if two people want something as much as this.
There must be nothing in your mind but your card.
Nothing in your mind but--
What?
My card.
Concentrate.
(clock ticking)
Just think, think hard.
Is it--
Please is it--
Is it the three of clubs?
The three of clubs?
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.
I'll bet they don't give service like that at Grossinger's.
Drop in again in 15 years.
Why the jokes?
I'm kind of feeling my way along.
I never fooled around before.
True.
I guess sex wasn't that big a deal in my life.
What about Duke?
Mainly, he blew in my ear a lot.
True.
I deceived him into thinking it drives me mad.
He tongues away at me and I moan a lot but-- secretly I'm making a grocery lists.
(laughing)
Oh, I can be a very crappy lady when I put my mind to it.
Come here.
Let's you and me take off.
Just us.
You don't care for Duke and you know it.
I dump Duke, and you'd leave Fats, that's your offer?
Yeah, just say the word and we'll go.
A man appears after 15 years.
Says run away with me.
A girl ought to at least be able to take a bubble bath.
Think about it, right?
Why in the hell were you so shy all those years ago, huh?
Hey, what do you say sports fans.
Nah.
What's the matter?
Getting your period?
Feeling kinda blue.
I miss the city bad.
Oh, the country grows on you.
So does fungus.
I told you once already we'd leave.
When?
When I want to, now drop it.
What's so great here?
Tell me that.
Simmer down, okay?
Okay.
Hey, how's this for a solution?
You stay around here and turn hayseed andlWlhead back to Manhattan.
I take it the silence means no?
Discussion's over.
That's all.
I want out of here!
Simmer the hell down!
- Just because--
- Watch it mister!
- Just because some--
- You've been warned!
Just because some sagging bitch of an ingenue drops her pants for you!
Shut up!
Corky, you do it so good.
You're even better than the garbage men.
(screams)
Hey Ben, how do you like it?
I think it's going to be terrific.
What's with Gangrene?
Blue Cross repossess your tongue?
Come on in, shut up.
Come on in Ben, I'll do the whole routine for you?
How the hell did you ever find me.
You're amazing.
I'll bet it was that kid cab driver.
He must've called the office and found ya.
Is that right, that's it?
Yeah, I told him I was with William Morris.
He looked like a hustler, so I gave him a hundred to shut him up.
How much did you give him to talk.
Doesn't matter.
Right, right, right, right, right.
Right, you're here, that's the main thing.
That's it, right.
Come on, grab yourself a seat.
And uh, watch.
Just remember that I haven't got this anywhere near performance level yet.
How long ya been like this kid?
Like what?
Oh my God, you don't think that was for real?
How'd you think I rehearse?
It's no good.
It's for the act for Christ sakes!
Watch now.
Ladies and Gentlemen, for your viewing pleasure.
My version of the Miser's Dream.
Was it a wet dream?
Shut up.
Imagine if you will.
When I have a wet dream all that happens is I wake up covered with sawdust.
If you don't stop interrupting
I'm going to put a contract out on you with a mafia woodpecker.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a woodpecker.
Will you be quiet?
Don't encourage him, ladies and gentlemen.
It's really a great beginning, isn't it, Ben.
Is this why you wouldn't take the medical exam?
You figured somebody'd find out?
Bullshit!
I'll take the stupid exam!
I was afraid of success like you said.
I needed to get my head on straight.
I'll take the exam, do the show, whatever you want.
What I want kid?
What I want is for you to see somebody.
Who?
Who would I see?
Quit with the games!
Quit with the yelling!
Shut up!
He should show a little grati-fuckin'-tude.
You been slaving' away, comin' up with the great new stuff.
That was blockbuster material, mister.
When I come back with Woody the Woodpecker, they'll plotz in Vegas.
That's funny.
Nothin's funny.
Not anymore.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna make a few phone calls.
Tell people you mean?
Corky, you ain't in control!
Ben, you owe me a listen don't you think?
Yeah, I was kind of out of control back in the city.
I uh...
I could feel myself starting to slip down the iceberg.
So you took off, and now you're fine?
Sure.
On account of Peg.
The local town pump, terrific knockers.
Look Fats, please.
Come on, will ya?
Sorry.
Um...
I've known her ever since high school.
I never figured I'd have a chance with her, but uh, now everything's changed.
She believes in me.
Listen, girls are for down the line, kid.
Right now, you gotta let me help you.
I know a lot of people.
Beautiful doctors.
He means headshrinkers.
He just thinks you're a fruit cake.
He doesn't, he never said that, he's on our side.
He's the villain.
Don't forget that.
Never forget that.
Hey, kid.
I'm gonna ask you to do something.
It's a little something anybody ought to be able to do.
Now if you can do it, fine.
We'll forget this whole thing.
But if you can't, we'll think about getting you to see somebody fast.
Is it a deal?
Name it.
Make Fats shut up for five minutes.
Five minutes.
I can make him shut up for five years.
Wonderful.
I feel like the village idiot, if you want to know the truth.
Can we talk or is it going to be strictly semaphore?
How long so far?
There's 30 seconds.
Gosh, that's uh...
Four and a half minutes to go.
Think I'll make it?
Don't happen to have another of those, do ya?
Thanks.
"Take two, they're big."
Remember when you said that, Ben?
A pro never forgets his good lines, kid.
How long now?
Coming up to a minute.
Do you think we'll laugh about this some day?
We might.
Make a terrific scene if you ever decide to write your autobiography.
Hey, I know what you should call it, um...
"Failing Upwards", or,
"How to Succeed in Show Business, by Outliving Everybody".
Two minutes yet?
A minute forty-five.
This is very cruel of you, you know that?
I don't mean it to be.
I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive you.
Well, that would be sad.
Time?
Lt'S uh...
Two and a half minutes to go.
I can't make it.
Well, I didn't think you could.
Hello everybody.
This is Mrs. Norman Main.
My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you.
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.
Nothing to give but blood sweat and tears.
Nothing to lose but your change.
Here he is boys.
Here he is world.
Here's Fats.
You're not Iettin' him outta here.
He's the villain, don't forget that.
Hey, I think you better sit down.
Hey kid,
I have lived through Tallulah Bankhead and the death of Vaudeville.
I don't scare easy.
But I need my chance.
Your only chance is to get help fast and that's what I'm going to see happens.
Don't, ever raise a hand to me again.
You're taking my one chance.
I'm your one chance.
He's right.
The Postman's right.
You're crazy.
I tried to stop him didn't I?
Tried, tried?
You failed.
God damn it.
Look at me.
You know it's the hatch for you.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I know that, and you know that.
But all those piss ant dolts who run the world, they hate us because we're special.
They'll put you somewhere dark and moody.
Don't talk that way, please.
Cut the migraine shit.
Don't you care about anything?
Christ, don't you care about the girl?
Peg?
I love Peg.
I hope she loves you too.
So on visiting day she can bring crayons and the two of you's can color together.
What do you want from me?
You know goddamn well what.
I don't!
Liar.
- Tell me!
- Weakling.
- I'm not, I'm not!
- Stop the Postman!
- I can't!
- Gutless fuck!
- I can't!
- Stop the Postman!
How, how with what?
Me, me, me, me, me!
(Fats screaming)
(Fats screaming)
(Fats screaming)
(Fats screaming)
(thud)
Cork?
What's up, what is it?
Oh, I meant to ask.
Do you want me unthaw the asparagus tips, or the French-cut green beans?
Either.
No fair.
You're the man you've got to make the decision.
Asparagus tips.
Hey what are you doing in the woods?
Walkin', thinkin'.
About me?
You changin' your mind about me?
Jesus no.
Better not you bastard.
(groaning)
Well, what is it?
My head, you broke it.
Well, what'll I do?
Can't think, help me.
I will don't worry.
I'll take care.
Ah.
You're hurtin' me.
Sorry.
There you are, that should do it.
That better?
I guess.
Good.
All right.
Does it show?
Well...
Well, I'll slip you into your overall outfit with a cap.
And uh, nobody will be able to tell a thing.
- Hey, Fats?
- Yeah.
- I've been doin' some thinking.
- Yeah.
What would you say if I uh...
If I called the police and told?
You ain't being logical.
Look, Gangrene was taken care of because he was going to have you put away.
If you tell the cops, they'll have you put away.
Well, what'll we do with him?
Bring me any identification he's got on him.
Why?
Time for a little dip.
After dinner get yourself some stones and stuff 'em in his pockets.
But I'm not that strong a swimmer.
Just dog paddle out to the middle and drop him down.
I know this lake.
There's snapping turtles out there.
Everybody said that.
Once there was a water moccasin scare.
I don't care if the Loch Ness monster's out there, and he's ravenous.
Do it beautifully.
(screaming)
Hello?
Good morning.
Coffee's on.
Coffee's ready.
- Good.
- Careful.
Uh, Duke got home very late last night.
He didn't much like the idea of me being here alone with a man.
He's watching us now.
Uh, do you think it's wise for me to come up there now?
I think he wants to watch us together.
Oh.
Give me five minutes.
Hey.
Has he got a telescope?
Because if he doesn't,
I'd like to say that going to bed with you is maybe the best three things that ever happened to me.
And I'd love some coffee.
And I adore you.
And I take it with cream and sugar.
And your breasts belong in the Louvre, which is a museum in Paris that I plan on visiting with you once you get wise and decide to leave the old ear blower.
Are you ever somethin'.
Hello ?
We're in the kitchen.
Hi Duke.
How are you?
Come on in, sit down.
Yeah, thanks.
Doing okay.
You take your coffee how?
Everything.
I'm sorry I wasn't here to greet you.
Help with the entertaining and all.
But somebody's got to earn a living.
You're still in real estate, right?
No, I gave that up.
It was dull.
What I really like is the out a doors.
Go fishing, hunting.
That probably seems dull to someone like you.
No, not at all.
Fine, thanks.
And I do a little selling' nowadays.
Sundries, like that.
I'm surprised Peg here didn't bring you up to date.
Well, she may have.
The truth is, once I start drinking wine, you can forget about me.
Hey Duke, that stuff you sell?
You don't happen to have a penis do you?
My last one caught Dutch Elm Disease and it's murder getting an erection.
(laughing)
God damn, that's clever.
Don't tell schmucko.
Tell me.
'Cause I'm the talent.
Shh.
(muffled scream)
Do you travel a lot in your work?
How do you do that?
I mean, that's terrific.
I'm really glad you're here for me to see this.
Are you going to be good?
I mean it.
You promise?
Okay.
Ask him if he's glad I'm here too?
Yeah, the both of you.
Thank you.
How long are you going to be?
Quick as I can.
As long as it takes me to board up those far cabins.
Don't stay out too long.
You'll get soaked.
How'd I do?
Just unbelievable.
Too bad Fats wasn't here.
He might of been a little help.
Gotten a couple of laughs.
You're always unbelievable.
Oh, brains as well as boobs.
Corky, do you drive a Rolls?
No.
Well there's somebody's white Rolls parked down there.
Shit.
It's gotta be Gangrene's.
Why would he leave it though.
Who's is it?
My agent.
He's rich as hell.
But still you just don't leave an $80,000 car and walk away.
He must have come looking for me.
Looking for you?
Yeah.
He's left the keys.
Yeah, look if I level with you, you won't let this get around?
I'm in hiding.
A lot of career problems.
I haven't been behaving all that normal.
Well, can you find out what's happened to him?
This cars been here a couple of hours.
Yeah, I'll sure as hell try.
Hey, would you mind getting it unstuck?
Me driving an $80,000 car,
I'd mind that a lot.
Sadie?
Sadie?
It's me.
Is he in?
Please.
(dial tone)
Don't yell at me Goddamn it.
I'm sick of hearing about my erratic behavior.
How the hell did you ever find me?
I tipped that bastard cabbie so he wouldn't tell.
We were on a long walk is why you didn't find anybody.
Never mind who the we is, finish about the car.
Ha, ha.
I'd love to have seen that.
You hitchhiking a ride to Grossinger's.
Why didn't you have 'em come and un-stick the car.
Quit yelling.
I should a known, nobody touches your Rolls but a Rolls man.
Sorry.
Duke's on his way.
Yes, sir.
That was the we.
Yes sir, a lot.
It's not ridiculous.
We grew up together.
Yes she's married.
But I think she's leaving him for me.
The marriage was over.
I'm not talking about puppy love, Ben.
I'm talking about salvation.
Some fish.
Some fish he takes me for.
Your old pal I'm talking about.
I suspected.
His story's so full a holes.
Why do you keep repeating that?
So a car is here, who care?
Besides, Corky agrees with you.
It's a crazy story, but there it is.
Some happy coincidence.
A guy drives 90 miles and you and Corky just happen to be off in the woods when he's snooping'.
You put out for him in the woods, did ya?
I love it when you're drinking.
Well, why didn't you tell me about this Goddamn legendary walk before?
No comment.
Listen,
I know his story's bullshit because I got the car out of the mud and it was nothing.
If I can do it, anybody can.
Maybe he tried.
Maybe he couldn't.
He's old.
Corky never said he was old.
He must of to me.
When?
When we were having dinner, probably.
He got squiffed fast and flaked out.
That's what he said earlier.
And how did you know he was old, did you see him?
Answer me, I'm talking to you!
No, I didn't see him.
Why not?
He must've wrung the bell.
I mean the guy drives 90 miles, he's gonna ring the goddamn doorbell, wouldn't you agree?
I didn't hear any bell.
Now quit this.
Why not?
What were you doin' that was so--
Did he ring while you were screwing', is that it?
That is it, isn't it?
No it isn't.
Why didn't you invite him in to watch?
Shut your dirty mouth.
Did you screw Corky?
No!
I'll pound you all day, you keep lying!
I'm not lying!
The truth, the goddamn truth!
Did you fuck him?
No I didn't!
But I wanted to.
Come on, it'll be fun.
If you don't like fishin' I'll let you row.
Just had a good talk with Peg.
Like to have one with you now.
I'll grab a jacket.
Where is Peg?
She's in town making a decision, she said.
Oh.
What are you doin' that for?
Uh, habit.
Hey, we trust each other don't we?
Of course.
You seem upset.
Should I be?
Get in the front.
What are you lookin' for?
Nothin'.
You're the one wants to fish.
Why don't you try over there.
Here I'll do the rowing.
I know the best holes.
When I get us there you can take over.
I'm not much on booze.
I told you that.
You told me a lot of things.
What's that supposed to mean?
Peg said you screwed her last night.
(laughing)
Damn.
I told her to keep it a secret.
You think it's funny, do you?
Is that why you brought me out here?
Try to get me to admit to something that never happened?
If it is I'd like to go back in now, Duke.
What she said was, she wanted to go to bed with you.
I'm loosin' her Corky, and I don't know what to do.
All she does is talk about you, Duke.
You're not losing anybody.
What I said before, about quitting the real estate business, there was never any real estate business to quit.
She came in when I was on top.
And she stuck with me all the way down.
Goddamn it.
Oh, that's heavy.
Duke, I said I'd like to go back in now.
This feels like a whale.
God, I'm cold, let's get the hell in.
It's comin' loose.
Hey, you're breakin' my pole.
I'm trying to help you, that's all.
Well, don't help.
It's comin' now.
It's comin'.
Goddamn log.
Any of that scotch left?
Thought you didn't like booze?
I'm freezing my nuts off, that's all.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I wonder who he is.
See what his wallet says.
Jesus Christ,
I was thinking' he might be your Rolls Royce guy.
Gangrene?
You must be kidding' me.
He's about 6'3...
Nothin'.
He's stripped clean.
It doesn't make sense.
Must be some identification.
Jesus Christ, he might still be alive.
Fantastic.
I'll do the kiss of life.
You run up to the house, call Normandy Hospital.
Tell 'em to get over.
Right.
And stay at the house 'til they get there so you can direct 'em straight here.
Gotcha.
(ominous music)
Ben Greene.
Gangrene.
Son-of-a-bitch.
He is the Rolls guy.
Oh.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Don't panic.
My God, what have you done!
I said don't panic.
My God, what am I going to do?
Well, pick me up dumb-dumb and I'll tell ya.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Well, sit down then, dummy.
Alright.
You're gonna zoom to my suitcase and whip out one of those nice long pieces of canvas.
Well clean my face and you won't throw up.
Okay.
You're gonna take the canvas and you're gonna wrap part around Duke here, and part of it around Gangrene.
Then you're gonna get a nice big rock and wrap the rest around it.
Take that out a my mouth.
Then you're gonna row out and dump the bundle over the side.
And if you do it right,
I'll be able to say atta-boy, schmucko.
Two birds with one stone.
Hi.
Hi.
You've had quite a day I guess.
Whatever.
Where's Duke.
We had a blow up.
He tried to get me to admit we'd gone to bed together.
But uh...
When he couldn't he told me he was going to go hunting and I should get the hell out by the time he got back.
Are you coming with me?
Are you coming with me?
I gotta know.
Who wins, me or Duke?
If I'm a prize, then you're the winner.
And as soon as Duke gets back and I can tell him in person that I'm leaving, we can take off.
Gee you know I...
I...
I don't think you should put yourself through a big emotional scene like that, do you?
Well, I gotta leave Duke with his pride.
We spent a lotta years together and ah...
He's gotta understand that he didn't fail.
We filed together.
So let's the both of us pack, okay.
Don't try arguing me out of this.
He's got to be home soon.
He can't hunt at night time, right?
Okay.
Oh, my God.
She's leaving Duke for you.
Fan-fucking-gradly, fan-fucking-tastic.
Thank you sports fans.
Well, where are we off to?
Now don't get emotional about this.
About what, about what?
I think maybe there's just going to be two of us on the honeymoon.
What's the punch line?
You're gonna leave me behind?
Come on buddy, quit the kiddin'.
My head's on straight on now.
I want to get to know her, that's all.
Take her places.
Show her things.
Paris, maybe, like that.
The Eiffel Tower.
The Louvre.
You know?
Schmucko, you've never been to Paris.
What's this "show her" routine?
I 'II be good.
You'll see.
I wanna see Paris too.
You want me to come crawling?
You want me to beg?
Okay, this is me, Fats, and I'm beggin '.
It's not easy for me either.
It is.
It is easy.
You won't be alone.
I'll tell.
What will you tell?
Everything.
I will.
I swear.
In the middle of the act, one night, when you don't expect it.
I'll scream, there's bodies in Lake Melody.
I don't see that happening.
I'm doing a single now.
(stairs creaking)
Duke?
Duke?
How'd it go?
Duke understand?
We haven't talked yet.
You mean he isn't back yet?
Christ, Peg.
Got kinda scary up there.
And I wanted a drink, but I didn't much wanna drink alone.
Well, let's just go.
Let's get the hell out.
Send him a telegram.
I'm sorry, my mind's made up.
Besides, he can't be much longer.
You don't know that.
He was drinking heavy when he left here.
Did he take a flashlight with him?
Did you notice?
All I noticed was that big goddamn elephant gun he was carrying when he hinted I vacate the premises.
Come on, it's stupid waiting around.
Then I'm stupid.
I didn't say you were stupid.
I said waiting was.
I'm aware of your opinion on the subject.
Well, try agreeing with me for once.
Instead of being stubborn.
Give it a rest, Cork.
(singing) Ah...
Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you.
Fasten your seat belts everybody.
It's going to be a bumpy night.
I'm here to save you two from yourselves.
Want me to do something dazzling?
You do magic too?
Corky does magic.
I only do tricks.
Hey, I got just the thing, Peg.
Bring me a couple a decks of cards and I'll read your mind.
What do you mean?
I'll pull the same card from your deck that you pulled from mine.
That's not a trick.
You can't do that.
Sure.
You just peek at the bottom card after shuffling and it's easy as apple pie.
Corky makes a big deal production number out of it sometimes.
Like when he's got some bimbo stewardess he wants to screw.
He makes him think their minds have touched.
Never fails.
You'll never know how many people want to believe in magic.
Oh Shit.
Peg.
Peg, please.
- Please, please come--
- Leave me alone.
Were you laughing every second.
Please, please.
Was I funny you bastard son-of-a-bitch?
Oh!
Let me explain.
Hey,hey.
Jesus.
Listen to me you schmuck.
You gotta please just answer me one small question?
Why'd you think I blew the whistle?
Ah, because I was leaving.
Because you were jealous.
Wrong, schmucko.
I did it because I could.
See?
Why didn't you stop me?
Answer, you didn't because you couldn't.
Look at him.
He still doesn't understand.
Better sit down kid while I hit you with an explanation.
Ever since we got together, I laid low.
It was best for the act.
I let you share the limelight.
If there's one thing about me, I'm big.
But then earlier today, when I begged ya, pleaded not to be left behind and you pissed ice water all over me, well, that tore it.
If I'm boring you, please walk around.
I don't care.
Fats, don't start in on me.
Please don't.
Listen, I took a failure.
With the charm of Tricky Dickey Nixon.
I made us skyrocket.
It's not gonna be you and her, it's gonna stay you and me.
Except from now on even that's changed.
It's me and you.
You said I've got a weak stomach.
- You look tired.
- I'm not.
- Then what are you yawning for?
- I'm not yawning.
You gotta wake you up.
- Crawl around.
That should help.
- You think?
Hey yeah, it does help.
Say thank you, Fats.
Thanks.
Thanks, Fats.
With feeling, like I'm doing.
I'm filled with grati-fucking-tude.
Gee, you've got talent after all.
Let's see what else you can do.
Fats says smile.
Fats says frown.
Fats says touch the ceiling.
Fats says spin around.
Fats says get a knife.
What?
Get a knife.
Come on.
From my suitcase.
Yeah.
I know where it is.
I wonder what we could do with it?
Hey, I could whittle something.
I'm good at that, and fast too, name it.
No.
I'm looking for something with a little more pizzazz.
Yeah,yeah,yeah.
Don't do it.
You really love old Peg, don't ya?
Oh please, don't kill her.
Schmucko, easy.
I wouldn't dream of depriving you of that pleasure.
No, I can't do it!
There's that old bug-a-boo of yours again.
Lack of confidence.
I won't and you can't make me!
Wow, I really stepped on a corn that time.
If I can't make ya, I can't make ya.
- How's your head, Cork?
- Fine!
Thought you might be getting' a migraine.
No!
Shows how wrong you can be.
(screaming)
Open those baby blues.
Looks to me like one of those gut wrenchers.
It's getting bad fast.
Please!
Drilling right into the brain, is it?
(moaning in pain)
Surprise.
Came fast.
It can go fast.
Yeah?
Oh yes.
Not so deep anymore?
No, not so deep.
It'll all be gone soon.
Uh...thanks, Fats.
Want it a hundred times worse, and a hundred days long?
No.
Then take the knife on up the hill, lover.
And kiss the girl goodbye.
(door rattling)
Duke?
I left schmucko down at the cabin.
Open up, huh?
You and me gotta have a quick palaver.
Corky, there's nothin' to say.
I told ya, he's at the cabin.
You and me are the only ones who can straighten this out.
Go away, Cork.
Fats.
All right, go away, Fats.
That's better.
At least we know who we are now.
Hey, I've got a present that'll make you smile.
Promise it will.
He made it for you, Peg.
For you to remember him by.
See, he's leaving now and he wants you to have this.
Have what?
A wooden heart.
He whittled it for you before he sent me up.
He's quick with his hands.
Leave it outside the door.
Take his heart, Peg.
So he'll know you don't feel contempt for him.
Oh, I never felt that.
At least that's something.
I'll leave it by the door.
Bye.
Wait a minute, you didn't leave.
Brains as well as boobs.
Anytime you feel like playing with my levers you'll call?
Sure, sure.
Peggy Ann Snow,
Peggy Ann Snow, please let me follow wherever you go...
(ominous music)
She liked my heart.
She smiled when she picked it up.
She looked so pleased and everything.
I made her happy.
Me.
No tricks or anything.
What's wrong?
I don't know how to say this, since I haven't got a stomach, but my stomach hurts.
Bad?
Gettin' bad.
Gettin' real bad.
Yeah.
What's goin' on?
We're dying I think is what it is?
Dyin'?
Yeah,
I put the knife deep in me.
Christ, it's spreadin'.
Yeah.
Don't leave me here alone.
Don't worry.
Can you get over here.
All right, I'll try.
Put me flat.
Here.
Why didn't you leave?
Go with her when you had the chance?
She'd never of gone with me.
She'd have turned me down.
I couldn't even get her to open the door by myself.
It was never me.
Always us.
Schmucko, us was you.
What?
It was you all the time.
I hope I don't die first, is all.
I think we'll go together.
Chances are.
Hey Cork?
Hey, it's me.
I...
I changed my mind.
Let's give it a whack okay?
See how it goes?
What do ya say?
I'm warning you Cork, don't play hard to get with me.
'Cause I'm a woman see, and I can always change my mind again.
You may not get this oppor-fuckin'-tunity tomorrow.

Public Address:
Attention.
Level 38 walkways will be closed for one hour.
Level 38 cardholders must report to Central immediately.
Roj.
Ah, Ravella.
Did you have any trouble?
No.
You followed the route I gave you?
Yes.
Can we get on with it please?
Come on.
You've managed to do without eating and drinking?
I've done without food or drink for thirty six hours.
- How do you feel?
- Hungry and thirsty, of course.
- Nothing else?
- Ravella, is this some kind of practical joke?
It's no joke.
Public Address:
The President will be answering questions about new population control measures.
All our food and drink is treated with suppressants.
Go without for a day and a half, they should wear off.
Not that again.
Dal Richie, Roj Blake.
Been looking forward to meeting you.
I hear your family settled on the Outer Planets?
Brother and a sister on Ziegler Five.
- Do you hear from them much?
- I get vistapes a couple of times a year
Look, what is this?
I was told you had some news about them.
No, not me.
The man we're going to meet.
He wants to tell you in person.
He was on Ziegler Five a few months ago.
Where is he now?
Waiting for us, outside.
Outside?
It's not all that bad.
The air's fresh, though it smells different.
You realise going outside is a Category Four crime?
We do know the law.
So whatever you see tonight you keep silent about.
Well?
Are you coming?
Let's get on with it.
What are you doing?
Picking the lock.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
One more thing:
If you open the door, it registers on the computer.
These are circuit integrators.
Now you could steal this entire section of wall and the machine would ignore you.
Ready?
You report anything to the authorities; you'll find yourself implicated more deeply than you imagine.
[ELECTRONIC WHIRRING]
[RUNNING WATERAND DISTANT ANIMAL NOISES]
- Try some
- Hm?
It's natural water.
The stuff we get has been recycled a thousand times and dosed with suppressants.
- I'll check ahead.
Watch for my signal.
- Okay
Improves the flavour if nothing else.
Doesn't it bother you that you spend your life in a state of drug induced tranquility?
- We've got to go across that?
- Yeah
Why should the Administration try to drug us?
To keep control.
They've been stepping up the suppressants because the number of dissidents is growing.
- They've seen what's happening and they want to stop it.
- Stop what?
Don't you know?
Don't you remember anything about the treatments they gave you?
I've had no treatments!
I thought there'd be something left, some memory.
- What about my memory?
- There's the signal
[DRONE OF DISTANT MACHINERY]
- They're Outsiders!
- Quite a few of them are working for our cause now.
It's illegal to have contact with anyone who lives outside the city!
Right, but then this whole meeting is illegal.
I'm leaving!
I want nothing to do with this.
You told me I was going to meet a man who could tell me some news about my family.
Hold on, Blake.
You've got to hear Foster.
I don't want to hear Foster!
I should report everything I've seen to the Administration.
- You can't do that
- Why not?
We've left documents in the city with your signature on them.
Forged of course, but convincing enough to implicate you in everything we've been doing.
Don't have any doubts.
One word can make you look as guilty as any of us.
And looking guilty is all it takes.
Roj!
Good to see you It's been a long time.
Bran Foster Oh!
Stupid of me.
You don't remember.
You had the treatment.
I've had no treatments, my memory is fine.
Now what is going on?
Now, now I know it's difficult for you.
It's also difficult for those of us who knew you before.
But the important thing is, you're here.
I had trouble getting out of the city.
For a while there I thought we'd been infiltrated.
- Dev Tarrant's here.
Dev!
You remember Roj Blake.
- Oh, yes.
We met before.
- I'm trying to persuade Roj to rejoin us.
- Yes.
Now, I want you to listen to what I have to tell you.
After that you can do whatever you like.
- All right.
Now what do you know about my family?
- There are other things you should know first
- Forget the other things.
- What do you know?
Your brother and sister are both dead.
I'm sorry;
I didn't intend you to hear it like that.
They were executed four years ago just after your trial.
Executed?
That's not true I hear from them regularly I had a vistape only a month ago.
Those tapes are fakes.
Part of the treatment to keep your memory suppressed.
This isn't going to be easy, but I'm going to have to tell you things about yourself.
of which you have no memory.
Will you hear me out?
Go on.
Four years ago, there was a good deal of discontent with the Administration.
There were many activist groups.
But the only one that really meant anything was led by Roj Blake.
You and I worked together.
We were outlawed and hunted.
But we had supporters and we were making progress.
Then someone betrayed us, I still don't know who.
You were captured.
So were most of our followers.
They could have killed you.
But that would have given the cause a martyr.
So instead they put you into intensive therapy.
They erased areas of your mind, they implanted new ideas.
They literally took your mind to pieces and rebuilt it.
And when they'd finished, you confessed.
You said you'd been "misguided".
You appealed to everyone to support the Administration, hound out the traitors.
They did a good job on you.
You were very convincing.
Then they took you back and erased even that.
What happened to the others?
In their benevolence, the Federation allowed them to emigrate to the Outer Worlds.
Like your family, they were executed on arrival.
Why are you telling me this now?
Because we're preparing to move again.
And if you were with us we'd get more support.
How do you feel?
Will you help us again?
- I don't know I'm not even sure that I believe you.
- It's all true.
- I have to think.
- Of course.
We'll talk after the meeting.
What do you think?
There's not much left of the man I knew.
We'll see.
All right, let's get started, shall we?
Come on everybody.
Let's start the meeting now.
You come over here and make a group.
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you for turning up.
We all know the risks that we're running in being here, so I'll be as brief as possible.
You've probably heard that the settlers in the Outer Worlds are rightly demanding greater autonomy.
If we can help to unify their voices, the Administration will have to listen.
The security forces are already overstretched.
If we step up our civil disobedience here on Earth, they will have to concentrate their forces here, giving the Outer Worlds more freedom of action.
We must aim to have at least one world declare its independence within the next two years.
Trooper Communication:
Unit three, move in.
I think most of you know my old friend, Dev Tarrant Dev will give you details of how we can all help.
We've got to cause as much disruption as possible in the food manufacturing division.
There's nothing more effective than ration cuts to cause unrest.
I've worked out methods to implement this disruption.
Do not attempt to resist arrest.
No matter what the provocation; we must not resort to violence.
We claim our rights as citizens, and demand to be treated as civil prisoners.
[GUNFIRE SCREAMING]
You're obviously suffering from a severe emotional disturbance.
We must try to unravel this fantasy.
It is NOT a fantasy.
Of course it isn't.
Do you believe me?
To you it isn't a fantasy.
Get out!
Leave me alone!
Reality is a dangerous concept.
Each one of us interprets it in a slightly different way.
Every sense impression is filtered by the brain and altered, sometimes just a little, sometimes completely, to fit our individual model of what the world is about.
If that model should be challenged.
I am NOT insane I am NOT insane.
No!
You must put that thought completely out of your mind.
You've had a shock.
Yes.
We must work together to uncover what that shock was.
I'm going to prescribe a mild sedative.
No drugs!
A mild sedative to help you to sleep.
You must rest.
No!
No drugs.
All right, no drugs.
Now try not to think anymore.
Don't worry; we'll get it sorted out.
I can't remember.
I can't remember!
Can he break through the memory blocks, Dr Havant?
It's unlikely.
We don't eradicate memory, merely make it inaccessible.
But in the normal, healthy mind the barriers are impenetrable.
Should he suffer anything like a nervous breakdown, where all the mental circuitry malfunctions, then he might possibly find a route into his past.
That might just possibly prove something of a problem.
Can't he be eliminated?
No, he's a symbol of opposition to the Administration.
So?
We've done psych readings which show that a high percentage of people believe that Blake's trial was a showpiece and his statements were rigged.
His death could be used by the dissidents.
They need a hero Alive or dead, Blake could be it.
Difficult.
I suppose my department could infect him, some rapidly terminal disease.
Would his natural death help?
I don't think so.
We need to discredit him.
He could be deported to Cygnus Alpha.
Doctor, am I right in thinking you can create experiences in a subject who will then believe that they really happened?
Of course.
Creating an illusion of reality is quite simple.
Good.
Then I think we can totally destroy Blake's credibility and get him sentenced.
But I'd like to do a feasibility check.
Doctor, would you come with me please?
As you wish.
- I want to bring charges soon, Morag.
- I shall report back.
- You heard?
- I heard.
Satisfied?
Not yet.
He can identify me.
My whole operation is at risk.
I'll be satisfied when the risk is eliminated.
[BLAKE'S VOICE ECHOING] Remember.
Remember.
Varon.
Come in.
Do sit down.
Thank you.
- You know Morag, don't you?
- Yes.
Varon I've got a defence assignment for you.
Not a very pleasant one, I'm afraid.
Morag is prosecuting.
The evidence is indisputable If I were you, I should concentrate on the mitigation.
Mm.
Varon, I'm going to say this because I feel so very strongly about this case.
I want you to do everything in your power to help the man.
Our first concern must be justice.
Public address:
Security clear on cell unit M 3 for Justice Department access.
I'm Tel Varon, Justice Department.
I've been assigned to defend you.
- I don't need a defence.
I'm going to plead guilty.
- Come now.
The evidence against you is strong.
I just want to make a statement in open court.
I want those responsible for the massacre brought to trial.
I'm sorry?
There can be no justification for deliberate murder.
There's nothing in the charges about murder.
There are a number of other counts Assault on a minor, attempting to corrupt minors, moral deviation.
Let me see that!
All involving children!
None of this is true!
That's why you pleading guilty surprises me.
Well, yes, but not to this, not to these charges.
They are the only charges against you.
And frankly the evidence against you is very damaging.
- Well, if there is any evidence, it's been faked!
- I've had the opportunity of talking to the children... that is, the prosecution witnesses;
and they do seem very certain of their facts.
Oh, yes, yes.
Their briefing would have been perfect.
- I'll outline how I think we should conduct your case.
- They set me up beautifully.
There is a possible approach if we could cite your record:
Your breakdown after your involvement with those illegal political groups, the remorse and guilt that you felt has placed you under an enormous strain.
We can submit that these assaults were carried out whilst you were mentally unbalanced.
I will offer no defence, but I will plead not guilty.
These are grave charges.
You might face deportation.
A mental institution would be better than spending the rest of your life on Cygnus Alpha.
I will offer no defence.
Right?
Won't you reconsider?
Even if you could prove me innocent, the charges have been made.
I've got to hand it to them.
You've done a brilliant job!
Good morning.
I've had a chance to think things through.
It's vital that I have the opportunity to make that statement to the open court.
Well that's up to the Arbiter.
It's not usual.
There's no way you can prove my innocence, is there?
You've given me no chance to try.
IS THERE?
It is doubtful.
- I AM innocent.
- I've spoken to the children.
Their statements were all verified by a lie detector.
And that puts them beyond dispute.
The Administration has gone to enormous trouble.
They've even put themselves at risk.
There must be a number of people involved who know the truth.
Why would they take that chance?
There's no possible reason that I can think of.
I know you've heard the evidence but, just for the moment, assume that I am innocent.
All right.
At first, I thought they wanted to silence me because I was the only witness to the murder of twenty people.
If they're as ruthless as you suggest, then why didn't they simply eliminate you?
Because I was something of a political figure;
or so you told me.
You had a considerable following, but then you publicly denounced your whole movement and pledged support to the Administration.
There are those who secretly believe you were coerced into that statement.
Exactly!
And my death would merely reinforce those beliefs.
It's exactly the same as if I were arraigned for being at a proscribed political meeting.
So they trump up these charges against me.
If it were true, do you realise the implications of what you're saying?
It would mean corruption at a high level of the Administration.
Public address:
Now be silent.
By the authority of the Terran Federation, this tribunal is in session.
The Arbiter will permit submissions.
Let the accused be brought forward.
Have you, the accused, been made aware of the charges that are laid against you?
Do you fully understand the nature and gravity of those charges?
Yes.
- Who speaks for the Federation?
- I do.
- Who speaks for the accused?
- I do.
Are you both satisfied that the evidence was fairly obtained?
And that all statements were certified as true and correct by lie detector?
I am.
Is the accused satisfied that his defence has been fully and fairly prepared?
The charges against me are totally false.
I am not guilty therefore I offer no defence.
Your guilt or innocence is what we are here to determine.
The case will be examined.
Let it be seen that the evidence for the prosecution is sealed and approved by the defence.
Let it be seen that the evidence for the defence is sealed and approved by the prosecution.
Let the matter be assessed and may justice prevail.
The accused has been found guilty on all charges.
His crimes have been accorded a Category 9 rating, and as such are adjudged most grave.
In sentencing you, the judgment machine has taken into account your past record, your service to the state, and your loyalty to the Federation.
None of these have mitigated in your favour.
It is the sentence of this tribunal that you be taken from this place to an area of close confinement.
From there you will be transported to the penal colony on the planet Cygnus Alpha, where you will remain for the rest of your natural life.
This matter is ended
I wish to make a statement.
There can be no more said regarding this case.
Assessment and judgment have been made.
But the evidence is false.
These charges are lies!
If you have any complaint against the conduct of this tribunal, it must be directed through your advocate.
You've got to listen to me!
Voice of Bran Foster:
They erased areas of your mind, they implanted new ideas.
They literally took your mind to pieces and rebuilt it.
When they finished, they put you up and you confessed.
You said you'd been 'misguided'.
You appealed to everyone to support the Administration, hound out the traitors.
They did a good job on you.
You were very convincing.
And then they took you back and erased even that.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No!
No!
Take it easy!
I hate personal violence, especially when I'm the person.
- Who are you?
- I'm Vila Restal.
- Where are we?
- In a transit cell.
I don't understand.
You're on your way to the penal colony on Cygnus Alpha.
Or you will be when the prison ship's refuelled.
Try to look on the bright side.
It must have something.
None of the guests have ever left early.
In fact, none of them have ever left at all.
Why are you going there?
They didn't give me a choice.
I steal things.
Compulsive, I'm afraid.
I've had my head adjusted by some of the best in the business.
But it just won't stay adjusted.
A professional thief?
More a vocation than a profession.
Other people's property comes naturally to me.
What's the time?
Just taking care of it while you were unconscious.
The place is full of criminals.
- Thanks.
- Jenna.
Blake.
What's your story?
I'm innocent.
Of what I was charged with anyway.
We have something in common, then.
All victims of a miscarriage of justice.
- It's true!
- Of course it is.
What about the others?
Oh, a very antisocial bunch.
Murderers, liars, cheats...smugglers.
Thieves.
and they're the nice people.
How long before we take off?
About 24 hours If you're expecting a last minute reprieve you'd better forget it.
Once they get you this far there's no going back.
You'd better get used to the idea.
Nobody out there gives a damn about you.
What time is it?
Late.
Come to bed.
- There's something wrong, you know.
- Blake?
The prosecution evidence was so complete that I accepted it.
I assumed Blake was guilty and concentrated on justification and appeals for mercy.
Well, what else could you do?
You interviewed all the victims, the witnesses.
- None of them had any doubts.
- Perhaps they should have.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Perhaps Blake is guilty.
Even so it's too perfect.
Where are you going?
The Public Records computer.
To look for what?
I don't know.
Give me one minute and I'll come with you.
I'm Tel Varon with the Justice Department.
I want to run a check on the medical records of those children.
It'll have to wait until the morning.
I want them now.
Alpha 3375.
C612:
Leesal, Renor.
3417:
Deca, Carl.
3512:
Fen, Payter.
Nothing.
Admissions to clinic, treatment records.
It all tallies with the evidence.
Let me have the school attendance records on those three.
Alpha 3377:
Leesal, Renor.
Interesting.
He was absent from school on the afternoon before the assault.
C417:
Deca, Carl.
So was he.
C512:
Fen, Payter.
Well that makes it more than a coincidence.
Now where were they?
Give me the admissions to the Central Clinic on that day.
Alpha 00288 Alpha.
[ALARM SIGNAL]
What's the matter?
The information has been classified.
Can't be obtained without a Priority 3 clearance.
But I need that information.
Not possible.
Look, the Justice Department can get a clearance but it takes time.
This didn't happen, of course.
No, of course it didn't.
Look at that:
Outpatient admission, identity unrecorded.
And there's another.
And a third.
Three unidentified admissions on the date the victims weren't at school.
It's not absolute proof, but it gives us somewhere to start.
But why would they have been to the clinic?
Mental implantation?
What's that?
A fictional experience implanted into the mind so vividly that it becomes reality.
Is that possible?
The process was perfected years ago, but prohibited by the medical profession.
But if it is being used again,
Blake could be telling the truth.
And that could blow the top off the whole Administration.
Come on.
Where are we going?
[COMMUNICATOR BEEP]
Security?
The meeting place how did you get to it?
I don't know.
It was dark.
Which exit did you use?
Sub 43.
43 that would be on the North side.
All right, where did you go from there?
Well, we walked for about three miles.
There was a stream.
Is there anything else you can tell us?
Yes, there was a man.
I saw him in court just before I passed out.
What about him?
I saw him at the meeting.
I thought he was one of them.
He must have betrayed them.
His name was Tarrant.
Dev Tarrant?
Do you know him?
He works in the Outer Worlds most of the time.
He's in Security.
He's a murderer.
Then he'll come to trial like everyone else in this cover up.
And what about me?
First, I'm going to get a holding order to keep you on Earth while I investigate.
You haven't got much time.
With luck I'll get you taken back to the city detention area within a couple of hours.
Thanks.
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I'll be in touch.
Friends in high places?
Can't you put a word in for me?
I'll try and think of one.
Leaving us?
I hope so.
Nothing personal.
Why are you here?
You didn't tell me.
I was trading around the Near Worlds.
I'm a free trader.
A smuggler.
She's a big name.
It's an honour to be locked up with her.
I'm glad you're pleased.
Public address:
Attention security personnel.
Launch is advanced to 17:00 hours Earth time.
That is all.
That's about eight hours.
It looks to me as though we've all been used.
It wasn't Morag's fault, but the prosecution case was based on a deception.
But why?
Well, Blake claims he was arrested after he went Outside.
Outside?
About three miles beyond Sub 43.
What did he go Outside for?
An anti Administration meeting.
He says everyone there was murdered by Security forces.
Leaving him as sole survivor?
No, him and a security agent named Tarrant.
He says Tarrant organised the massacre.
Ah, I can't believe that.
Still, it will bear examination.
Then you'll order an inquiry?
Yes.
You've raised a reasonable doubt.
The whole matter must now be investigated.
Thank you.
Now go home and get some rest.
Not yet.
I'd like your authority to go outside the city.
To look for those tunnels?
No, I'll have a team make a survey of the area.
All right.
And Blake's holding order?
Leave everything to me.
Go home and get some sleep.
You've done all you can.
Is he going to be all right?
There's something not..."to look for those tunnels".
I didn't say anything about tunnels.
What?
[COMMUNICATOR BEEP] Link me with Dr Havant.
Central Clinic.
Speakerphone:
Doctor Havant.
Voice heard through door:
Ven Glynd I think we may have a problem.
Might be best if you were unavailable for a few days.
Is it a very serious problem?
No, no, nothing that can't be handled.
I'll take a few days' leave and stay at home.
Good.
Arrange to take calls only from me.
Goodbye.
What does it mean?
It's obvious.
He's involved.
Then where do we go from here?
Higher up.
To the President if we have to.
But if we're going to make accusations against Glynd, we'll need the strongest possible evidence.
[UNCLEAR P.A. ANNOUNCEMENTS]
I'm going to try something.
[COMMUNICATOR BEEP]
Central Clinic, Doctor Havant.
Tell them it's Glynd.
Doctor Havant.
Doctor Havant, I have Glynd for you.
Sorry to call again, are there any clinical records about the matter?
Yes, of course.
They're in my office.
You want them?
Yes, I'd like to have a look at them.
I'll have them picked up from your reception.
I'll get my assistant to bring them down now.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
We've got them.
You go to the clinic and pick up the records, then go home and collect the tape camera.
Where are you going?
To talk to a thief and borrow a lock pick.
I'll meet you in 2 hours at Sub 43.
You're running out of time.
They've had long enough to issue a holding order.
It's a long process.
Don't worry, they'll get it.
I wish someone was working for me.
Until now it hasn't seemed real.
Now it's getting close, I'm getting scared.
Maja.
Did you get everything?
And there are the records from the hospital.
Good.
Yes, we can build a case on these.
Did you get what you wanted?
Come and see.
I've never been Outside before.
I have, years ago I didn't like it much; it's very strange.
[ALARM]
[KLAXON]
Listen, all of you.
Move out of here into the embarkation channel.
Come on, move!
Move out!
Pick up your bag.
Go!
Come on, faster, move!
I said move!
Single file!
One behind the other.
Keep them in line, guards.
You in front, move!
Stay here.
I'll search the bodies and get picture tapes.
[DISTANT WARNING SIRENS]
All right, come on, move.
Keep moving Come on, faster.
Keep your voice down.
Find the seat that's allocated to you and sit in it.
Fasten the harness.
Stand by for lift off.
Keep your voices down.
You, fasten your harness.
You, down in the front.
That's your seat.
Come on, move!
You, stop talking.
Fasten your harness.
How long before lift off?
You in a hurry to get there?
Don't worry.
There's still time.
I've got everything we need
Enough to keep Blake here on Earth?
More than enough.
[WARNING SIRENS]
You different to everybody else?
Fasten your harness.
What?
Hmm.
Maybe we can help you hear better.
You can start with a couple of hours confinement.
You'll be surprised how quickly your hearing improves.
Seat 11, confinement!
[INCREASING ROAR OF ENGINES]
I think a "transporter accident'.
Killed instantly.
Very tragic.
See to it, will you?
Take a long look.
That's the last you'll ever see of it.
No, I'm coming back.
25.000
Public Address:
Attention.
Level 38 walkways will be closed for one hour.
Level 38 cardholders must report to Central immediately.
Roj.
Ah, Ravella.
Did you have any trouble?
No.
You followed the route I gave you?
Yes.
Can we get on with it please?
Come on.
You've managed to do without eating and drinking?
I've done without food or drink for thirty six hours.
- How do you feel?
- Hungry and thirsty, of course.
- Nothing else?
- Ravella, is this some kind of practical joke?
It's no joke.
Public Address:
The President will be answering questions about new population control measures.
All our food and drink is treated with suppressants.
Go without for a day and a half, they should wear off.
Not that again.
Dal Richie, Roj Blake.
Been looking forward to meeting you.
I hear your family settled on the Outer Planets?
Brother and a sister on Ziegler Five.
- Do you hear from them much?
- I get vistapes a couple of times a year
Look, what is this?
I was told you had some news about them.
No, not me.
The man we're going to meet.
He wants to tell you in person.
He was on Ziegler Five a few months ago.
Where is he now?
Waiting for us, outside.
Outside?
It's not all that bad.
The air's fresh, though it smells different.
You realise going outside is a Category Four crime?
We do know the law.
So whatever you see tonight you keep silent about.
Well?
Are you coming?
Let's get on with it.
What are you doing?
Picking the lock.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
One more thing:
If you open the door, it registers on the computer.
These are circuit integrators.
Now you could steal this entire section of wall and the machine would ignore you.
Ready?
You report anything to the authorities; you'll find yourself implicated more deeply than you imagine.
[ELECTRONIC WHIRRING]
[RUNNING WATERAND DISTANT ANIMAL NOISES]
- Try some
- Hm?
It's natural water.
The stuff we get has been recycled a thousand times and dosed with suppressants.
- I'll check ahead.
Watch for my signal.
- Okay
- We've got to go across that?
- Yeah
Why should the Administration try to drug us?
To keep control.
They've been stepping up the suppressants because the number of dissidents is growing.
- They've seen what's happening and they want to stop it.
- Stop what?
Don't you know?
Don't you remember anything about the treatments they gave you?
I've had no treatments!
I thought there'd be something left, some memory.
- What about my memory?
- There's the signal
[DRONE OF DISTANT MACHINERY]
- They're Outsiders!
- Quite a few of them are working for our cause now.
It's illegal to have contact with anyone who lives outside the city!
Right, but then this whole meeting is illegal.
I'm leaving!
I want nothing to do with this.
You told me I was going to meet a man who could tell me some news about my family.
Hold on, Blake.
You've got to hear Foster.
I don't want to hear Foster!
I should report everything I've seen to the Administration.
- You can't do that
- Why not?
We've left documents in the city with your signature on them.
Forged of course, but convincing enough to implicate you in everything we've been doing.
Don't have any doubts.
One word can make you look as guilty as any of us.
And looking guilty is all it takes.
Roj!
Good to see you It's been a long time.
Bran Foster Oh!
Stupid of me.
You don't remember.
You had the treatment.
I've had no treatments, my memory is fine.
Now what is going on?
Now, now I know it's difficult for you.
It's also difficult for those of us who knew you before.
But the important thing is, you're here.
I had trouble getting out of the city.
For a while there I thought we'd been infiltrated.
- Dev Tarrant's here.
Dev!
You remember Roj Blake.
- Oh, yes.
We met before.
- I'm trying to persuade Roj to rejoin us.
- Yes.
Now, I want you to listen to what I have to tell you.
After that you can do whatever you like.
- All right.
Now what do you know about my family?
- There are other things you should know first
- Forget the other things.
- What do you know?
Your brother and sister are both dead.
I'm sorry;
I didn't intend you to hear it like that.
They were executed four years ago just after your trial.
Executed?
That's not true I hear from them regularly I had a vistape only a month ago.
Those tapes are fakes.
Part of the treatment to keep your memory suppressed.
This isn't going to be easy, but I'm going to have to tell you things about yourself.
of which you have no memory.
Will you hear me out?
Go on.
Four years ago, there was a good deal of discontent with the Administration.
There were many activist groups.
But the only one that really meant anything was led by Roj Blake.
You and I worked together.
We were outlawed and hunted.
But we had supporters and we were making progress.
Then someone betrayed us, I still don't know who.
You were captured.
So were most of our followers.
They could have killed you.
But that would have given the cause a martyr.
So instead they put you into intensive therapy.
They erased areas of your mind, they implanted new ideas.
They literally took your mind to pieces and rebuilt it.
And when they'd finished, you confessed.
You said you'd been "misguided".
You appealed to everyone to support the Administration, hound out the traitors.
They did a good job on you.
You were very convincing.
Then they took you back and erased even that.
What happened to the others?
In their benevolence, the Federation allowed them to emigrate to the Outer Worlds.
Like your family, they were executed on arrival.
Why are you telling me this now?
Because we're preparing to move again.
And if you were with us we'd get more support.
How do you feel?
Will you help us again?
- I don't know I'm not even sure that I believe you.
- It's all true.
- I have to think.
- Of course.
We'll talk after the meeting.
What do you think?
There's not much left of the man I knew.
We'll see.
All right, let's get started, shall we?
Come on everybody.
Let's start the meeting now.
You come over here and make a group.
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you for turning up.
We all know the risks that we're running in being here, so I'll be as brief as possible.
You've probably heard that the settlers in the Outer Worlds are rightly demanding greater autonomy.
If we can help to unify their voices, the Administration will have to listen.
The security forces are already overstretched.
If we step up our civil disobedience here on Earth, they will have to concentrate their forces here, giving the Outer Worlds more freedom of action.
We must aim to have at least one world declare its independence within the next two years.
Trooper Communication:
Unit three, move in.
I think most of you know my old friend, Dev Tarrant Dev will give you details of how we can all help.
We've got to cause as much disruption as possible in the food manufacturing division.
There's nothing more effective than ration cuts to cause unrest.
I've worked out methods to implement this disruption.
Do not attempt to resist arrest.
No matter what the provocation; we must not resort to violence.
We claim our rights as citizens, and demand to be treated as civil prisoners.
[GUNFIRE SCREAMING]
You're obviously suffering from a severe emotional disturbance.
We must try to unravel this fantasy.
It is NOT a fantasy.
Of course it isn't.
Do you believe me?
To you it isn't a fantasy.
Get out!
Leave me alone!
Reality is a dangerous concept.
Each one of us interprets it in a slightly different way.
Every sense impression is filtered by the brain and altered, sometimes just a little, sometimes completely, to fit our individual model of what the world is about.
If that model should be challenged.
I am NOT insane I am NOT insane.
No!
You must put that thought completely out of your mind.
You've had a shock.
Yes.
We must work together to uncover what that shock was.
I'm going to prescribe a mild sedative.
No drugs!
A mild sedative to help you to sleep.
You must rest.
No!
No drugs.
All right, no drugs.
Now try not to think anymore.
Don't worry; we'll get it sorted out.
I can't remember.
I can't remember!
Can he break through the memory blocks, Dr Havant?
It's unlikely.
We don't eradicate memory, merely make it inaccessible.
But in the normal, healthy mind the barriers are impenetrable.
Should he suffer anything like a nervous breakdown, where all the mental circuitry malfunctions, then he might possibly find a route into his past.
That might just possibly prove something of a problem.
Can't he be eliminated?
No, he's a symbol of opposition to the Administration.
So?
We've done psych readings which show that a high percentage of people believe that Blake's trial was a showpiece and his statements were rigged.
His death could be used by the dissidents.
They need a hero Alive or dead, Blake could be it.
Difficult.
I suppose my department could infect him, some rapidly terminal disease.
Would his natural death help?
I don't think so.
We need to discredit him.
He could be deported to Cygnus Alpha.
Doctor, am I right in thinking you can create experiences in a subject who will then believe that they really happened?
Of course.
Creating an illusion of reality is quite simple.
Good.
Then I think we can totally destroy Blake's credibility and get him sentenced.
But I'd like to do a feasibility check.
Doctor, would you come with me please?
As you wish.
- I want to bring charges soon, Morag.
- I shall report back.
- You heard?
- I heard.
Satisfied?
Not yet.
He can identify me.
My whole operation is at risk.
I'll be satisfied when the risk is eliminated.
[BLAKE'S VOICE ECHOING] Remember.
Remember.
Varon.
Come in.
Do sit down.
Thank you.
- You know Morag, don't you?
- Yes.
Varon I've got a defence assignment for you.
Not a very pleasant one, I'm afraid.
Morag is prosecuting.
The evidence is indisputable If I were you, I should concentrate on the mitigation.
Mm.
Varon, I'm going to say this because I feel so very strongly about this case.
I want you to do everything in your power to help the man.
Our first concern must be justice.
Public address:
Security clear on cell unit M 3 for Justice Department access.
I'm Tel Varon, Justice Department.
I've been assigned to defend you.
- I don't need a defence.
I'm going to plead guilty.
- Come now.
The evidence against you is strong.
I just want to make a statement in open court.
I want those responsible for the massacre brought to trial.
I'm sorry?
There can be no justification for deliberate murder.
There's nothing in the charges about murder.
There are a number of other counts Assault on a minor, attempting to corrupt minors, moral deviation.
Let me see that!
All involving children!
None of this is true!
That's why you pleading guilty surprises me.
Well, yes, but not to this, not to these charges.
They are the only charges against you.
And frankly the evidence against you is very damaging.
- Well, if there is any evidence, it's been faked!
- I've had the opportunity of talking to the children... that is, the prosecution witnesses;
and they do seem very certain of their facts.
Oh, yes, yes.
Their briefing would have been perfect.
- I'll outline how I think we should conduct your case.
- They set me up beautifully.
There is a possible approach if we could cite your record:
Your breakdown after your involvement with those illegal political groups, the remorse and guilt that you felt has placed you under an enormous strain.
We can submit that these assaults were carried out whilst you were mentally unbalanced.
I will offer no defence, but I will plead not guilty.
These are grave charges.
You might face deportation.
A mental institution would be better than spending the rest of your life on Cygnus Alpha.
I will offer no defence.
Right?
Won't you reconsider?
Even if you could prove me innocent, the charges have been made.
I've got to hand it to them.
You've done a brilliant job!
Good morning.
I've had a chance to think things through.
It's vital that I have the opportunity to make that statement to the open court.
Well that's up to the Arbiter.
It's not usual.
There's no way you can prove my innocence, is there?
You've given me no chance to try.
IS THERE?
It is doubtful.
- I AM innocent.
- I've spoken to the children.
Their statements were all verified by a lie detector.
And that puts them beyond dispute.
The Administration has gone to enormous trouble.
They've even put themselves at risk.
There must be a number of people involved who know the truth.
Why would they take that chance?
There's no possible reason that I can think of.
I know you've heard the evidence but, just for the moment, assume that I am innocent.
All right.
At first, I thought they wanted to silence me because I was the only witness to the murder of twenty people.
If they're as ruthless as you suggest, then why didn't they simply eliminate you?
Because I was something of a political figure;
or so you told me.
You had a considerable following, but then you publicly denounced your whole movement and pledged support to the Administration.
There are those who secretly believe you were coerced into that statement.
Exactly!
And my death would merely reinforce those beliefs.
It's exactly the same as if I were arraigned for being at a proscribed political meeting.
So they trump up these charges against me.
If it were true, do you realise the implications of what you're saying?
It would mean corruption at a high level of the Administration.
Public address:
Now be silent.
By the authority of the Terran Federation, this tribunal is in session.
The Arbiter will permit submissions.
Let the accused be brought forward.
Have you, the accused, been made aware of the charges that are laid against you?
Do you fully understand the nature and gravity of those charges?
Yes.
- Who speaks for the Federation?
- I do.
- Who speaks for the accused?
- I do.
Are you both satisfied that the evidence was fairly obtained?
And that all statements were certified as true and correct by lie detector?
I am.
Is the accused satisfied that his defence has been fully and fairly prepared?
The charges against me are totally false.
I am not guilty therefore I offer no defence.
Your guilt or innocence is what we are here to determine.
The case will be examined.
Let it be seen that the evidence for the prosecution is sealed and approved by the defence.
Let it be seen that the evidence for the defence is sealed and approved by the prosecution.
Let the matter be assessed and may justice prevail.
The accused has been found guilty on all charges.
His crimes have been accorded a Category 9 rating, and as such are adjudged most grave.
In sentencing you, the judgment machine has taken into account your past record, your service to the state, and your loyalty to the Federation.
None of these have mitigated in your favour.
It is the sentence of this tribunal that you be taken from this place to an area of close confinement.
From there you will be transported to the penal colony on the planet Cygnus Alpha, where you will remain for the rest of your natural life.
This matter is ended
I wish to make a statement.
There can be no more said regarding this case.
Assessment and judgment have been made.
But the evidence is false.
These charges are lies!
If you have any complaint against the conduct of this tribunal, it must be directed through your advocate.
You've got to listen to me!
Voice of Bran Foster:
They erased areas of your mind, they implanted new ideas.
They literally took your mind to pieces and rebuilt it.
When they finished, they put you up and you confessed.
You said you'd been 'misguided'.
You appealed to everyone to support the Administration, hound out the traitors.
They did a good job on you.
You were very convincing.
And then they took you back and erased even that.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No!
No!
Take it easy!
I hate personal violence, especially when I'm the person.
- Who are you?
- I'm Vila Restal.
- Where are we?
- In a transit cell.
I don't understand.
You're on your way to the penal colony on Cygnus Alpha.
Or you will be when the prison ship's refuelled.
Try to look on the bright side.
It must have something.
None of the guests have ever left early.
In fact, none of them have ever left at all.
Why are you going there?
They didn't give me a choice.
I steal things.
Compulsive, I'm afraid.
I've had my head adjusted by some of the best in the business.
But it just won't stay adjusted.
A professional thief?
More a vocation than a profession.
Other people's property comes naturally to me.
What's the time?
Just taking care of it while you were unconscious.
The place is full of criminals.
- Thanks.
- Jenna.
Blake.
What's your story?
I'm innocent.
Of what I was charged with anyway.
We have something in common, then.
All victims of a miscarriage of justice.
- It's true!
- Of course it is.
What about the others?
Oh, a very antisocial bunch.
Murderers, liars, cheats...smugglers.
Thieves.
and they're the nice people.
How long before we take off?
About 24 hours If you're expecting a last minute reprieve you'd better forget it.
Once they get you this far there's no going back.
You'd better get used to the idea.
Nobody out there gives a damn about you.
What time is it?
Late.
Come to bed.
- There's something wrong, you know.
- Blake?
The prosecution evidence was so complete that I accepted it.
I assumed Blake was guilty and concentrated on justification and appeals for mercy.
Well, what else could you do?
You interviewed all the victims, the witnesses.
- None of them had any doubts.
- Perhaps they should have.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Perhaps Blake is guilty.
Even so it's too perfect.
Where are you going?
The Public Records computer.
To look for what?
I don't know.
Give me one minute and I'll come with you.
I'm Tel Varon with the Justice Department.
I want to run a check on the medical records of those children.
It'll have to wait until the morning.
I want them now.
Alpha 3375.
C612:
Leesal, Renor.
3417:
Deca, Carl.
3512:
Fen, Payter.
Nothing.
Admissions to clinic, treatment records.
It all tallies with the evidence.
Let me have the school attendance records on those three.
Alpha 3377:
Leesal, Renor.
Interesting.
He was absent from school on the afternoon before the assault.
C417:
Deca, Carl.
So was he.
C512:
Fen, Payter.
Well that makes it more than a coincidence.
Now where were they?
Give me the admissions to the Central Clinic on that day.
Alpha 00288 Alpha.
[ALARM SIGNAL]
What's the matter?
The information has been classified.
Can't be obtained without a Priority 3 clearance.
But I need that information.
Not possible.
Look, the Justice Department can get a clearance but it takes time.
This didn't happen, of course.
No, of course it didn't.
Look at that:
Outpatient admission, identity unrecorded.
And there's another.
And a third.
Three unidentified admissions on the date the victims weren't at school.
It's not absolute proof, but it gives us somewhere to start.
But why would they have been to the clinic?
Mental implantation?
What's that?
A fictional experience implanted into the mind so vividly that it becomes reality.
Is that possible?
The process was perfected years ago, but prohibited by the medical profession.
But if it is being used again,
Blake could be telling the truth.
And that could blow the top off the whole Administration.
Come on.
Where are we going?
[COMMUNICATOR BEEP]
Security?
The meeting place how did you get to it?
I don't know.
It was dark.
Which exit did you use?
Sub 43.
43 that would be on the North side.
All right, where did you go from there?
Well, we walked for about three miles.
There was a stream.
Is there anything else you can tell us?
Yes, there was a man.
I saw him in court just before I passed out.
What about him?
I saw him at the meeting.
I thought he was one of them.
He must have betrayed them.
His name was Tarrant.
Dev Tarrant?
Do you know him?
He works in the Outer Worlds most of the time.
He's in Security.
He's a murderer.
Then he'll come to trial like everyone else in this cover up.
And what about me?
First, I'm going to get a holding order to keep you on Earth while I investigate.
You haven't got much time.
With luck I'll get you taken back to the city detention area within a couple of hours.
Thanks.
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I'll be in touch.
Friends in high places?
Can't you put a word in for me?
I'll try and think of one.
Leaving us?
I hope so.
Nothing personal.
Why are you here?
You didn't tell me.
I was trading around the Near Worlds.
I'm a free trader.
A smuggler.
She's a big name.
It's an honour to be locked up with her.
I'm glad you're pleased.
Public address:
Attention security personnel.
Launch is advanced to 17:00 hours Earth time.
That is all.
That's about eight hours.
It looks to me as though we've all been used.
It wasn't Morag's fault, but the prosecution case was based on a deception.
But why?
Well, Blake claims he was arrested after he went Outside.
Outside?
About three miles beyond Sub 43.
What did he go Outside for?
An anti Administration meeting.
He says everyone there was murdered by Security forces.
Leaving him as sole survivor?
No, him and a security agent named Tarrant.
He says Tarrant organised the massacre.
Ah, I can't believe that.
Still, it will bear examination.
Then you'll order an inquiry?
Yes.
You've raised a reasonable doubt.
The whole matter must now be investigated.
Thank you.
Now go home and get some rest.
Not yet.
I'd like your authority to go outside the city.
To look for those tunnels?
No, I'll have a team make a survey of the area.
All right.
And Blake's holding order?
Leave everything to me.
Go home and get some sleep.
You've done all you can.
Is he going to be all right?
There's something not..."to look for those tunnels".
I didn't say anything about tunnels.
What?
[COMMUNICATOR BEEP] Link me with Dr Havant.
Central Clinic.
Speakerphone:
Doctor Havant.
Voice heard through door:
Ven Glynd I think we may have a problem.
Might be best if you were unavailable for a few days.
Is it a very serious problem?
No, no, nothing that can't be handled.
I'll take a few days' leave and stay at home.
Good.
Arrange to take calls only from me.
Goodbye.
What does it mean?
It's obvious.
He's involved.
Then where do we go from here?
Higher up.
To the President if we have to.
But if we're going to make accusations against Glynd, we'll need the strongest possible evidence.
[UNCLEAR P.A. ANNOUNCEMENTS]
I'm going to try something.
[COMMUNICATOR BEEP]
Central Clinic, Doctor Havant.
Tell them it's Glynd.
Doctor Havant.
Doctor Havant, I have Glynd for you.
Sorry to call again, are there any clinical records about the matter?
Yes, of course.
They're in my office.
You want them?
Yes, I'd like to have a look at them.
I'll have them picked up from your reception.
I'll get my assistant to bring them down now.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
We've got them.
You go to the clinic and pick up the records, then go home and collect the tape camera.
Where are you going?
To talk to a thief and borrow a lock pick.
I'll meet you in 2 hours at Sub 43.
You're running out of time.
They've had long enough to issue a holding order.
It's a long process.
Don't worry, they'll get it.
I wish someone was working for me.
Until now it hasn't seemed real.
Now it's getting close, I'm getting scared.
Maja.
Did you get everything?
And there are the records from the hospital.
Good.
Yes, we can build a case on these.
Did you get what you wanted?
Come and see.
I've never been Outside before.
I have, years ago I didn't like it much; it's very strange.
[ALARM]
[KLAXON]
Listen, all of you.
Move out of here into the embarkation channel.
Come on, move!
Move out!
Pick up your bag.
Go!
Come on, faster, move!
I said move!
Single file!
One behind the other.
Keep them in line, guards.
You in front, move!
Stay here.
I'll search the bodies and get picture tapes.
[DISTANT WARNING SIRENS]
All right, come on, move.
Keep moving Come on, faster.
Keep your voice down.
Find the seat that's allocated to you and sit in it.
Fasten the harness.
Stand by for lift off.
Keep your voices down.
You, fasten your harness.
You, down in the front.
That's your seat.
Come on, move!
You, stop talking.
Fasten your harness.
How long before lift off?
You in a hurry to get there?
Don't worry.
There's still time.
I've got everything we need
Enough to keep Blake here on Earth?
More than enough.
[WARNING SIRENS]
You different to everybody else?
Fasten your harness.
What?
Hmm.
Maybe we can help you hear better.
You can start with a couple of hours confinement.
You'll be surprised how quickly your hearing improves.
Seat 11, confinement!
[INCREASING ROAR OF ENGINES]
I think a "transporter accident'.
Killed instantly.
Very tragic.
See to it, will you?
Take a long look.
That's the last you'll ever see of it.
No, I'm coming back.
I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home
Yankee Doodle went to town A- riding on a pony
Put a feather in his cap and called it macaroni
In a cavern, In a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Lived a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter Clementine 15-12 , I've got a siren.
15-14 , meet me on Tech 2.
Roger, go ahead 15-12.
I'm at Riverside and Laurel.
My ETA is one minute.
Proceed to Magnolia and Hollywood Way.
Stay on Tech 2.
15-14 I've got a reckless driver in front of me approaching the intersection.
Roger 15-12.
I am eastbound on Magnolia from Riverside.
He's driving a white or a gray early model...
Look out!
I think I hurt my neck.
Where are the gun effects?
Bring 'em up, fellas.
Looking for it.
The music's too big.
Okay, now, when he gets into the alley, what I want to hear is just the pulse track on the music.
Let's take it from the top.
Okay, John?
Everything's okay with me.
I'm just the producer.
Going back, Allen.
Kay, you're a very busy lady.
Why don't you get out of the grease pit and let me dub the film?
Because you boys at the studio get to have all the fun.
While we, over at the network, all we get to do is pay for these pictures and try to let you know what we want and how we want it.
How's that for a massage?
So how's the picture look?
Getting there.
Like pulling teeth.
Hmm.
Lunch?
Mmm-hmm.
Shrimp Salad.
Peace.
Peace.
He in?
Yeah, meeting.
But New York is getting a little anxious.
Do you really have to tell me that?
Gentlemen.
Kay.
Hello.
Let me worry about New York.
Clay Gardner, what's he really gonna cost us?
Henry, did you check his agent out?
You want a price on Clay Gardner?
His agent just smiles and smiles.
Did you see the final dub?
Don't we wish.
At that studio, another three days.
Let me put it this way.
Can I show The Professional to the New York bunch, and will I want to?
Yes, you can show it and yes, you will want to.
You heard that Kay Freestone guarantees a 40 share.
Okay, friends, thank you much.
Jonathan, fill me in.
I ran the network demographics on the six Clay Gardner movies.
Believe it or not, his strongest appeal...
Yes, Madge.
Mr. Flanagan in New York, on three.
Hello, Mark.
Hello, Frank, how are you?
How's that great New York weather?
Well, how do you think?
It's still snowing.
I hate to tell you this but I went sailing yesterday.
Mark, how tough would it be to give up sailing in the winter?
What did you have in mind, Frank?
New York.
For how long?
Long as you want.
Forever.
It'll be out Tuesday, definite.
Hated California It's cold and it's damp
Hey!
Breakfast!
Happy Sunday.
Well, Saturday wasn't too shabby.
You can read me the funnies.
Frank Flanagan called.
I got New York.
The whole damn network.
Baby, we did it, we did it, we did it.
When do we leave?
I want you to stay here, Kay.
Your job!
You are giving me the job?
What's going on here?
I can't give you the West Coast, babe.
Well, now.
I thought I'd earned something.
At what you do, Kay, you're the best there is.
You're the very best.
But you don't make decisions.
You make guesses.
There's a difference.
Guesses just aren't good enough.
But you'll learn.
Right.
Right.
I'm learning already.
Don't make it any tougher than it is.
Poor baby.
Here I am worrying about myself.
Poor, precious Mark suffering through the awful truth.
Farewell, my dearest, the time has come.
Great secret lovers.
Super corporate team.
But onward and upward.
Whoop-dee-doo.
Kay in the end all we really owe each other is a little bit of affection.
Nobody was keeping tabs, were they?
So much for overtime, so much for double time, so much for playtime.
Kay.
You wanna sue me?
Shoot me?
That make you feel better?
Right through the heart.
Make me a perfect murder, babe.
Kay.
You were supposed to find these out there.
A 450SL.
The silver one.
It's the one you always wanted.
It's still at the dealer showroom.
But it's registered in your name.
You can drive it home.
The license plate says, "Kay #1."
Well, that's a comment from the management.
Goodbye, Kay?
Sit up, Lieutenant.
I want you to relax.
Tilt your head back.
What...
What are you gonna do?
Just give your neck a little adjustment.
What do you mean by adjustment?
Don't worry, Lieutenant, it won't hurt at all.
I'll tell you, Sam, I don't think it hurts anymore.
It won't hurt at all.
Sam, it already doesn't hurt at all.
Relax.
Relax.
You have one minute and 20 seconds.
You have one minute and 10 seconds.
You have one minute.
You have 50 seconds.
You have 40 seconds.
You have 30 seconds to go.
You have 20 seconds.
You have 10 seconds left.
Nine seconds.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Out.
Oh, hello, Kay.
Sorry, Jonathan.
I'm going to need all those Clay Gardner demographs first thing in the morning.
Kay, that's gonna take all night.
Well, unless you'd like to explain your troubles to Mr. Flanagan, you'd better plan on spending the night.
Condolences, Junior.
Comes with the territory.
Well, who says Clay Gardner's ready to do TV?
Just once I'd like to sit down to a hot meal.
At $7 million a season, let's just say he might be tempted.
His agent take the hook yet?
No, I'm still setting it.
Planes don't count.
That's toy food.
It's really up to Frank.
What do you think, Pete?
Before, I got to be a VP...
Now I put it between bread.
We'll still come out of it.
Do you really want to lay out that kind of cash, Frank?
If we start paying $7 million, every actor we have will wanna renegotiate.
Clay Gardner isn't every actor.
Thank God.
Mr. Flanagan, gentlemen.
Kay.
Hi, Kay.
Soon as you've had your ice cream and cookies, we'll go to the movies.
All right, guys, let's go.
This way, gentlemen.
That's right.
What have you got?
I hope I'm gonna see you guys in my office later.
We'll see you later.
Mark.
Let's roll the dice on Clay Gardner before I change my mind.
You got it.
Pete, listen, we're gonna go with Gardner.
So, first thing tomorrow set up a negotiating session.
I'll call Herbie Stone.
You all right?
I'm fine.
No, I mean really.
I mean, I'm really fine, Mark.
Good.
He can handle it.
Well, this picture is very much a Kay Freestone effort, I understand.
Oh, yes.
You'll find little flecks of my blood on each and every frame.
Gentlemen, I'll be in the booth.
Enjoy yourselves.
Thank you.
Frank, do you really think that William Morris will cave-in that much on the price?
A million at least.
You got to be kidding it's seven.
Nobody believes seven.
Evening, Walter.
Hi, Kay.
VIP time, huh?
Oh, it's murder.
You got all nine reels here?
Ninety minutes, nine reels.
Okay.
You watching back here again, huh?
Walter,
I wrestled this bloody film through that nutty studio for six months.
If you so much as make one mistake in a changeover,
I'll kill you.
Yowsah, Miss Freestone.
Your film is gonna go through this gate at the incredible rate of 90 feet per minute.
You just watch this little old counter here.
And no sooner will this first reel finish up when I will see two little flashes of light out there in the upper right hand corner of your lovely picture.
And then I will, with lightning speed, switch over to this projector right here.
And not only will your big-shots not know that I have switched a reel, they'll not suspect one little old thing.
Bravo.
Kay, roll when you're ready.
All right.
Okay.
What's this called?
The Professional.
Mmm.
Good luck.
Thanks, I'll need it.
Frank, has Standards and Practices seen this yet?
Changeover.
Flash.
Go.
Couldn't have done it better myself.
Marius?
Not exactly the family hour, is it?
Walter, where are those other reels?
What other reels?
Screen tests that I ordered for Broad Land.
Flanagan might want to see them.
Oh, somebody goofed.
They must still be down in Shipping.
Well, you better go get them.
Four reels.
Well, there's a changeover coming in about two minutes.
I'll take care of the changeover.
You just get those reels for me, please.
You have four minutes.
You have three minutes and 50 seconds.
You have three minutes and 40 seconds.
You have three minutes and 30 seconds.
You have three minutes and 20 seconds.
You have three minutes and 10 seconds.
You have three minutes.
You have two minutes and 50 seconds.
Finished already?
Yes.
Finished.
Honey, wait a minute, wait a...
You have two minutes and 10 seconds.
Mark?
You have two minutes.
You have one minute and 30 seconds.
You have one minute and 20 seconds.
You have one minute and 10 seconds.
You have one minute.
You have 50 seconds.
You have 40 seconds.
You have 30 seconds.
You have 25 seconds.
Twenty seconds.
You have 15 seconds left.
You have 10 seconds.
Nine.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Make the changeover okay?
Like a champ.
All right.
Well, how's it going?
Well, no one's left yet.
How long are they gonna keep putting that stuff on television?
Kay, would you come in here a minute?
What?
I'll be right in.
Walter, no more picture tonight.
Kay, I'm so terribly shocked.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, we're all very sorry.
I'm sure he'd be the first one to say there's no disrespect in our just doing our jobs.
What is there for today?
They asked for you in Mark's office.
Soon as you came in.
Kay, steady, love.
Good morning, ma'am.
Lieutenant Columbo, Homicide.
And you're Miss Freestone?
Yes, Lieutenant.
No disrespect intended, ma'am, but that's where Mr. McAndrews was lying, just like that.
When he was shot, that is.
Is there any way I can be of help, Lieutenant?
I don't believe so, ma'am.
Nice of you to offer.
We think it's a whiplash.
The doctors are making tests.
I'm so sorry.
No, I...
I meant, is there any way I can help you with your investigation?
Oh, the investigation.
Yes, ma'am, I think there is.
Now, I understand that you worked very closely with the victim.
Yes, I was his executive assistant.
Yes, ma'am.
And would you agree that these were his glasses?
They look like them, yes.
Then would you mind coming through that door, ma'am?
Excuse me?
If you would just go out and come through that door, please.
Come on in, ma'am.
Come on in.
Stop right there, ma'am.
Now, if you'll just hold out your arm.
Where?
Just point it at me, ma'am.
Like you were holding a pistol.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
My father wore glasses just like these.
And when I was a youngster, I used to like to put them on.
Made me feel like a grown-up.
There's something I wanted to ask you about Mr. McAndrews, ma'am.
An item that I found here on his desk a little piece of paper.
Well, it will turn up.
My mother used to grab the glasses off me.
"They're bad for your eyes," she used to say.
You know, in those days, everything was bad for your eyes.
Not wearing mittens was bad for your eyes.
Wearing rubbers in the house, that'd strike you blind on the spot.
I don't know what I did with that damn paper.
Well, it will turn up.
That must be very uncomfortable.
Ma'am?
Oh, this?
Well, it's better than a gallstone.
Did you ever have a gallstone, ma'am?
Whew!
No, I don't think so.
If there's nothing else, Lieutenant...
I've got 12 men searching, Lieutenant.
Is that enough?
As many as you can get, Sergeant.
We haven't found the weapon, ma'am.
We think it still might be on the premises.
I know there was a paper on this desk.
Oh, Sergeant Burke, this is Miss Freestone.
She was Mr. McAndrews' executive assistant.
Found you.
I think you're wanted in your office.
Something about Mr. Flanagan.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant, I think there's something you should see.
Would you mind coming with me?
Certainly, ma'am.
Keep searching, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
We lost a hell of a lot more than manpower.
No, they don't know anything yet.
Yes, I'll be staying around until we can get the pieces back together.
Kay, I hope I didn't take you away.
You all right?
Your men have everything they need, Lieutenant?
Well, it's very confusing, sir.
I mean, there were only so many people in the building last night.
You and your people, Miss Freestone and the projectionist and the young man working next door.
Every single one of them is accounted for.
With your terrific security and all, no one else could get in or out of the building.
So the question is, who killed Mr. McAndrews?
That's why I want you to look at these, Lieutenant.
You personally won this award yourself, ma'am?
Indeed she did, Lieutenant.
"For Best Documentary Production."
Well, you certainly are a very clever woman, ma'am.
That's why she's with us.
Very clever indeed.
Let's just say I work like an ox.
Please sit right here, Lieutenant.
Thank you, ma'am.
Kay.
Under the circumstances, I'm gonna ask something of you.
We'd like you to help us by taking over all of Mark's duties, at least for the time being.
Of course.
Anything I can do to help, Mr. Flanagan.
Good.
I knew I could count on you.
You can start by locking up Clay Gardner in The Broad Land.
Oh, Mr. Flanagan, I wanted to talk to you about The Professional, the film last night?
I think we should talk about that some other time.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I'm sure it'll be off in a few days.
I call it weird, ma'am.
All these crazy crank letters.
Have you ever told the police about these threats?
Yes, I certainly have.
You'll notice that the network gets blamed for everything that's going, be it communism, fascism, atheism, abortion, sex, violence.
You name it.
Up, down or in the middle.
It's all the same thing.
"Support decency or we'll kill you."
Signed in blood.
So, naturally, when this happened, it occurred to me...
That one of these nuts slipped in here and killed Mr. McAndrews?
Well, other attempts have been made, twice on Mr. Flanagan.
I don't think so, ma'am.
Not in this case.
Granted, there's a lot of nuts running around, some of them dangerous.
Not in this case.
You seem very sure, Lieutenant.
That's because Mr. McAndrews recognized his murderer.
He knew the person who shot him.
I find that very hard to believe.
I don't wanna distress you, ma'am, but there's no doubt about it.
I know I had that paper somewhere.
Why is there no doubt about it?
We know the angle of the bullet, ma'am.
We know that the murderer didn't shoot from the door.
He entered the office.
I'd say he was 18 feet in by the time he pulled the trigger.
Well, why couldn't a stranger be 18 feet into a room?
Well, let me put it to you this way, ma'am.
If you were alone in a room at night, lying on a couch, and a stranger entered, wouldn't you take a good look at him?
Wouldn't you wanna see what he looked like?
Yes.
That's the point, ma'am.
Mr. McAndrews didn't bother to take a really good look.
It's these glasses, ma'am.
He had them up here on his forehead when he was shot.
When the murderer came into the room.
So Mr. McAndrews must've known exactly who that person was, or he would've pushed them down, like this.
Because with these type corrections, ma'am, these bifocals, this is the only way that Mr. McAndrews could see his killer.
If the killer was a stranger, that is.
Which he couldn't have been.
But I'll keep your theory in mind.
Interesting, isn't it, how you can work these small things out if you just think about it?
Like you got a tiny voice whispering right in your ear, trying to tell you who did it.
You're a very attentive listener, Lieutenant.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Why that's all we got to go on.
Listen and look, look and listen.
You see, you watch your counter for the blip and then you stand by for the blip.
You mean to tell me that all these years, every time I took Mrs. Columbo to the theater, those flashes were on the screen?
They have been on the screen even before Mrs. Columbo, Lieutenant.
The upper right hand corner.
In a regular theater?
A regular theater.
If I go to the movies tonight, 8:30, down the block, a dollar and a half, and I walk in and sit down and watch the movie, you mean to tell me that I will see those flashes on the screen?
Right.
That goes to show you, you learn something new every day.
Now, the flashes tell the projectionist when he's supposed to change his reel.
All right, all right, watch.
Flash.
Now, you tell me when you see the second one.
Flash.
Mr. Mearhead,
I would say you did that like an artist.
Listen, you wanna see art, Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, this is art.
Isn't that remarkable?
You did that yourself?
That I did, sir.
When I was a kid, I used to build model airplanes.
I'd start them but I could never finish them.
I'd always wreck them.
Miss Freestone, she made the changeover last night when you went out for The Broad Land screen tests?
Yeah, about two minutes after I left.
I checked that counter.
You checked the counter,
Miss Freestone, she changed the projector.
Did Miss Freestone make the splice, too?
What splice?
You mean the film didn't break?
Isn't this one of those editor's gloves?
Right.
I mean, she could've fixed the film if anything happened, but nothing happened to the film.
You see,
I use these gloves because of the glue.
Well, thank you very much, sir.
Do you think it would be asking too much if I took one of these things for my nephew?
Sure, help yourself.
The kid's 15-years-old and he sold all his stereo stuff to make eight-millimeter movies.
When I was a kid in my neighborhood, we had heroes.
DiMaggio, Rizzuto...
You know who he's got on the wall?
Francis Ford Coppola.
Sorry, ma'am.
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Oh, Walter, you can send those test reels back to Shipping anytime.
Oh, those tests, ma'am, the tests, they've already gone back to Shipping.
I spoke to the gentleman in charge.
Oh.
Fine, then.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
About those tests that you sent out for last night.
Those were tests for a new series called The Broad Land?
Yes, Lieutenant, they were talent tests.
Yes, well there's something that I don't understand, ma'am, and maybe I should...
I probably should...
Lord knows I'm not the brightest guy on the force.
Another detective, he could cut right through all this.
I understand, Lieutenant.
Just ask your questions.
That's the problem, ma'am.
When I ask the questions, I know I'm putting you on the spot.
It's perfectly all right, Lieutenant.
It's your job.
I appreciate that.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
If only more people felt that way.
The question is...
Mr. Flanagan says that he already approved Clay Gardner to star in that new series.
So I had to ask myself, if he already approved him, why would you wanna show him more tests?
You see my problem, ma'am?
Yes, I do, and I wondered exactly the same thing myself.
Did you?
Mmm-hmm.
This time I think you're listening to the wrong little voice in your ear, Lieutenant.
I was just following instructions.
Mr. Flanagan's instructions?
Mr. McAndrews' instructions.
Written instructions, ma'am?
Verbal instructions, Lieutenant.
I see.
Well, we certainly can't ask Mr. McAndrews, can we?
I'm afraid I do have to go, Lieutenant.
Oh, ma'am.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I know you're pressed.
I don't wanna hold you up.
Can we walk and talk?
Let's.
I know that Mr. McAndrews was an important executive, and I know that CNC is a big television network.
But I have no idea what he did all day and night, from what I can see around here.
Well, I can hardly speak for his nights, Lieutenant.
I didn't mean to imply, ma'am.
His days were mostly like mine.
We run a fire department around here.
Do you want to look at some of the flames?
Flames, ma'am?
Yes, mostly we put out fires.
Nancy, monitor two.
One, please.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Yeah, now, that's the angle I want for the third position.
Looking nice kids.
Looking very good.
Start from the top and I'll watch it up here.
Oh, Kay, we've already lost two hours.
Where is she?
Luther will tell you.
Oh, Lieutenant, I'll be busy for a minute.
Just help yourself.
Don't worry about me, ma'am.
Luther?
Coming down.
You can take a break now, Nancy.
Thanks.
All right, everybody, five minutes, please.
Where are we?
Replace her, Kay.
Valerie?
She's never gonna make it.
Not a live show.
Not in this world.
Oh, come on, we're on tomorrow night.
She's terrified, she's hysterical.
She's losing her mind.
I mean, she doesn't even understand that this is not an MGM sound stage 20 years ago.
She hates the blocking, she hates the camera, she hates me.
You, I don't know about.
Look, a few times a day she'll have a nice rush of confidence for 10 minutes and then she'll remember it's a live show, bite one of the dancers on the leg and run to her dressing room and hide.
Aside from all that, her work is lousy.
Where is she?
Dressing room.
Luther, is she on anything?
Oh, please.
You mean it's gonna be live TV, just the way it used to be?
A little bit better, Lieutenant, we hope.
This is where the director will sit.
Here, sit down.
This is a technical director's console.
Does that bother you?
That's just whiplash.
I mean, I think it's a whiplash.
My doctor thinks it's a whiplash.
The chiropractor, he thinks I just got a bad massage.
And my wife's osteopath, he thinks it might be a back problem.
It doesn't look like a back problem.
That's what the orthopedic man said.
Listen, all these screens for just one show?
That's a line monitor.
That's what's going on the air.
Preview monitor is what the director wants up next and those are what the four cameras see.
I do the switching.
Hey, all these beautiful machines in here, all these buttons to push.
I know it costs millions and I know that everybody works very hard.
But I gotta tell you the truth.
To me, it looks like fun.
It is, but I wouldn't swear to it in court.
And Miss Freestone, she understands all about this, too?
I'll tell you about that.
If there's one thing worse than a television lady who thinks she knows everything, it's a television lady who knows everything.
I'll see you later, Lieutenant.
Valerie.
Val, it's Kay.
Whose side are you on?
Whose do you think?
Prove it.
You can keep the key to my apartment.
Oh, Kay.
Give me a hug.
Oh, I thought you'd never get here.
Did Luther get over his snit yet?
How about yours?
Big deal.
I tried to tell that genius where to put my key light and the roof fell in.
Big man from New York.
Luther's very good.
He's the best in the business for live shows.
He'll make you look like a million.
A million years old.
Is that how you feel?
Want your key back?
Val, are you clean?
Oh, my God.
I look like a junky, huh?
I've had no booze, no pills, no sniff and no smoke.
Except these damn things, that's all.
Can you look at me, babe?
How scared are you?
I'm terrified.
I can't do it, Kay.
I just don't know how to do it anymore.
I don't know what you have to do.
Sing, dance, be funny in front of 40 million people.
I'd do it myself if I had the time.
Come on.
And then we'll go to four after the crane shot.
Luther.
Mmm?
Take a look at this.
What's that?
Oh, boy.
Eddie, give me a tight two-shot on Kay and Valerie, would you?
Valerie Kirk.
Valerie Kirk?
Wait till I tell my wife.
Hey, boss, you want a willing worker?
Well, what are we waiting for?
And the lighting is terrific.
I don't believe it.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go to work.
Anything else, maestro?
Yeah.
How about walking on water?
Oh, yeah.
Valerie, I'm coming right down.
Wait for me.
Ma'am?
Lieutenant, you frightened me.
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
Your secretary said you were coming here.
I'll just take that.
Are you supposed to take that off?
Well, I thought I'd cheat for a while.
An hour won't hurt.
What do you think?
I think you're very attractive without it, but that's not a medical opinion.
Well, I'll tell you, ma'am, it's the nicest opinion I've heard yet.
She said, your secretary, that you used to live here.
Yes.
My mother raised three of us in this place.
I guess nothing sends you scurrying back to your roots like somebody else's death, does it?
Oh, I thought, ma'am, now that you have this new, important job you might have paid a visit just to see how far you've come.
Excuse me.
I'll just get another chair.
May I, ma'am?
Let's dine by candlelight, Lieutenant.
That'd be very nice, ma'am.
You know, I always knew this place was small but I never realized it was quite this tiny.
Four of us cramped in here.
Never a chance to be alone.
I took a trip a few years ago.
Took Mrs. Columbo back to the house where I grew up.
It looked all shrunken.
I had five brothers and one sister, Miss Freestone, and that was really terrific.
There was always someone around for company.
We were never lonely.
You're a very special man, Lieutenant.
You accept things as they are.
I try to change them.
That's to your credit, ma'am.
Your success and ambition and all.
Now, I'm supposed to ask you questions about all that.
You're supposed to?
Well, nobody told me to, but that's the way I'm supposed to do my job.
They're certainly not personal.
Whenever anyone says it's not personal, that's exactly when it's very personal.
It's not by choice, ma'am.
Sometimes I get all tense when I have to do it.
Well, then that's your problem, Lieutenant.
We have to do something to relieve some of that tension.
Oh.
Be careful, ma'am.
I won't touch your neck.
Just relax.
That's a real relief.
What I wanted to ask you, ma'am, would you have gotten this new job, in charge of West Coast production, if Mr. McAndrews hadn't been murdered?
Go on, ma'am.
You're not hurting me.
No.
I don't think Mark would have given me the job.
May I ask, ma'am, why you say that?
He never mentioned it.
Now the fact is, he never mentioned it to any of his executive staff.
But you were his main assistant.
Perhaps Mr. Flanagan had objections.
Well, I don't mean to pin you down, ma'am, but it was Mr. Flanagan who gave you your promotion.
Yes.
But it's not a permanent promotion, Lieutenant.
Remember that.
Well, Mr. Flanagan told me that it would have been okay with him if the murdered man had given you the job.
Then it was Mark's decision.
I hear those little voices going around in your ear, Lieutenant, asking could I possibly have miraculously murdered Mark for his job?
Oh, no, ma'am.
I don't think that at all.
You were up in the projection booth.
And I don't think people kill people for just a job.
Even an important job like yours.
A little lower down, ma'am, if you don't mind.
Either there was no motive at all, like in these crazy kind of murders that you read about in the newspaper, or there was a very good motive.
One that makes terrific sense.
And that's what keeps going around in my mind.
The motive.
No, I couldn't think those thoughts about you, Miss Freestone.
Not as long as all you had with Mr. McAndrews was a business relationship.
Well, I'm sure you've checked that out with the executive staff, haven't you, Lieutenant?
Not by choice, ma'am.
I wish I could help you, Lieutenant.
You have, Miss Freestone.
I'm gonna try sleeping tonight without this thing.
Well then, if you'll forgive me.
I've had enough of my olden times.
Yes, ma'am.
How do you like that?
I almost forgot again.
That item that I found on the victim's desk.
The one that I lost.
Well, I found it again.
It was a slip of paper.
Like a note that he was making to himself.
Some numbers and the capital letter "K."
Take a look at this, ma'am.
Maybe you can help me.
You see the capital letter "K"
and the numbers 280, 450 with a circle around it,
240 and 230.
Now, the "K" with those numbers.
Does that mean anything to you, ma'am?
Not a thing.
No.
You see, the numbers part,
I think that they form some kind of a pattern.
I think they got something in common and it's right on the tip of my tongue but I can't put my finger on it.
You can't help me?
Sorry.
Well, thanks a lot anyway.
What's your first name, ma'am?
Katherine.
But they call you Kay.
Yes.
And there's this capital letter "K" on the note.
Yes.
Does that ring a bell, ma'am?
No.
Nothing at all?
No, no help at all.
In this case, the "K" must simply be a "K."
Can't blame me for trying, ma'am.
You see, Mrs. Columbo, she never believed the doctor right from the start.
She claimed I was sleeping in a draft.
Well, last night she insisted upon closing the windows.
Well, I woke up this morning, I tell you, Sergeant, my neck felt terrific.
That's very good, Lieutenant.
I was getting so desperate that I was gonna go to this clinic where my brother-in-law goes for his back problem.
What they did, they said they had to deaden the nerves in his nose.
His nose, Lieutenant?
His nose.
They stuck a needle in his nose.
Sticking right out of his nose, like this.
That's how he had to walk around, with a needle in his nose.
What do you think of that, Sergeant?
That's very interesting, Lieutenant.
I think so, too.
Don't let me hold you up, Sergeant.
You go ahead.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Mearhead?
Oh, hi, Lieutenant.
Come on in.
I just wanted to say that I dropped the glove off for my nephew.
He figures it'll improve his editing 100%.
Well, you tell him he ought to become a surgeon.
That way he won't have to see so much blood.
You got any opinions about violence on television?
Well, I work nights a lot.
I wanna tell you something.
The other night, I come back from Film Shipping and the first thing I see is some guy blowing his brains out.
I mean, you think that's right?
I got a change coming up.
You know, it's crazy, Mr. Mearhead, but since I've been hanging around here I think I've become a button freak.
Buttons and switches.
Mmm-hmm.
You don't suppose I could try to make one of these changeovers myself?
I don't see why not.
All it is, is a writer watching an old movie.
All right, when you see your first flash, buttons up.
Button up.
Round before your dowser.
Dowser up.
On your second flash, Lieutenant, button here, button there, press.
Button, button.
Dowser down.
Down on dowser.
Left light off.
So, on the first flash, buttons up?
Buttons up.
And the dowser up.
Flash coming up.
First flash.
Flash up.
Second flash coming up.
Second flash.
Now the buttons go on the flash or before?
Did I miss?
It goes on the flash, Lieutenant.
On the flash.
There it is.
On the flash.
Okay.
What happened?
Walter, we lost our film in here.
What's going on?
Walter, can you hear me?
What the hell are you playing at in there?
Walter.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!
Can I talk to you?
Certainly, Sergeant.
Can we go in here?
I'd rather not.
McAndrews?
Uh-huh.
Got anything to go?
No, nothing to go.
All right.
Hold on.
I heard your promises last night and the night before.
Now, out of the carousel location by midnight tonight.
Kay, Luther's on one.
You have to talk to him.
What it is is a 90-minute melodrama.
Now, you get that on tape tonight, by midnight, or I am personally coming out there to pull the plug.
It's about Valerie.
Yes, Luther.
Valerie is gone.
What do you mean, she's gone?
I mean she's gone.
Gone is gone.
Up the chimney.
Nobody's seen her since we finished the dress rehearsal on the USO number.
And we go on the air in three hours and 20 minutes.
Well, did she leave the building?
Has anyone checked with the guards?
Kay, she left the building.
She's at your place.
Line four.
I'll get right back to you, Luther.
Valerie?
She's gone.
I'll get her back.
I'll get her back.
Valerie.
Val!
Valerie!
Did you call, madam?
You call me, "Madam," but never call me, "Late for dinner."
Come on.
Don't you touch me.
I don't want to!
I have to do the show.
I'm gonna do the show.
Luther's scared.
Luther's so scared.
Valerie's gonna do it live!
Kay, please.
Sure.
Please.
I hurt myself.
Me, too, kiddo.
Me, too.
I told you I couldn't do it!
Nobody listens.
They'll listen when I sing.
They'll listen when I sing.
They'll listen when I sing.
Please, give me a hug.
No more hugs.
We're fresh out of hugs.
I tried.
I'm just not good anymore.
Anymore.
Mr. Ames, please.
Henry, Valerie Kirk's at my apartment.
She won't be able to make the show tonight.
It doesn't matter right now.
Look, just get control of yourself.
We'll put in something else.
We'll put in a picture.
What else have we got?
Run The Professional.
It's the right length.
I got it made, didn't I?
Just tell the press that she fell down some stairs and hurt her leg.
What did you do?
What all good girls do.
The best I can.
Come on.
Give us a hug.
I really did it to you, didn't I, Kay?
I mean, I really did it.
It doesn't matter.
It's only a show.
I've got a million of them, kiddo.
Closed.
You promised.
What?
You promised.
Closed.
What?
Promised what?
My television set.
Lieutenant Columbo.
You brought it in this morning.
Yeah, I wanted it for tonight but I had to work late.
I'm working late myself on your television set.
Well, you see, sir, working nights, I don't get to see much television.
Mrs. Columbo, she does a lot of reading and she takes a lot of night school courses.
So the real TV fan in the house, that's my dog.
Boy, you got it going.
That's terrific.
He likes television.
He can't get enough of it.
You see that.
You like that?
He like it?
Yes, sir, I think he likes it.
How do you know he likes it?
He never saw nothing yet he didn't like.
Well, if he didn't like it, how would you know he didn't like it?
Well, he would look very bored, sir.
All droopy and listless.
I'll tell you the reason that we wanted to see TV tonight is, we wanted to see the second half of The Valerie Kirk Show.
Not on.
Not on?
I said it's not on.
This is the channel.
They got something else on instead.
Something called The Professional.
Oh, The Professional.
Would you believe I know the lady that made that show?
Not a bad picture.
Spy stuff.
Spies.
Your favorite.
You gonna start that again?
Come on, we gotta...
Up where the view is here.
All right, move over.
That's it.
There, are you comfortable?
Come on, up here where you can see.
Is that all right?
Sorry, Lieutenant.
Still not right.
Not bad, sir.
Not bad at all.
You just keep working.
I could fix you up with a terrific new one.
Under $400.
Your dog would love it.
No.
I gotta buy a new bumper for my car, maybe a new pair of shoes.
I think I'll pass.
Okay with you?
It's okay with him.
If it's okay with him, it's okay with me.
Good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, sir.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
New York.
Average rating 5.4, average share 9.3.
Los Angeles, a little worse.
You want the numbers?
No, and I don't want a hatpin in the ear, either.
We should probably get the nationals by tomorrow.
All right, it comes with the territory, Junior.
Wendy, you still on Flanagan?
He's been out all day.
I'll keep trying.
What time did the carousel location wrap up last night?
They didn't.
Get me that genius Benjamin.
Lieutenant.
You're working rather late tonight, aren't you?
Yes, ma'am.
Working late like a television executive.
That's a very impressive desk, ma'am.
You could run the world from a desk like that.
The world doesn't count.
Just the West Coast.
Through for the day, ma'am?
No.
Not quite.
Mr. McAndrews,
he wasn't married?
He wasn't married.
Was he ever married, ma'am?
I don't know.
Engaged?
Engaged?
Engaged, ma'am.
I don't know.
What about women?
Did he run around a lot?
Kay.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'll be moving in here tomorrow.
Would you please call the beach location and let them know that I'm coming out there tonight?
And then that would be all.
Okay.
Good night.
I was asking, ma'am, if he ran around with a lot of women.
I don't know.
He must've had companions.
Would you say that women found Mr. McAndrews attractive?
I'm sure his secretaries did.
You, personally, did you find him attractive?
Yes,
Mark was a very attractive man, in his way.
You're an attractive man, in your way, too.
I guess I told you that.
Yes, ma'am.
Please sit down.
Now, I ask people questions and they answer.
Now, I ask them the same question another time and they answer in a different way.
That's not because they're lying, ma'am.
I know that and I appreciate that.
There's been a death.
People are in shock, confusion.
People misremember.
They misspeak themselves.
Have I said something wrong?
Well, let's go all over again.
You said you knew nothing about how Mr. McAndrews spent his nights.
That had nothing to do with you?
Mmm-hmm.
Sometimes we dined together if we worked late.
And dates, girls.
Maybe somebody he lived with.
We never asked each other.
Well, that holds with what you said before.
But I'm surprised, ma'am.
And I don't mind telling you, I find it all very troubling.
Because I was at Mr. McAndrews' house yesterday.
The beach house.
And some cleaning was delivered, some slacks and this blazer.
And that's the problem, ma'am.
This blazer.
You see, I noticed that the buttons are on the wrong side.
It buttons right over left, the wrong side for a man's jacket that is, because this is a woman's blazer.
There's a tailor's label in it.
And I checked on that.
This jacket was made for you.
It's your jacket.
Would you like to try it on, ma'am?
No.
Well, since you were sending your cleaning out from Mr. McAndrews' house,
I can only assume...
All right, Lieutenant.
You've done very good work.
You've caught me in a lie.
I would say so, ma'am, yes.
Well, the corporation being what it is,
Mark and I didn't feel it would be very discrete to advertise our relationship.
Now, you can understand that, can't you?
Yes, ma'am, I can understand that.
But being discrete with the police, that's something else again.
Is it so really important to the police?
Well, you might have been able to tell us things.
Now, we're gonna have to talk about that.
All right.
I'm due on location now, so perhaps we can talk about it later on tomorrow.
As you say, you're not racing the clock and I am.
I guess another day won't make that much difference.
And I promise not to change my address or renew my passport or leave town
or ever tell another lie.
Well, you weren't even under oath, ma'am.
But what we have here, it's a matter of civic responsibility.
All the way down, ma'am?
All the way down.
I mean, if everybody kept their little secrets from the police, we'd be forever getting to the bottom of our cases.
My goodness.
I'm not supposed to do this in the elevator.
Excuse me?
I was talking about cooperation, ma'am.
I had a case once.
A man was cheating on his wife and he was a very important witness, but he was afraid to tell me.
I understand.
I hope you do, ma'am.
I apologize, Lieutenant.
I hope you forgive me.
Well, it's not my place, ma'am.
Oh, just so we have a meeting of minds.
Oh, about that note, the one that was on Mr. McAndrews' desk.
The one with all the numbers on it, the 450, the 280, the 230, the 250.
Nothing to worry about, ma'am.
It came to me.
Those were just some automobile models, different kinds of Mercedes cars.
So I guess, Mr. McAndrews, he must have been in the market for a new car.
Aren't you coming, ma'am?
No, there's a phone call I forgot to make.
Good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, ma'am.
Good night.
Miss Freestone, a young fellow from the agency left it.
I was supposed to give you these.
I don't know anything about it.
This...
And this.
And these two pages.
It only hurts for a little while, boys.
And they'll never miss what they don't know.
Now, at least you're back on schedule for tonight.
Where's the AD?
Kay, got a minute for me?
Mr. Flanagan.
Of course.
All right if we sit in the car?
If you like.
Oh, Carl.
Does this bother you?
No, not at all.
I want to talk about some of the difficulties you've been having.
Valerie Kirk.
I understand she's a close personal friend.
Yes, that's true.
I also understand that her director tried to warn you about her incompetence.
That's also true.
Well, we'll put that aside.
The decision to use The Professional as a replacement for Valerie's show,
I'm sure you know the ratings were very poor.
Well, under the circumstances...
Well, you created the circumstances.
Now, Kay, nobody knows better than you that The Professional cost us $1,600,000, including a second run.
Now, you wasted the first one.
You threw away an impressive film.
I was under the impression that you didn't like that film at all.
You had no right to make an assumption about what I like.
We'll...
We'll put that aside, too.
I've also been told that you're...
You're planning to...
To move into Mark's office tomorrow.
Why not?
I'll be needing more space.
The office comes with the job.
But you don't, Kay.
Nobody ever told you that your present duties were permanent.
Also, I question your taste in leaping so quickly behind a dead man's desk.
Well, I seem to have made quite a big hit.
All in all.
Now, you don't have to rush looking for a new position.
We'll, let's say, make it official at the end of the month?
I'll try to consult you in the press release.
Do you expect hysterics?
I hope not.
I'm as tough as you are.
I'll survive.
And you'll want me back.
I hope so.
Let's go to the party, Carl.
Dinner break, one half hour, folks.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Miss Freestone.
Search me.
We're on dinner break.
Miss Freestone!
Miss Freestone , ma'am, are you here?
Miss Freestone.
We're very busy where I am, Lieutenant.
You're going to have to forgive me.
We have problems.
Too many problems to speak now.
So I'm sorry, you'll have to forgive me.
I can't speak right now, Lieutenant.
Oh, I get it.
The cameras.
Oh, you're up in that control place.
You can see me on those big screens?
I'm right.
You can see me.
Right, ma'am?
Lieutenant, can we speak tomorrow at the office?
No, I...
I'll call you.
I definitely promise I'll do that, Lieutenant.
I'll call you.
Well, it's very important that we talk tonight, ma'am.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm afraid I'll have to insist, ma'am.
I really have to do that.
I can't accept that.
I can't speak now!
Please bear with me, ma'am.
It has to do with the car.
The 450SL, the silver one that's registered in your name.
The one that Mr. McAndrews bought.
That's all very puzzling, ma'am.
And there are other things.
There's your picture, The Professional, and this connection with whoever murdered Mr. McAndrews.
And there is a connection.
I'm pretty sure of that, ma'am.
I'm afraid it's necessary.
I know you're under a lot of pressure, ma'am, but there are these things that we should talk about tonight.
I don't like to have to talk to you this way, ma'am.
I know how you feel.
But it's very hard not being able to see you.
Ma'am?
I told you I have work to do, Lieutenant.
This show needs a lot of work.
The script needs work.
Ma'am,
like I asked you before, this new job you got, would you have it if Mr. McAndrews hadn't been murdered?
No.
I already told you, I don't think so.
I don't think so either.
Is that why he bought you the car?
Sort of a parting gift considering your relationship, like he was getting rid of you?
I find that very intrusive, Lieutenant.
And I don't think you have a right.
Oh, I have the right, ma'am.
But I understand your feelings.
Please, keep bearing with me, ma'am.
Sit down.
You know, maybe it was fate.
But I came within 30 seconds of not seeing your TV movie The Professional.
But I did see it, ma'am.
And I noticed something very peculiar.
So peculiar that I had the projectionist run it again today.
And that Technical Director that I met, he made this up for me on television tape.
It's your movie, ma'am.
The part where the fella's in the hotel room and he's gonna shoot himself.
Now, the Technical Director told me that there would be an eject button, blue.
Yes.
And a slot right here.
And an RT button one.
Here.
There it is ma'am.
Now, we'll just watch this together, ma'am.
There it is now, there.
There he is.
He's by the sink.
And there he's washing.
There, right there, you see the flash?
Yes, Lieutenant, it's a cue blip.
And now the second one.
There.
There's the second cue.
Now that's the cue for the projectionist to make his changeover.
Am I right, Miss Freestone?
Yes, Lieutenant, I'm very impressed.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't mean to interrupt.
Right there, that high shot where the man's lying on the hotel bed.
That's where the new reel begins.
Just watch it, ma'am.
And there, that's where the man commits suicide.
And that's what the projectionist saw right after he got back from the shipping room.
That's what Mr. Mearhead told me.
He came back into the booth, looked up and he saw a man blowing his brains out.
You had to make the changeover right before Mr. Mearhead got back from the shipping room.
Not a few minutes earlier, not sometime before,
like he thought.
I'm afraid, in this case,
Walter must be confused, Lieutenant.
He checked the footage counter before he left.
You must've fooled him about that, ma'am.
What I think,
I think you changed the footage counter to place yourself in the projection booth at the time of the murder.
But really, ma'am, you had time enough to leave the booth and get to Mr. McAndrews' office.
Just enough time.
Because when you rushed back to make the changeover, that's when you must've dropped this glove
by the projector.
It's Walter's glove.
Walter's projection booth.
I don't think you have a case against Walter.
No, ma'am.
Not the way he kept that booth, so immaculate and all.
I don't see him just throwing a glove on the floor.
And the lab says that this glove has powder burns on it.
And then there's the gun.
Mr. McAndrews' gun, the gun that murdered him.
The one that you put on the elevator.
Our people found it this afternoon.
And then we took a second gun, one that looked like this gun and we put it back on the elevator.
But we put it where it could be seen as if the continuous movement of the elevator had jiggled it so now it became visible.
Watch this, ma'am.
That's a TV picture of where we placed the second gun, just before you got on the elevator with me, ma'am.
There it is.
Now, there...
That's the way it looked right after you got back on the elevator and came off it.
And you'll notice, there is no gun.
Not anymore.
Because you got rid of it.
But this gun...
This is the gun that you murdered him with.
I see.
I'm sure you do, ma'am.
It's very odd.
They say there's a great sense of relief that comes when something like this is over.
I don't feel that at all.
Quite the opposite.
Will you be taking me?
Yes, ma'am, into town.
After that...
After that, I think I know what will happen.
I'll fight.
I'll survive.
I might even win.
Yes, ma'am.
Should we turn this off, ma'am?
It doesn't matter.
Yes, ma'am, the power shortage.
I think I know the right button.

KAY:
Where are the gun effects?
PRODUCER:
Bring 'em up, fellas.
MAN:
Looking for it.
KAY:
The music's too big.
Okay, now, when he gets into the alley, what I want to hear is just the pulse track on the music.
Let's take it from the top.
Okay, John?
Everything's okay with me.
I'm just the producer.
MAN:
Going back, Allen.
Kay, you're a very busy lady.
Why don't you get out of the grease pit and let me dub the film?
Because you boys at the studio get to have all the fun.
While we, over at the network, all we get to do is pay for these pictures and try to let you know what we want and how we want it.
How's that for a massage?
(BIRDS TWITTERING)

So how's the picture look?
Getting there.

He in?
Yeah, meeting.
MAN 1:
But New York is getting a little anxious.
MAN 2:
Do you really have to tell me that?
Gentlemen.
Kay.
Hello.
MARK:
Let me worry about New York.
Clay Gardner, what's he really gonna cost us?
Henry, did you check his agent out?
You want a price on Clay Gardner?
His agent just smiles and smiles.
Did you see the final dub?
Don't we wish.
At that studio, another three days.
Let me put it this way.
Can I show The Professional to the New York bunch, and will I want to?
Yes, you can show it and yes, you will want to.
You heard that Kay Freestone guarantees a 40 share.
Okay, friends, thank you much.
KAY:
Jonathan, fill me in.
I ran the network demographics on the six Clay Gardner movies.
Believe it or not, his strongest appeal... (DOOR SLAMMING)
(BUZZING)
Yes, Madge.
Mr. Flanagan in New York, on three.
Hello, Mark.
MARK:
Hello, Frank, how are you?
How's that great New York weather?
Well, how do you think?
It's still snowing.
I hate to tell you this but I went sailing yesterday.
Mark, how tough would it be to give up sailing in the winter?
What did you have in mind, Frank?
New York.
For how long?
Long as you want.
Forever.
FRANK:
It'll be out Tuesday, definite

(BIRDS CAWING)
Hey!
Breakfast!
Happy Sunday.
Well, Saturday wasrt too shabby.
You can read me the funnies.
Frank Flanagan called.
I got New York.
The whole damn network.
Baby, we did it, we did it, we did it.
When do we leave?
I want you to stay here, Kay.
Your job!
You are giving me the job?
What's going on here?
I can't give you the West Coast, babe.
Well, now.
I thought I'd earned something.
At what you do, Kay, you're the best there is.
You're the very best.
But you don't make decisions.
You make guesses.
There's a difference.
Guesses just aren't good enough.
But you'll learn.
Right.
Right.
I'm learning already.
Don't make it any tougher than it is.
(LAUGHING)
Poor baby.
Here I am worrying about myself.
Poor, precious Mark suffering through the awful truth.
Farewell, my dearest, the time has come.
Great secret lovers.
Super corporate team.
But onward and upward.
Whoop-dee-doo.
Kay in the end all we really owe each other is a little bit of affection.
Nobody was keeping tabs, were they?
So much for overtime, so much for double time, so much for playtime.
MARK:
Kay.
You wanna sue me?
Shoot me?
That make you feel better?
Right through the heart.
Make me a perfect murder, babe.
Kay.
You were supposed to find these out there.
A 450SL.
The silver one.
It's the one you always wanted.
It's still at the dealer showroom.
But it's registered in your name.
You can drive it home.
The license plate says, "Kay #1."
Well, that's a comment from the management.
Goodbye, Kay?
Sit up, Lieutenant.
I want you to relax.
Tilt your head back.
What...
What are you gonna do?
Just give your neck a little adjustment.
What do you mean by adjustment?
Don't worry, Lieutenant, it won't hurt at all.
I'll tell you, Sam, I don't think it hurts anymore.
It won't hurt at all.
Sam, it already doesn't hurt at all.
Relax.
Relax.

Sorry, Jonathan.
I'm going to need all those Clay Gardner demographs first thing in the morning.
Kay, that's gonna take all night.
Well, unless you'd like to explain your troubles to Mr. Flanagan, you'd better plan on spending the night.
Condolences, Junior.
Comes with the territory.
FRANK:
Well, who says Clay Gardner's ready to do TV?
PETE:
Just once I'd like to sit down to a hot meal.
MARK:
At $7 million a season, let's just say he might be tempted.
His agent take the hook yet?
No, I'm still setting it.
Planes don't count.
That's toy food.
It's really up to Frank.
What do you think, Pete?
Before, I got to be a VP...
Now I put it between bread.
We'll still come out of it.
Do you really want to lay out that kind of cash, Frank?
If we start paying $7 million, every actor we have will wanna renegotiate.
Clay Gardner isn't every actor.
Thank God.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Mr. Flanagan, gentlemen.
Kay.
Hi, Kay.
Soon as you've had your ice cream and cookies, we'll go to the movies.
All right, guys, let's go.
This way, gentlemen.
That's right.
What have you got?
I hope I'm gonna see you guys in my office later.
ALL:
We'll see you later.
Mark.
Let's roll the dice on Clay Gardner before I change my mind.
You got it.
FRANK:
Pete, listen, we're gonna go with Gardner.
So, first thing tomorrow set up a negotiating session.
I'll call Herbie Stone.
You all right?
I'm fine.
No, I mean really.
I mean, I'm really fine, Mark.
Good.
He can handle it.
Well, this picture is very much a Kay Freestone effort, I understand.
Oh, yes.
You'll find little flecks of my blood on each and every frame.
Gentlemen, I'll be in the booth.
Enjoy yourselves.
ALL:
Thank you.
Frank, do you really think that William Morris will cave-in that much on the price?
A million at least.
You got to be kidding it's seven.
Nobody believes seven.
Evening, Walter.
Hi, Kay.
VIP time, huh?
Oh, it's murder.
You got all nine reels here?
Ninety minutes, nine reels.
Okay.
You watching back here again, huh?
Walter,
I wrestled this bloody film through that nutty studio for six months.
If you so much as make one mistake in a changeover,
I'll kill you.
Yowsah, Miss Freestone.
Your film is gonna go through this gate at the incredible rate of 90 feet per minute.
You just watch this little old counter here.
And no sooner will this first reel finish up when I will see two little flashes of light out there in the upper right hand corner of your lovely picture.
And then I will, with lightning speed, switch over to this projector right here.
And not only will your big-shots not know that I have switched a reel, they'll not suspect one little old thing.
Bravo.
Kay, roll when you're ready.
All right.
Okay.
What's this called?
The Professional Mmm.

Not exactly the family hour, is it?
Walter, where are those other reels?
What other reels?
Screen tests that I ordered for Broad Land Flanagan might want to see them.
Oh, somebody goofed.
They must still be down in Shipping.
Well, you better go get them.
Four reels.
Well, there's a changeover coming in about two minutes.
I'll take care of the changeover.
You just get those reels for me, please.

What?
I'll be right in.
KAY ON SPEAKER:
Walter, no more picture tonight
(MUSIC STOPS)
Kay, I'm so terribly shocked.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, we're all very sorry.
I'm sure he'd be the first one to say there's no disrespect in our just doing our jobs.
What is there for today?
They asked for you in Mark's office.
Soon as you came in.
Kay, steady, love.
Good morning, ma'am.
Lieutenant Columbo, Homicide.
And you're Miss Freestone?
Yes, Lieutenant.
No disrespect intended, ma'am, but that's where Mr. McAndrews was lying, just like that.
When he was shot, that is.
Is there any way I can be of help, Lieutenant?
I don't believe so, ma'am.
Nice of you to offer.
We think it's a whiplash.
The doctors are making tests.
I'm so sorry.
No, I...
I meant, is there any way I can help you with your investigation?
Oh, the investigation.
Yes, ma'am, I think there is.
Now, I understand that you worked very closely with the victim.
Yes, I was his executive assistant.
Yes, ma'am.
And would you agree that these were his glasses?
They look like them, yes.
Then would you mind coming through that door, ma'am?
Excuse me?
If you would just go out and come through that door, please.
(DOOR CLOSING)
Come on in, ma'am.
COLUMBO:
Come on in.
Stop right there, ma'am.
Now, if you'll just hold out your arm.
Where?
Just point it at me, ma'am.
Like you were holding a pistol.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
My father wore glasses just like these.
And when I was a youngster, I used to like to put them on.
Made me feel like a grown-up.
There's something I wanted to ask you about Mr. McAndrews, ma'am.
An item that I found here on his desk a little piece of paper.
Well, it will turn up.
My mother used to grab the glasses off me.
"They're bad for your eyes," she used to say.
You know, in those days, everything was bad for your eyes.
Not wearing mittens was bad for your eyes.
Wearing rubbers in the house, that'd strike you blind on the spot.
I don't know what I did with that damn paper.
Well, it will turn up.
That must be very uncomfortable.
Ma'am?
Oh, this?
Well, it's better than a gallstone.
Did you ever have a gallstone, ma'am?
Whew!
No, I don't think so.
If there's nothing else, Lieutenant...
I've got 12 men searching, Lieutenant.
Is that enough?
As many as you can get, Sergeant.
We haven't found the weapon, ma'am.
We think it still might be on the premises.
I know there was a paper on this desk.
Oh, Sergeant Burke, this is Miss Freestone.
She was Mr. McAndrews' executive assistant.
Found you.
I think you're wanted in your office.
Something about Mr. Flanagan.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant, I think there's something you should see.
Would you mind coming with me?
Certainly, ma'am.
Keep searching, Sergeant.
BURKE:
Yes, sir.
We lost a hell of a lot more than manpower.
No, they don't know anything yet.
(KNOCKING)
Yes, I'll be staying around until we can get the pieces back together.
Kay, I hope I didn't take you away.
You all right?
Your men have everything they need, Lieutenant?
Well, it's very confusing, sir.
I mean, there were only so many people in the building last night.
You and your people, Miss Freestone and the projectionist and the young man working next door.
Every single one of them is accounted for.
With your terrific security and all, no one else could get in or out of the building.
So the question is, who killed Mr. McAndrews?
That's why I want you to look at these, Lieutenant.
You personally won this award yourself, ma'am?
Indeed she did, Lieutenant.
"For Best Documentary Production."
Well, you certainly are a very clever woman, ma'am.
That's why she's with us.
Very clever indeed.
Let's just say I work like an ox.
Please sit right here, Lieutenant.
Thank you, ma'am.
FRANK:
Kay.
Under the circumstances, I'm gonna ask something of you.
We'd like you to help us by taking over all of Mark's duties, at least for the time being.
Of course.
Anything I can do to help, Mr. Flanagan.
Good.
I knew I could count on you.
You can start by locking up Clay Gardner in The Broad Land
Oh, Mr. Flanagan, I wanted to talk to you about The Professional, the film last night?
I think we should talk about that some other time.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I'm sure it'll be off in a few days.
I call it weird, ma'am.
All these crazy crank letters.
Have you ever told the police about these threats?
Yes, I certainly have.
You'll notice that the network gets blamed for everything that's going, be it communism, fascism, atheism, abortion, sex, violence.
You name it.
Up, down or in the middle.
It's all the same thing.
"Support decency or we'll kill you."
Signed in blood.
So, naturally, when this happened, it occurred to me...
That one of these nuts slipped in here and killed Mr. McAndrews?
Well, other attempts have been made, twice on Mr. Flanagan.
I don't think so, ma'am.
Not in this case.
Granted, there's a lot of nuts running around, some of them dangerous.
Not in this case.
You seem very sure, Lieutenant.
That's because Mr. McAndrews recognized his murderer.
He knew the person who shot him.
I find that very hard to believe.
I don't wanna distress you, ma'am, but there's no doubt about it.
I know I had that paper somewhere.
Why is there no doubt about it?
We know the angle of the bullet, ma'am.
We know that the murderer didn't shoot from the door.
He entered the office.
I'd say he was 18 feet in by the time he pulled the trigger.
Well, why couldn't a stranger be 18 feet into a room?
Well, let me put it to you this way, ma'am.
If you were alone in a room at night, lying on a couch, and a stranger entered, wouldn't you take a good look at him?
Wouldrt you wanna see what he looked like?
Yes.
That's the point, ma'am.
Mr. McAndrews didn't bother to take a really good look.
It's these glasses, ma'am.
He had them up here on his forehead when he was shot.
When the murderer came into the room.
So Mr. McAndrews must've known exactly who that person was, or he would've pushed them down, like this.
Because with these type corrections, ma'am, these bifocals, this is the only way that Mr. McAndrews could see his killer.
If the killer was a stranger, that is.
Which he couldn't have been.
But I'll keep your theory in mind.
Interesting, isn't it, how you can work these small things out if you just think about it?
Like you got a tiny voice whispering right in your ear, trying to tell you who did it.
You're a very attentive listener, Lieutenant.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Why that's all we got to go on.
Listen and look, look and listen.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
WALTER:
You see, you watch your counter for the blip and then you stand by for the blip.
You mean to tell me that all these years, every time I took Mrs. Columbo to the theater, those flashes were on the screen?
They have been on the screen even before Mrs. Columbo, Lieutenant.
The upper right hand corner.
In a regular theater?
A regular theater.
If I go to the movies tonight, 8:30, down the block, a dollar and a half, and I walk in and sit down and watch the movie, you mean to tell me that I will see those flashes on the screen?
Right.
That goes to show you, you learn something new every day.
Now, the flashes tell the projectionist when he's supposed to change his reel.
All right, all right, watch.
Flash.
Now, you tell me when you see the second one.
Flash.
Mr. Mearhead,
I would say you did that like an artist.
Listen, you wanna see art, Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, this is art.
Isn't that remarkable?
You did that yourself?
That I did, sir.
When I was a kid, I used to build model airplanes.
I'd start them but I could never finish them.
I'd always wreck them.
Miss Freestone, she made the changeover last night when you went out for The Broad Land screen tests?
Yeah, about two minutes after I left.
I checked that counter.
You checked the counter,
Miss Freestone, she changed the projector.
Did Miss Freestone make the splice, too?
What splice?
You mean the film didn't break?
Isn't this one of those editor's gloves?
Right.
I mean, she could've fixed the film if anything happened, but nothing happened to the film.
You see,
I use these gloves because of the glue.
Well, thank you very much, sir.
Do you think it would be asking too much if I took one of these things for my nephew?
Sure, help yourself.
The kid's 15-years-old and he sold all his stereo stuff to make eight-millimeter movies.
When I was a kid in my neighborhood, we had heroes.
DiMaggio, Rizzuto...
You know who he's got on the wall?
Francis Ford Coppola.
(EXCLAIMING)
Sorry, ma'am.
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Oh, Walter, you can send those test reels back to Shipping anytime.
Oh, those tests, ma'am, the tests, they've already gone back to Shipping.
I spoke to the gentleman in charge.
Oh.
Fine, then.
COLUMBO:
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
About those tests that you sent out for last night.
Those were tests for a new series called The Broad Land?
Yes, Lieutenant, they were talent tests.
Yes, well there's something that I don't understand, ma'am, and maybe I should...
I probably should...
Lord knows I'm not the brightest guy on the force.
Another detective, he could cut right through all this.
I understand, Lieutenant.
Just ask your questions.
That's the problem, ma'am.
When I ask the questions, I know I'm putting you on the spot.
It's perfectly all right, Lieutenant.
It's your job.
I appreciate that.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
If only more people felt that way.
The question is...
Mr. Flanagan says that he already approved Clay Gardner to star in that new series.
So I had to ask myself, if he already approved him, why would you wanna show him more tests?
You see my problem, ma'am?
Yes, I do, and I wondered exactly the same thing myself.
Did you?
Mmm-hmm.
This time I think you're listening to the wrong little voice in your ear, Lieutenant.
I was just following instructions.
Mr. Flanagars instructions?
Mr. McAndrews' instructions.
Written instructions, ma'am?
Verbal instructions, Lieutenant.
I see.
Well, we certainly can't ask Mr. McAndrews, can we?
(ELEVATOR DINGING)
I'm afraid I do have to go, Lieutenant.
COLUMBO:
Oh, ma'am.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I know you're pressed.
I don't wanna hold you up.
Can we walk and talk?
Let's.
I know that Mr. McAndrews was an important executive, and I know that CNC is a big television network.
But I have no idea what he did all day and night, from what I can see around here.
Well, I can hardly speak for his nights, Lieutenant.
I didn't mean to imply, ma'am.
His days were mostly like mine.
We run a fire department around here.
Do you want to look at some of the flames?
Flames, ma'am?
Yes, mostly we put out fires.
LUTHER:
Nancy, monitor two.
NANC Y:
One, please
LUTHER:
Thank you, sweetheart.
Yeah, now, that's the angle I want for the third position.
MAN:
Looking nice kids.
Looking very good.
Start from the top and I'll watch it up here.
Oh, Kay, we've already lost two hours.
Where is she?
Luther will tell you.
Oh, Lieutenant, I'll be busy for a minute.
Just help yourself.
Don't worry about me, ma'am.
(SHUSHING)
Luther?
LUTHER:
Coming down.
You can take a break now, Nancy.
Thanks.
NANCY:
All right, everybody, five minutes, please.
Where are we?
Replace her, Kay.
Valerie?
She's never gonna make it.
Not a live show.
Not in this world.
Oh, come on, we're on tomorrow night.
She's terrified, she's hysterical.
She's losing her mind.
I mean, she doesn't even understand that this is not an MGM sound stage 20 years ago.
She hates the blocking, she hates the camera, she hates me.
You, I don't know about.
Look, a few times a day she'll have a nice rush of confidence for 10 minutes and then she'll remember it's a live show, bite one of the dancers on the leg and run to her dressing room and hide.
Aside from all that, her work is lousy.
Where is she?
Dressing room.
Luther, is she on anything?
Oh, please.
COLUMBO:
You mean it's gonna be live TV, just the way it used to be?
TECHNICAL DIRECTOR:
A little bit better, Lieutenant, we hope.
This is where the director will sit.
Here, sit down.
This is a technical director's console.
Does that bother you?
(STAMMERING) That's just whiplash.
I mean, I think it's a whiplash.
My doctor thinks it's a whiplash.
The chiropractor, he thinks I just got a bad massage.
And my wife's osteopath, he thinks it might be a back problem.
It doesn't look like a back problem.
That's what the orthopedic man said.
Listen, all these screens for just one show?
That's a line monitor.
That's what's going on the air.
Preview monitor is what the director wants up next and those are what the four cameras see.
I do the switching.
Hey, all these beautiful machines in here, all these buttons to push.
I know it costs millions and I know that everybody works very hard.
But I gotta tell you the truth.
To me, it looks like fun.
It is, but I wouldn't swear to it in court.
And Miss Freestone, she understands all about this, too?
I'll tell you about that.
If there's one thing worse than a television lady who thinks she knows everything, it's a television lady who knows everything.
I'll see you later, Lieutenant.

Whose side are you on?
Whose do you think?
Prove it.
You can keep the key to my apartment.
Oh, Kay.
Give me a hug.
Oh, I thought you'd never get here.
Did Luther get over his snit yet?
How about yours?
Big deal.
I tried to tell that genius where to put my key light and the roof fell in.
Big man from New York.
Luther's very good.
He's the best in the business for live shows.
He'll make you look like a million.
A million years old.
Is that how you feel?
Want your key back?
Val, are you clean?
Oh, my God.
I look like a junky, huh?
I've had no booze, no pills, no sniff and no smoke.
Except these damn things, that's all.
(SOBBING)
Can you look at me, babe?
How scared are you?
I'm terrified.
I can't do it, Kay.
I just don't know how to do it anymore.
I don't know what you have to do.
Sing, dance, be funny in front of 40 million people.
I'd do it myself if I had the time.
Come on.
LUTHER:
And then we'll go to four after the crane shot.
Luther.
Mmm?
Take a look at this.
What's that?
LUTHER:
Oh, boy.
Eddie, give me a tight two-shot on Kay and Valerie, would you?
Valerie Kirk.
Valerie Kirk?
Wait till I tell my wife.
Hey, boss, you want a willing worker?
Well, what are we waiting for?
And the lighting is terrific
I don't believe it.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go to work

Yeah How about walking on water?
Oh, yeah

I'll just take that.
Are you supposed to take that off?
Well, I thought I'd cheat for a while.
An hour won't hurt.
What do you think?
I think you're very attractive without it, but that's not a medical opinion.
Well, I'll tell you, ma'am, it's the nicest opinion I've heard yet.
She said, your secretary, that you used to live here.
Yes.
My mother raised three of us in this place.
I guess nothing sends you scurrying back to your roots like somebody else's death, does it?
Oh, I thought, ma'am, now that you have this new, important job you might have paid a visit just to see how far you've come.
Excuse me.
I'll just get another chair.
May I, ma'am?
Let's dine by candlelight, Lieutenant.
That'd be very nice, ma'am.
You know, I always knew this place was small but I never realized it was quite this tiny.
Four of us cramped in here.
Never a chance to be alone.
I took a trip a few years ago.
Took Mrs. Columbo back to the house where I grew up.
It looked all shrunken.
I had five brothers and one sister, Miss Freestone, and that was really terrific.
There was always someone around for company.
We were never lonely.
You're a very special man, Lieutenant.
You accept things as they are.
I try to change them.
That's to your credit, ma'am.
Your success and ambition and all.
Now, I'm supposed to ask you questions about all that.
You're supposed to?
Well, nobody told me to, but that's the way I'm supposed to do my job.
They're certainly not personal.
Whenever anyone says it's not personal, that's exactly when it's very personal.
It's not by choice, ma'am.
Sometimes I get all tense when I have to do it.
Well, then that's your problem, Lieutenant.
We have to do something to relieve some of that tension.
Oh.
Be careful, ma'am.
I won't touch your neck.
Just relax.
(GROANING)
That's a real relief.
What I wanted to ask you, ma'am, would you have gotten this new job, in charge of West Coast production, if Mr. McAndrews hadrt been murdered?
Go on, ma'am.
You're not hurting me.
No.
I don't think Mark would have given me the job.
May I ask, ma'am, why you say that?
He never mentioned it.
Now the fact is, he never mentioned it to any of his executive staff.
But you were his main assistant.
Perhaps Mr. Flanagan had objections.
Well, I don't mean to pin you down, ma'am, but it was Mr. Flanagan who gave you your promotion.
Yes.
But it's not a permanent promotion, Lieutenant.
Remember that.
Well, Mr. Flanagan told me that it would have been okay with him if the murdered man had given you the job.
Then it was Mark's decision.
I hear those little voices going around in your ear, Lieutenant, asking could I possibly have miraculously murdered Mark for his job?
Oh, no, ma'am.
I don't think that at all.
You were up in the projection booth.
And I don't think people kill people for just a job.
Even an important job like yours.
A little lower down, ma'am, if you don't mind.
Either there was no motive at all, like in these crazy kind of murders that you read about in the newspaper, or there was a very good motive.
One that makes terrific sense.
And that's what keeps going around in my mind.
The motive.
No, I couldn't think those thoughts about you, Miss Freestone.
Not as long as all you had with Mr. McAndrews was a business relationship.
Well, I'm sure you've checked that out with the executive staff, haven't you, Lieutenant?
Not by choice, ma'am.
I wish I could help you, Lieutenant.
You have, Miss Freestone.
I'm gonna try sleeping tonight without this thing.
Well then, if you'll forgive me.
I've had enough of my olden times.
Yes, ma'am.
How do you like that?
I almost forgot again.
That item that I found on the victim's desk.
The one that I lost.
Well, I found it again.
It was a slip of paper.
Like a note that he was making to himself.
Some numbers and the capital letter "K."
Take a look at this, ma'am.
Maybe you can help me.
COLUMBO:
You see the capital letter "K"
and the numbers 280, 450 with a circle around it,
240 and 230.
Now, the "K" with those numbers.
Does that mean anything to you, ma'am?
Not a thing.
No.
You see, the numbers part,
I think that they form some kind of a pattern.
I think they got something in common and it's right on the tip of my tongue but I can't put my finger on it.
You can't help me?
Sorry.
Well, thanks a lot anyway.
What's your first name, ma'am?
Katherine.
But they call you Kay.
Yes.
And there's this capital letter "K" on the note.
Yes.
Does that ring a bell, ma'am?
No.
Nothing at all?
No, no help at all.
In this case, the "K" must simply be a "K."
Can't blame me for trying, ma'am.
COLUMBO:
You see, Mrs. Columbo, she never believed the doctor right from the start.
She claimed I was sleeping in a draft.
Well, last night she insisted upon closing the windows.
Well, I woke up this morning, I tell you, Sergeant, my neck felt terrific.
That's very good, Lieutenant.
I was getting so desperate that I was gonna go to this clinic where my brother-in-law goes for his back problem.
What they did, they said they had to deaden the nerves in his nose.
His nose, Lieutenant?
His nose.
They stuck a needle in his nose.
Sticking right out of his nose, like this.
That's how he had to walk around, with a needle in his nose.
What do you think of that, Sergeant?
That's very interesting, Lieutenant.
I think so, too.
Don't let me hold you up, Sergeant.
You go ahead.
Yes, sir.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
Mr. Mearhead?
Oh, hi, Lieutenant.
Come on in.
I just wanted to say that I dropped the glove off for my nephew.
He figures it'll improve his editing 100%.
Well, you tell him he ought to become a surgeon.
That way he won't have to see so much blood.
You got any opinions about violence on television?
Well, I work nights a lot.
I wanna tell you something.
The other night, I come back from Film Shipping and the first thing I see is some guy blowing his brains out.
I mean, you think that's right?
I got a change coming up.
You know, it's crazy, Mr. Mearhead, but since I've been hanging around here I think I've become a button freak.
Buttons and switches.
Mmm-hmm.
You don't suppose I could try to make one of these changeovers myself?
I don't see why not.
All it is, is a writer watching an old movie.
All right, when you see your first flash, buttons up.
Button up.
Round before your dowser.
Dowser up.
On your second flash, Lieutenant, button here, button there, press.
Button, button.
Dowser down.
Down on dowser.
Left light off.
So, on the first flash, buttons up?
Buttons up.
And the dowser up.
WALTER:
Flash coming up.
COLUMBO:
First flash.
Flash up.
Second flash coming up.
Second flash.
Now the buttons go on the flash or before?
Did I miss?
It goes on the flash, Lieutenant.
On the flash.
There it is.
On the flash.
Okay.
What happened?

Got anything to go?
No, nothing to go.
All right.
Hold on.
I heard your promises last night and the night before.
Now, out of the carousel location by midnight tonight.
Kay, Luther's on one.
You have to talk to him.
What it is is a 90-minute melodrama.
Now, you get that on tape tonight, by midnight, or I am personally coming out there to pull the plug.
It's about Valerie.
Yes, Luther.
Valerie is gone.
What do you mean, she's gone?
I mean she's gone.
Gone is gone.
Up the chimney.
Nobody's seen her since we finished the dress rehearsal on the USO number.
And we go on the air in three hours and 20 minutes.
(GRUNTING)
Well, did she leave the building?
Has anyone checked with the guards?
Kay, she left the building.
She's at your place.
Line four.
I'll get right back to you, Luther.
Valerie?
She's gone.
I'll get her back.
I'll get her back.
Valerie.
Val!
Valerie!
Did you call, madam?
You call me, "Madam," but never call me, "Late for dinner."
(VALERIE LAUGHING)
Come on.
Don't you touch me.
I don't want to!
I have to do the show.
I'm gonna do the show.
Luther's scared.
Luther's so scared.
Valerie's gonna do it live!
(VALERIE GROANING)
Kay, please.
Sure.
Please.
I hurt myself.
Me, too, kiddo.
Me, too.
I told you I couldn't do it!
Nobody listens.
They'll listen when I sing.
They'll listen when I sing.
They'll listen when I sing.
(VALERIE MOANING)
Please, give me a hug.
No more hugs.
We're fresh out of hugs.
I tried.
I'm just not good anymore.
Anymore.
Mr. Ames, please.
Henry, Valerie Kirk's at my apartment.
She won't be able to make the show tonight.
It doesn't matter right now.
Look, just get control of yourself.
We'll put in something else.
We'll put in a picture.
What else have we got?
Run The Professional It's the right length.
I got it made, didn't I?
Just tell the press that she fell down some stairs and hurt her leg.
What did you do?
What all good girls do.
The best I can.
Come on.
Give us a hug.
I really did it to you, didn't I, Kay?
I mean, I really did it.
It doesn't matter.
It's only a show.
I've got a million of them, kiddo.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Closed.
You promised.
What?
You promised.
Closed.
What?
Promised what?
My television set.
Lieutenant Columbo.
You brought it in this morning.
(BELL DINGING)
Yeah, I wanted it for tonight but I had to work late.
I'm working late myself on your television set.
Well, you see, sir, working nights, I don't get to see much television.
Mrs. Columbo, she does a lot of reading and she takes a lot of night school courses.
So the real TV fan in the house, that's my dog.
(MOOD Y JAZZ PLAYING ON T V)
Boy, you got it going.
That's terrific.
He likes television.
He can't get enough of it.
You see that.
You like that?
He like it?
Yes, sir, I think he likes it.
How do you know he likes it?
He never saw nothing yet he didn't like.
Well, if he didn't like it, how would you know he didn't like it?
Well, he would look very bored, sir.
All droopy and listless.
I'll tell you the reason that we wanted to see TV tonight is, we wanted to see the second half of The Valerie Kirk Show
Not on.
Not on?
I said it's not on.
This is the channel.
They got something else on instead.
Something called The Professional
Oh, The Professional
Would you believe I know the lady that made that show?
Not a bad picture.
Spy stuff.
Spies.
Your favorite.
You gonna start that again?
Come on, we gotta...
Up where the view is here.
All right, move over.
That's it.
There, are you comfortable?
Come on, up here where you can see.
Is that all right?
(GUN FIRING ON T V)
Sorry, Lieutenant.
Still not right.
Not bad, sir.
Not bad at all.
You just keep working.
I could fix you up with a terrific new one.
Under $400.
Your dog would love it.
No.
I gotta buy a new bumper for my car, maybe a new pair of shoes.
I think I'll pass.
Okay with you?
It's okay with him.
If it's okay with him, it's okay with me.
Good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, sir.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.

I'll keep trying.

They didn't.
Get me that genius Benjamin.
(COLUMBO STRIKING A MATCH)
Lieutenant.
You're working rather late tonight, aren't you?
Yes, ma'am.
Working late like a television executive.
That's a very impressive desk, ma'am.
You could run the world from a desk like that.
The world doesn't count.
Just the West Coast.
Through for the day, ma'am?
No.
Not quite.
Mr. McAndrews,
he wasrt married?
He wasrt married.
Was he ever married, ma'am?
I don't know.
Engaged?
Engaged?
Engaged, ma'am.
I don't know.
What about women?
Did he run around a lot?
MADGE:
Kay.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'll be moving in here tomorrow.
Would you please call the beach location and let them know that I'm coming out there tonight?
And then that would be all.
Okay.
Good night.
I was asking, ma'am, if he ran around with a lot of women.
I don't know.
He must've had companions.
Would you say that women found Mr. McAndrews attractive?
I'm sure his secretaries did.
You, personally, did you find him attractive?
Yes,
Mark was a very attractive man, in his way.
You're an attractive man, in your way, too.
I guess I told you that.
Yes, ma'am.
Please sit down.
Now, I ask people questions and they answer.
Now, I ask them the same question another time and they answer in a different way.
That's not because they're lying, ma'am.
I know that and I appreciate that.
There's been a death.
People are in shock, confusion.
People misremember.
They misspeak themselves.
Have I said something wrong?
Well, let's go all over again.
You said you knew nothing about how Mr. McAndrews spent his nights.
That had nothing to do with you?
Mmm-hmm.
Sometimes we dined together if we worked late.
And dates, girls.
Maybe somebody he lived with.
We never asked each other.
Well, that holds with what you said before.
But I'm surprised, ma'am.
And I don't mind telling you, I find it all very troubling.
Because I was at Mr. McAndrews' house yesterday.
The beach house.
And some cleaning was delivered, some slacks and this blazer.
And that's the problem, ma'am.
This blazer.
You see, I noticed that the buttons are on the wrong side.
It buttons right over left, the wrong side for a mars jacket that is, because this is a womars blazer.
There's a tailor's label in it.
And I checked on that.
This jacket was made for you.
It's your jacket.
Would you like to try it on, ma'am?
No.
Well, since you were sending your cleaning out from Mr. McAndrews' house,
I can only assume...
All right, Lieutenant.
You've done very good work.
You've caught me in a lie.
I would say so, ma'am, yes.
Well, the corporation being what it is,
Mark and I didn't feel it would be very discrete to advertise our relationship.
Now, you can understand that, can't you?
Yes, ma'am, I can understand that.
But being discrete with the police, that's something else again.
Is it so really important to the police?
Well, you might have been able to tell us things.
Now, we're gonna have to talk about that.
All right.
I'm due on location now, so perhaps we can talk about it later on tomorrow.
As you say, you're not racing the clock and I am.
I guess another day won't make that much difference.
And I promise not to change my address or renew my passport or leave town
or ever tell another lie.
Well, you werert even under oath, ma'am.
But what we have here, it's a matter of civic responsibility.
All the way down, ma'am?
All the way down.
I mean, if everybody kept their little secrets from the police, we'd be forever getting to the bottom of our cases.
My goodness.
I'm not supposed to do this in the elevator.
Excuse me?
I was talking about cooperation, ma'am.
I had a case once.
A man was cheating on his wife and he was a very important witness, but he was afraid to tell me.
I understand.
I hope you do, ma'am.
I apologize, Lieutenant.
I hope you forgive me.
Well, it's not my place, ma'am.
Oh, just so we have a meeting of minds.
Oh, about that note, the one that was on Mr. McAndrews' desk.
The one with all the numbers on it, the 450, the 280, the 230, the 250.
Nothing to worry about, ma'am.
It came to me.
Those were just some automobile models, different kinds of Mercedes cars.
So I guess, Mr. McAndrews, he must have been in the market for a new car.
Arert you coming, ma'am?
No, there's a phone call I forgot to make.
Good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, ma'am.

Where's the AD?
Kay, got a minute for me?
Mr. Flanagan.
Of course.
All right if we sit in the car?
If you like.
Oh, Carl.
Does this bother you?
No, not at all.
I want to talk about some of the difficulties you've been having.
Valerie Kirk.
I understand she's a close personal friend.
Yes, that's true.
I also understand that her director tried to warn you about her incompetence.
That's also true.
Well, we'll put that aside.
The decision to use The Professional as a replacement for Valerie's show,
I'm sure you know the ratings were very poor.
Well, under the circumstances...
Well, you created the circumstances.
Now, Kay, nobody knows better than you that The Professional cost us $1,600,000, including a second run.
Now, you wasted the first one.
You threw away an impressive film.
I was under the impression that you didn't like that film at all.
You had no right to make an assumption about what I like.
We'Il...
We'll put that aside, too.
I've also been told that you're...
You're planning to...
To move into Mark's office tomorrow.
Why not?
I'll be needing more space.
The office comes with the job.
But you don't, Kay.
Nobody ever told you that your present duties were permanent.
Also, I question your taste in leaping so quickly behind a dead mars desk.
Well, I seem to have made quite a big hit.
All in all.
Now, you don't have to rush looking for a new position.
We'II, let's say, make it official at the end of the month?
I'll try to consult you in the press release.
Do you expect hysterics?
I hope not.
I'm as tough as you are.
I'll survive.
And you'll want me back.
I hope so.

We're very busy where I am, Lieutenant.
You're going to have to forgive me.
We have problems.
Too many problems to speak now.
KAY ON SPEAKER:
So I'm sorry, you'll have to forgive me
I can't speak right now, Lieutenant
Oh, I get it.
The cameras.
Oh, you're up in that control place.
You can see me on those big screens?
I'm right You can see me Right, ma'am?
Lieutenant, can we speak tomorrow at the office?
No, I...
I'll call you.
I definitely promise I'll do that, Lieutenant.
I'll call you.
Well, it's very important that we talk tonight, ma'am
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm afraid I'll have to insist, ma'am I really have to do that
I can't accept that.
I can't speak now!
Please bear with me, ma'am
It has to do with the car
The 450SL, the silver one that's registered in your name
The one that Mr McAndrews bought That's all very puzzling, ma'am
And there are other things
There's your picture, The Professional, and this connection with whoever murdered Mr McAndrews
And there is a connection I'm pretty sure of that, ma'am
I'm afraid it's necessary
I know you're under a lot of pressure, ma'am, but there are these things that we should talk about tonight
I don't like to have to talk to you this way, ma'am
I know how you feel
But it's very hard not being able to see you
(KAY SCREAMING)
Ma'am?
I told you I have work to do, Lieutenant.
This show needs a lot of work.
The script needs work.
Ma'am,
like I asked you before, this new job you got, would you have it if Mr. McAndrews hadrt been murdered?
No.
I already told you, I don't think so.
I don't think so either.
Is that why he bought you the car?
Sort of a parting gift considering your relationship, like he was getting rid of you?
I find that very intrusive, Lieutenant.
And I don't think you have a right.
Oh, I have the right, ma'am.
But I understand your feelings.
Please, keep bearing with me, ma'am.
Sit down.
You know, maybe it was fate.
But I came within 30 seconds of not seeing your TV movie The Professional
But I did see it, ma'am.
And I noticed something very peculiar.
So peculiar that I had the projectionist run it again today.
And that Technical Director that I met, he made this up for me on television tape.
It's your movie, ma'am.
The part where the fella's in the hotel room and he's gonna shoot himself.
Now, the Technical Director told me that there would be an eject button, blue.
Yes.
And a slot right here.
And an RT button one.
Here.
There it is ma'am.
(MOOD Y JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
Now, we'll just watch this together, ma'am.
There it is now, there.
There he is.
He's by the sink.
And there he's washing.
There, right there, you see the flash?
Yes, Lieutenant, it's a cue blip.
And now the second one.
There.
There's the second cue.
Now that's the cue for the projectionist to make his changeover.
Am I right, Miss Freestone?
Yes, Lieutenant, I'm very impressed.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't mean to interrupt.
Right there, that high shot where the mars lying on the hotel bed.
That's where the new reel begins.
Just watch it, ma'am.
(GUN FIRING ON T V)
And there, that's where the man commits suicide.
And that's what the projectionist saw right after he got back from the shipping room.
That's what Mr. Mearhead told me.
He came back into the booth, looked up and he saw a man blowing his brains out.
You had to make the changeover right before Mr. Mearhead got back from the shipping room.
Not a few minutes earlier, not sometime before,
like he thought.
I'm afraid, in this case,
Walter must be confused, Lieutenant.
He checked the footage counter before he left.
You must've fooled him about that, ma'am.
What I think,
I think you changed the footage counter to place yourself in the projection booth at the time of the murder.
But really, ma'am, you had time enough to leave the booth and get to Mr. McAndrews' office.
Just enough time.
Because when you rushed back to make the changeover, that's when you must've dropped this glove
by the projector.
It's Walter's glove.
Walter's projection booth.
I don't think you have a case against Walter.
No, ma'am.
Not the way he kept that booth, so immaculate and all.
I don't see him just throwing a glove on the floor.
And the lab says that this glove has powder burns on it.
And then there's the gun.
Mr. McAndrews' gun, the gun that murdered him.
The one that you put on the elevator.
Our people found it this afternoon.
And then we took a second gun, one that looked like this gun and we put it back on the elevator.
But we put it where it could be seen as if the continuous movement of the elevator had jiggled it so now it became visible.
Watch this, ma'am.
That's a TV picture of where we placed the second gun, just before you got on the elevator with me, ma'am.
There it is.
Now, there...
That's the way it looked right after you got back on the elevator and came off it.
And you'll notice, there is no gun.
Not anymore.
Because you got rid of it.
But this gun...
This is the gun that you murdered him with.
I see.
I'm sure you do, ma'am.
It's very odd.
They say there's a great sense of relief that comes when something like this is over.
I don't feel that at all.
Quite the opposite.
Will you be taking me?
Yes, ma'am, into town.
After that...
After that, I think I know what will happen.
I'll fight.
I'll survive.
I might even win.
Yes, ma'am.
Should we turn this off, ma'am?
It doesn't matter.
Yes, ma'am, the power shortage.
I think I know the right button.

I'm just the producer.
MAN:
Going back, Allen.
Kay, you're a very busy lady.
Why don't you get out of the grease pit and let me dub the film?
Because you boys at the studio get to have all the fun.
While we, over at the network, all we get to do is pay for these pictures and try to let you know what we want and how we want it.
How's that for a massage?
(BIRDS TWITTERING)
(TYPEWRITER CLACKING)
(PHONE RINGING)
So how's the picture look?
Getting there.
Like pulling teeth.
Hmm.
Lunch?
Mmm-hmm.
Shrimp Salad.
Peace.
Peace.
He in?
Yeah, meeting.
MAN 1:
But New York is getting a little anxious.
MAN 2:
Do you really have to tell me that?
Gentlemen.
Kay.
Hello.
MARK:
Let me worry about New York.
Clay Gardner, what's he really gonna cost us?
Henry, did you check his agent out?
You want a price on Clay Gardner?
His agent just smiles and smiles.
Did you see the final dub?
Don't we wish.
At that studio, another three days.
Let me put it this way.
Can I show The Professional to the New York bunch, and will I want to?
Yes, you can show it and yes, you will want to.
You heard that Kay Freestone guarantees a 40 share.
Okay, friends, thank you much.
KAY:
Jonathan, fill me in.
I ran the network demographics on the six Clay Gardner movies.
Believe it or not, his strongest appeal... (DOOR SLAMMING)
(BUZZING)
Yes, Madge.
Mr. Flanagan in New York, on three.
Hello, Mark.
MARK:
Hello, Frank, how are you?
How's that great New York weather?
Well, how do you think?
It's still snowing.
I hate to tell you this but I went sailing yesterday.
Mark, how tough would it be to give up sailing in the winter?
What did you have in mind, Frank?
New York.
For how long?
Long as you want.
Forever.
FRANK:
It'll be out Tuesday, definite.
(SINGING) Hated California It's cold and it's damp
(HUMMING)
(BIRDS CAWING)
Hey!
Breakfast!
Happy Sunday.
Well, Saturday wasrt too shabby.
You can read me the funnies.
Frank Flanagan called.
I got New York.
The whole damn network.
Baby, we did it, we did it, we did it.
When do we leave?
I want you to stay here, Kay.
Your job!
You are giving me the job?
What's going on here?
I can't give you the West Coast, babe.
Well, now.
I thought I'd earned something.
At what you do, Kay, you're the best there is.
You're the very best.
But you don't make decisions.
You make guesses.
There's a difference.
Guesses just aren't good enough.
But you'll learn.
Right.
Right.
I'm learning already.
Don't make it any tougher than it is.
(LAUGHING)
Poor baby.
Here I am worrying about myself.
Poor, precious Mark suffering through the awful truth.
Farewell, my dearest, the time has come.
Great secret lovers.
Super corporate team.
But onward and upward.
Whoop-dee-doo.
Kay in the end all we really owe each other is a little bit of affection.
Nobody was keeping tabs, were they?
So much for overtime, so much for double time, so much for playtime.
MARK:
Kay.
You wanna sue me?
Shoot me?
That make you feel better?
Right through the heart.
Make me a perfect murder, babe.
Kay.
You were supposed to find these out there.
A 450SL.
The silver one.
It's the one you always wanted.
It's still at the dealer showroom.
But it's registered in your name.
You can drive it home.
The license plate says, "Kay #1."
Well, that's a comment from the management.
Goodbye, Kay?
Sit up, Lieutenant.
I want you to relax.
Tilt your head back.
What...
What are you gonna do?
Just give your neck a little adjustment.
What do you mean by adjustment?
Don't worry, Lieutenant, it won't hurt at all.
I'll tell you, Sam, I don't think it hurts anymore.
It won't hurt at all.
Sam, it already doesn't hurt at all.
Relax.
Relax.
(CRACKING)
KAY ON RECORDER:
You have one minute and 20 seconds.

Oh, hello, Kay.
(TYPEWRITER CLACKING)
Sorry, Jonathan.
I'm going to need all those Clay Gardner demographs first thing in the morning.
Kay, that's gonna take all night.
Well, unless you'd like to explain your troubles to Mr. Flanagan, you'd better plan on spending the night.
Condolences, Junior.
Comes with the territory.
FRANK:
Well, who says Clay Gardner's ready to do TV?
PETE:
Just once I'd like to sit down to a hot meal.
MARK:
At $7 million a season, let's just say he might be tempted.
His agent take the hook yet?
No, I'm still setting it.
Planes don't count.
That's toy food.
It's really up to Frank.
What do you think, Pete?
Before, I got to be a VP...
Now I put it between bread.
We'll still come out of it.
Do you really want to lay out that kind of cash, Frank?
If we start paying $7 million, every actor we have will wanna renegotiate.
Clay Gardner isn't every actor.
Thank God.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Mr. Flanagan, gentlemen.
Kay.
Hi, Kay.
Soon as you've had your ice cream and cookies, we'll go to the movies.
All right, guys, let's go.
This way, gentlemen.
That's right.
What have you got?
I hope I'm gonna see you guys in my office later.
ALL:
We'll see you later.
Mark.
Let's roll the dice on Clay Gardner before I change my mind.
You got it.
FRANK:
Pete, listen, we're gonna go with Gardner.
So, first thing tomorrow set up a negotiating session.
I'll call Herbie Stone.
You all right?
I'm fine.
No, I mean really.
I mean, I'm really fine, Mark.
Good.
He can handle it.
Well, this picture is very much a Kay Freestone effort, I understand.
Oh, yes.
You'll find little flecks of my blood on each and every frame.
Gentlemen, I'll be in the booth.
Enjoy yourselves.
ALL:
Thank you.
Frank, do you really think that William Morris will cave-in that much on the price?
A million at least.
You got to be kidding it's seven.
Nobody believes seven.
Evening, Walter.
Hi, Kay.
VIP time, huh?
Oh, it's murder.
You got all nine reels here?
Ninety minutes, nine reels.
Okay.
You watching back here again, huh?
Walter,
I wrestled this bloody film through that nutty studio for six months.
If you so much as make one mistake in a changeover,
I'll kill you.
Yowsah, Miss Freestone.
Your film is gonna go through this gate at the incredible rate of 90 feet per minute.
You just watch this little old counter here.
And no sooner will this first reel finish up when I will see two little flashes of light out there in the upper right hand corner of your lovely picture.
And then I will, with lightning speed, switch over to this projector right here.
And not only will your big-shots not know that I have switched a reel, they'll not suspect one little old thing.
Bravo.
Kay, roll when you're ready.
All right.
Okay.
What's this called?
The Professional.
Mmm.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
Good luck.
Thanks, I'll need it.
(MOOD Y JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
(EXHALING)
Frank, has Standards and Practices seen this yet?
(SHUSHING)
WALTER:
Changeover.
Flash.
Go.
Couldrt have done it better myself.
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)
Marius?
Not exactly the family hour, is it?
Walter, where are those other reels?
What other reels?
Screen tests that I ordered for Broad Land.
Flanagan might want to see them.
Oh, somebody goofed.
They must still be down in Shipping.
Well, you better go get them.
Four reels.
Well, there's a changeover coming in about two minutes.
I'll take care of the changeover.
You just get those reels for me, please.
KAY ON RECORDER:
You have four minutes.
You have three minutes and 50 seconds.
You have three minutes and 40 seconds.
You have three minutes and 30 seconds.
You have three minutes and 20 seconds.
You have three minutes and 10 seconds.

Make the changeover okay?
Like a champ.
All right.
Well, how's it going?
Well, no one's left yet.
(GUN FIRING)
How long are they gonna keep putting that stuff on television?
(ON SPEAKER) Kay, would you come in here a minute?
What?
I'll be right in.
KAY ON SPEAKER:
Walter, no more picture tonight.
(MUSIC STOPS)
Kay, I'm so terribly shocked.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, we're all very sorry.
I'm sure he'd be the first one to say there's no disrespect in our just doing our jobs.
What is there for today?
They asked for you in Mark's office.
Soon as you came in.
Kay, steady, love.
Good morning, madam.
Lieutenant Columbo, Homicide.
And you're Miss Freestone?
Yes, Lieutenant.
No disrespect intended, madam, but that's where Mr. McAndrews was lying, just like that.
When he was shot, that is.
Is there any way I can be of help, Lieutenant?
I don't believe so, madam.
Nice of you to offer.
We think it's a whiplash.
The doctors are making tests.
I'm so sorry.
No, I...
I meant, is there any way I can help you with your investigation?
Oh, the investigation.
Yes, madam, I think there is.
Now, I understand that you worked very closely with the victim.
Yes, I was his executive assistant.
Yes, madam.
And would you agree that these were his glasses?
They look like them, yes.
Then would you mind coming through that door, madam?
Excuse me?
If you would just go out and come through that door, please.
(DOOR CLOSING)
Come on in, madam.
COLUMBO:
Come on in.
Stop right there, madam.
Now, if you'll just hold out your arm.
Where?
Just point it at me, madam.
Like you were holding a pistol.
Thank you very much, madam.
My father wore glasses just like these.
And when I was a youngster, I used to like to put them on.
Made me feel like a grown-up.
There's something I wanted to ask you about Mr. McAndrews, madam.
An item that I found here on his desk a little piece of paper.
Well, it will turn up.
My mother used to grab the glasses off me.
"They're bad for your eyes," she used to say.
You know, in those days, everything was bad for your eyes.
Not wearing mittens was bad for your eyes.
Wearing rubbers in the house, that'd strike you blind on the spot.
I don't know what I did with that damn paper.
Well, it will turn up.
That must be very uncomfortable.
madam?
Oh, this?
Well, it's better than a gallstone.
Did you ever have a gallstone, madam?
Whew!
No, I don't think so.
If there's nothing else, Lieutenant...
I've got 12 men searching, Lieutenant.
Is that enough?
As many as you can get, Sergeant.
We haven't found the weapon, madam.
We think it still might be on the premises.
I know there was a paper on this desk.
Oh, Sergeant Burke, this is Miss Freestone.
She was Mr. McAndrews' executive assistant.
Found you.
I think you're wanted in your office.
Something about Mr. Flanagan.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant, I think there's something you should see.
Would you mind coming with me?
Certainly, madam.
Keep searching, Sergeant.
BURKE:
Yes, sir.
We lost a hell of a lot more than manpower.
No, they don't know anything yet.
(KNOCKING)
Yes, I'll be staying around until we can get the pieces back together.
Kay, I hope I didn't take you away.
You all right?
Your men have everything they need, Lieutenant?
Well, it's very confusing, sir.
I mean, there were only so many people in the building last night.
You and your people, Miss Freestone and the projectionist and the young man working next door.
Every single one of them is accounted for.
With your terrific security and all, no one else could get in or out of the building.
So the question is, who killed Mr. McAndrews?
That's why I want you to look at these, Lieutenant.
You personally won this award yourself, madam?
Indeed she did, Lieutenant.
"For Best Documentary Production."
Well, you certainly are a very clever woman, madam.
That's why she's with us.
Very clever indeed.
Let's just say I work like an ox.
Please sit right here, Lieutenant.
Thank you, madam.
FRANK:
Kay.
Under the circumstances, I'm gonna ask something of you.
We'd like you to help us by taking over all of Mark's duties, at least for the time being.
Of course.
Anything I can do to help, Mr. Flanagan.
Good.
I knew I could count on you.
You can start by locking up Clay Gardner in The Broad Land.
Oh, Mr. Flanagan, I wanted to talk to you about The Professional, the film last night?
I think we should talk about that some other time.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I'm sure it'll be off in a few days.
I call it weird, madam.
All these crazy crank letters.
Have you ever told the police about these threats?
Yes, I certainly have.
You'll notice that the network gets blamed for everything that's going, be it communism, fascism, atheism, abortion, sex, violence.
You name it.
Up, down or in the middle.
It's all the same thing.
"Support decency or we'll kill you."
Signed in blood.
So, naturally, when this happened, it occurred to me...
That one of these nuts slipped in here and killed Mr. McAndrews?
Well, other attempts have been made, twice on Mr. Flanagan.
I don't think so, madam.
Not in this case.
Granted, there's a lot of nuts running around, some of them dangerous.
Not in this case.
You seem very sure, Lieutenant.
That's because Mr. McAndrews recognized his murderer.
He knew the person who shot him.
I find that very hard to believe.
I don't wanna distress you, madam, but there's no doubt about it.
I know I had that paper somewhere.
Why is there no doubt about it?
We know the angle of the bullet, madam.
We know that the murderer didn't shoot from the door.
He entered the office.
I'd say he was 18 feet in by the time he pulled the trigger.
Well, why couldn't a stranger be 18 feet into a room?
Well, let me put it to you this way, madam.
If you were alone in a room at night, lying on a couch, and a stranger entered, wouldn't you take a good look at him?
Wouldrt you wanna see what he looked like?
Yes.
That's the point, madam.
Mr. McAndrews didn't bother to take a really good look.
It's these glasses, madam.
He had them up here on his forehead when he was shot.
When the murderer came into the room.
So Mr. McAndrews must've known exactly who that person was, or he would've pushed them down, like this.
Because with these type corrections, madam, these bifocals, this is the only way that Mr. McAndrews could see his killer.
If the killer was a stranger, that is.
Which he couldn't have been.
But I'll keep your theory in mind.
Interesting, isn't it, how you can work these small things out if you just think about it?
Like you got a tiny voice whispering right in your ear, trying to tell you who did it.
You're a very attentive listener, Lieutenant.
Oh, yes, madam.
Why that's all we got to go on.
Listen and look, look and listen.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
WALTER:
You see, you watch your counter for the blip and then you stand by for the blip.
You mean to tell me that all these years, every time I took Mrs. Columbo to the theater, those flashes were on the screen?
They have been on the screen even before Mrs. Columbo, Lieutenant.
The upper right hand corner.
In a regular theater?
A regular theater.
If I go to the movies tonight, 8:30, down the block, a dollar and a half, and I walk in and sit down and watch the movie, you mean to tell me that I will see those flashes on the screen?
Right.
That goes to show you, you learn something new every day.
Now, the flashes tell the projectionist when he's supposed to change his reel.
All right, all right, watch.
Flash.
Now, you tell me when you see the second one.
Flash.
Mr. Mearhead,
I would say you did that like an artist.
Listen, you wanna see art, Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, this is art.
Isn't that remarkable?
You did that yourself?
That I did, sir.
When I was a kid, I used to build model airplanes.
I'd start them but I could never finish them.
I'd always wreck them.
Miss Freestone, she made the changeover last night when you went out for The Broad Land screen tests?
Yeah, about two minutes after I left.
I checked that counter.
You checked the counter,
Miss Freestone, she changed the projector.
Did Miss Freestone make the splice, too?
What splice?
You mean the film didn't break?
Isn't this one of those editor's gloves?
Right.
I mean, she could've fixed the film if anything happened, but nothing happened to the film.
You see,
I use these gloves because of the glue.
Well, thank you very much, sir.
Do you think it would be asking too much if I took one of these things for my nephew?
Sure, help yourself.
The kid's 15-years-old and he sold all his stereo stuff to make eight-millimeter movies.
When I was a kid in my neighborhood, we had heroes.
DiMaggio, Rizzuto...
You know who he's got on the wall?
Francis Ford Coppola.
(EXCLAIMING)
Sorry, madam.
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Oh, Walter, you can send those test reels back to Shipping anytime.
Oh, those tests, madam, the tests, they've already gone back to Shipping.
I spoke to the gentleman in charge.
Oh.
Fine, then.
COLUMBO: madam. madam.
About those tests that you sent out for last night.
Those were tests for a new series called The Broad Land?
Yes, Lieutenant, they were talent tests.
Yes, well there's something that I don't understand, madam, and maybe I should...
I probably should...
Lord knows I'm not the brightest guy on the force.
Another detective, he could cut right through all this.
I understand, Lieutenant.
Just ask your questions.
That's the problem, madam.
When I ask the questions, I know I'm putting you on the spot.
It's perfectly all right, Lieutenant.
It's your job.
I appreciate that.
Thank you very much, madam.
If only more people felt that way.
The question is...
Mr. Flanagan says that he already approved Clay Gardner to star in that new series.
So I had to ask myself, if he already approved him, why would you wanna show him more tests?
You see my problem, madam?
Yes, I do, and I wondered exactly the same thing myself.
Did you?
Mmm-hmm.
This time I think you're listening to the wrong little voice in your ear, Lieutenant.
I was just following instructions.
Mr. Flanagars instructions?
Mr. McAndrews' instructions.
Written instructions, madam?
Verbal instructions, Lieutenant.
I see.
Well, we certainly can't ask Mr. McAndrews, can we?
(ELEVATOR DINGING)
I'm afraid I do have to go, Lieutenant.
COLUMBO:
Oh, madam.
Excuse me, madam.
I know you're pressed.
I don't wanna hold you up.
Can we walk and talk?
Let's.
I know that Mr. McAndrews was an important executive, and I know that CNC is a big television network.
But I have no idea what he did all day and night, from what I can see around here.
Well, I can hardly speak for his nights, Lieutenant.
I didn't mean to imply, madam.
His days were mostly like mine.
We run a fire department around here.
Do you want to look at some of the flames?
Flames, madam?
Yes, mostly we put out fires.
LUTHER:
Nancy, monitor two.
NANC Y:
One, please.
LUTHER:
Thank you, sweetheart.
Yeah, now, that's the angle I want for the third position.
MAN:
Looking nice kids.
Looking very good.
Start from the top and I'll watch it up here.
Oh, Kay, we've already lost two hours.
Where is she?
Luther will tell you.
Oh, Lieutenant, I'll be busy for a minute.
Just help yourself.
Don't worry about me, madam.
(SHUSHING)
Luther?
LUTHER:
Coming down.
You can take a break now, Nancy.
Thanks.
NANCY:
All right, everybody, five minutes, please.
Where are we?
Replace her, Kay.
Valerie?
She's never gonna make it.
Not a live show.
Not in this world.
Oh, come on, we're on tomorrow night.
She's terrified, she's hysterical.
She's losing her mind.
I mean, she doesn't even understand that this is not an MGM sound stage 20 years ago.
She hates the blocking, she hates the camera, she hates me.
You, I don't know about.
Look, a few times a day she'll have a nice rush of confidence for 10 minutes and then she'll remember it's a live show, bite one of the dancers on the leg and run to her dressing room and hide.
Aside from all that, her work is lousy.
Where is she?
Dressing room.
Luther, is she on anything?
Oh, please.
COLUMBO:
You mean it's gonna be live TV, just the way it used to be?
TECHNICAL DIRECTOR:
A little bit better, Lieutenant, we hope.
This is where the director will sit.
Here, sit down.
This is a technical director's console.
Does that bother you?
(STAMMERING) That's just whiplash.
I mean, I think it's a whiplash.
My doctor thinks it's a whiplash.
The chiropractor, he thinks I just got a bad massage.
And my wife's osteopath, he thinks it might be a back problem.
It doesn't look like a back problem.
That's what the orthopedic man said.
Listen, all these screens for just one show?
That's a line monitor.
That's what's going on the air.
Preview monitor is what the director wants up next and those are what the four cameras see.
I do the switching.
Hey, all these beautiful machines in here, all these buttons to push.
I know it costs millions and I know that everybody works very hard.
But I gotta tell you the truth.
To me, it looks like fun.
It is, but I wouldn't swear to it in court.
And Miss Freestone, she understands all about this, too?
I'll tell you about that.
If there's one thing worse than a television lady who thinks she knows everything, it's a television lady who knows everything.
I'll see you later, Lieutenant.

KAY:
Val, it's Kay.
Whose side are you on?
Whose do you think?
Prove it.
You can keep the key to my apartment.
Oh, Kay.
Give me a hug.
Oh, I thought you'd never get here.
Did Luther get over his snit yet?
How about yours?
Big deal.
I tried to tell that genius where to put my key light and the roof fell in.
Big man from New York.
Luther's very good.
He's the best in the business for live shows.
He'll make you look like a million.
A million years old.
Is that how you feel?
Want your key back?
Val, are you clean?
Oh, my God.
I look like a junky, huh?
I've had no booze, no pills, no sniff and no smoke.
Except these damn things, that's all.
(SOBBING)
Can you look at me, babe?
How scared are you?
I'm terrified.
I can't do it, Kay.
I just don't know how to do it anymore.
I don't know what you have to do.
Sing, dance, be funny in front of 40 million people.
I'd do it myself if I had the time.
Come on.
LUTHER:
And then we'll go to four after the crane shot.
Luther.
Mmm?
Take a look at this.
What's that?
LUTHER:
Oh, boy.
Eddie, give me a tight two-shot on Kay and Valerie, would you?
Valerie Kirk.
Valerie Kirk?
Wait till I tell my wife.
Hey, boss, you want a willing worker?
Well, what are we waiting for?
And the lighting is terrific.
I don't believe it.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go to work.
Anything else, maestro?
Yeah.
How about walking on water?
Oh, yeah.
LUTHER:
Valerie, I'm coming right down.
Wait for me.
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)
(CRASHING) madam?
Lieutenant, you frightened me.
Oh, I'm sorry, madam.
Your secretary said you were coming here.
I'll just take that.
Are you supposed to take that off?
Well, I thought I'd cheat for a while.
An hour won't hurt.
What do you think?
I think you're very attractive without it, but that's not a medical opinion.
Well, I'll tell you, madam, it's the nicest opinion I've heard yet.
She said, your secretary, that you used to live here.
Yes.
My mother raised three of us in this place.
I guess nothing sends you scurrying back to your roots like somebody else's death, does it?
Oh, I thought, madam, now that you have this new, important job you might have paid a visit just to see how far you've come.
Excuse me.
I'll just get another chair.
May I, madam?
Let's dine by candlelight, Lieutenant.
That'd be very nice, madam.
You know, I always knew this place was small but I never realized it was quite this tiny.
Four of us cramped in here.
Never a chance to be alone.
I took a trip a few years ago.
Took Mrs. Columbo back to the house where I grew up.
It looked all shrunken.
I had five brothers and one sister, Miss Freestone, and that was really terrific.
There was always someone around for company.
We were never lonely.
You're a very special man, Lieutenant.
You accept things as they are.
I try to change them.
That's to your credit, madam.
Your success and ambition and all.
Now, I'm supposed to ask you questions about all that.
You're supposed to?
Well, nobody told me to, but that's the way I'm supposed to do my job.
They're certainly not personal.
Whenever anyone says it's not personal, that's exactly when it's very personal.
It's not by choice, madam.
Sometimes I get all tense when I have to do it.
Well, then that's your problem, Lieutenant.
We have to do something to relieve some of that tension.
Oh.
Be careful, madam.
I won't touch your neck.
Just relax.
(GROANING)
That's a real relief.
What I wanted to ask you, madam, would you have gotten this new job, in charge of West Coast production, if Mr. McAndrews hadrt been murdered?
Go on, madam.
You're not hurting me.
No.
I don't think Mark would have given me the job.
May I ask, madam, why you say that?
He never mentioned it.
Now the fact is, he never mentioned it to any of his executive staff.
But you were his main assistant.
Perhaps Mr. Flanagan had objections.
Well, I don't mean to pin you down, madam, but it was Mr. Flanagan who gave you your promotion.
Yes.
But it's not a permanent promotion, Lieutenant.
Remember that.
Well, Mr. Flanagan told me that it would have been okay with him if the murdered man had given you the job.
Then it was Mark's decision.
I hear those little voices going around in your ear, Lieutenant, asking could I possibly have miraculously murdered Mark for his job?
Oh, no, madam.
I don't think that at all.
You were up in the projection booth.
And I don't think people kill people for just a job.
Even an important job like yours.
A little lower down, madam, if you don't mind.
Either there was no motive at all, like in these crazy kind of murders that you read about in the newspaper, or there was a very good motive.
One that makes terrific sense.
And that's what keeps going around in my mind.
The motive.
No, I couldn't think those thoughts about you, Miss Freestone.
Not as long as all you had with Mr. McAndrews was a business relationship.
Well, I'm sure you've checked that out with the executive staff, haven't you, Lieutenant?
Not by choice, madam.
I wish I could help you, Lieutenant.
You have, Miss Freestone.
I'm gonna try sleeping tonight without this thing.
Well then, if you'll forgive me.
I've had enough of my olden times.
Yes, madam.
How do you like that?
I almost forgot again.
That item that I found on the victim's desk.
The one that I lost.
Well, I found it again.
It was a slip of paper.
Like a note that he was making to himself.
Some numbers and the capital letter "K."
Take a look at this, madam.
Maybe you can help me.
COLUMBO:
You see the capital letter "K"
and the numbers 280, 450 with a circle around it,
240 and 230.
Now, the "K" with those numbers.
Does that mean anything to you, madam?
Not a thing.
No.
You see, the numbers part,
I think that they form some kind of a pattern.
I think they got something in common and it's right on the tip of my tongue but I can't put my finger on it.
You can't help me?
Sorry.
Well, thanks a lot anyway.
What's your first name, madam?
Katherine.
But they call you Kay.
Yes.
And there's this capital letter "K" on the note.
Yes.
Does that ring a bell, madam?
No.
Nothing at all?
No, no help at all.
In this case, the "K" must simply be a "K."
Can't blame me for trying, madam.
COLUMBO:
You see, Mrs. Columbo, she never believed the doctor right from the start.
She claimed I was sleeping in a draft.
Well, last night she insisted upon closing the windows.
Well, I woke up this morning, I tell you, Sergeant, my neck felt terrific.
That's very good, Lieutenant.
I was getting so desperate that I was gonna go to this clinic where my brother-in-law goes for his back problem.
What they did, they said they had to deaden the nerves in his nose.
His nose, Lieutenant?
His nose.
They stuck a needle in his nose.
Sticking right out of his nose, like this.
That's how he had to walk around, with a needle in his nose.
What do you think of that, Sergeant?
That's very interesting, Lieutenant.
I think so, too.
Don't let me hold you up, Sergeant.
You go ahead.
Yes, sir.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
Mr. Mearhead?
Oh, hi, Lieutenant.
Come on in.
I just wanted to say that I dropped the glove off for my nephew.
He figures it'll improve his editing 100%.
Well, you tell him he ought to become a surgeon.
That way he won't have to see so much blood.
You got any opinions about violence on television?
Well, I work nights a lot.
I wanna tell you something.
The other night, I come back from Film Shipping and the first thing I see is some guy blowing his brains out.
I mean, you think that's right?
I got a change coming up.
You know, it's crazy, Mr. Mearhead, but since I've been hanging around here I think I've become a button freak.
Buttons and switches.
Mmm-hmm.
You don't suppose I could try to make one of these changeovers myself?
I don't see why not.
All it is, is a writer watching an old movie.
All right, when you see your first flash, buttons up.
Button up.
Round before your dowser.
Dowser up.
On your second flash, Lieutenant, button here, button there, press.
Button, button.
Dowser down.
Down on dowser.
Left light off.
So, on the first flash, buttons up?
Buttons up.
And the dowser up.
WALTER:
Flash coming up.
COLUMBO:
First flash.
Flash up.
Second flash coming up.
Second flash.
Now the buttons go on the flash or before?
Did I miss?
It goes on the flash, Lieutenant.
On the flash.
There it is.
On the flash.
Okay.
What happened?

I heard your promises last night and the night before.
Now, out of the carousel location by midnight tonight.
Kay, Luther's on one.
You have to talk to him.
What it is is a 90-minute melodrama.
Now, you get that on tape tonight, by midnight, or I am personally coming out there to pull the plug.
It's about Valerie.
Yes, Luther.
Valerie is gone.
What do you mean, she's gone?
I mean she's gone.
Gone is gone.
Up the chimney.
Nobody's seen her since we finished the dress rehearsal on the USO number.
And we go on the air in three hours and 20 minutes.
(GRUNTING)
Well, did she leave the building?
Has anyone checked with the guards?
Kay, she left the building.
She's at your place.

I'll get right back to you, Luther.
Valerie?
She's gone.
I'll get her back.
I'll get her back.
Valerie.
Val!
Valerie!
Did you call, madam?
You call me, "Madam," but never call me, "Late for dinner."
(VALERIE LAUGHING)
Come on.
Don't you touch me.
I don't want to!
I have to do the show.
I'm gonna do the show.
Luther's scared.
Luther's so scared.
Valerie's gonna do it live!
(VALERIE GROANING)
Kay, please.
Sure.
Please.
I hurt myself.
Me, too, kiddo.
Me, too.
I told you I couldn't do it!
Nobody listens.
They'll listen when I sing.
They'll listen when I sing.
They'll listen when I sing.
(VALERIE MOANING)
Please, give me a hug.
No more hugs.
We're fresh out of hugs.
I tried.
I'm just not good anymore.
Anymore.
Mr. Ames, please.
Henry, Valerie Kirk's at my apartment.
She won't be able to make the show tonight.
It doesn't matter right now.
Look, just get control of yourself.
We'll put in something else.
We'll put in a picture.
What else have we got?
Run The Professional.
It's the right length.
I got it made, didn't I?
Just tell the press that she fell down some stairs and hurt her leg.
What did you do?
What all good girls do.
The best I can.
Come on.
Give us a hug.
I really did it to you, didn't I, Kay?
I mean, I really did it.
It doesn't matter.
It's only a show.
I've got a million of them, kiddo.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Closed.
You promised.
What?
You promised.
Closed.
What?
Promised what?
My television set.
Lieutenant Columbo.
You brought it in this morning.
(BELL DINGING)
Yeah, I wanted it for tonight but I had to work late.
I'm working late myself on your television set.
Well, you see, sir, working nights, I don't get to see much television.
Mrs. Columbo, she does a lot of reading and she takes a lot of night school courses.
So the real TV fan in the house, that's my dog.
(MOOD Y JAZZ PLAYING ON T. V.)
Boy, you got it going.
That's terrific.
He likes television.
He can't get enough of it.
You see that.
You like that?
He like it?
Yes, sir, I think he likes it.
How do you know he likes it?
He never saw nothing yet he didn't like.
Well, if he didn't like it, how would you know he didn't like it?
Well, he would look very bored, sir.
All droopy and listless.
I'll tell you the reason that we wanted to see TV tonight is, we wanted to see the second half of The Valerie Kirk Show.
Not on.
Not on?
I said it's not on.
This is the channel.
They got something else on instead.
Something called The Professional.
Oh, The Professional.
Would you believe I know the lady that made that show?
Not a bad picture.
Spy stuff.
Spies.
Your favorite.
You gonna start that again?
Come on, we gotta...
Up where the view is here.
All right, move over.
That's it.
There, are you comfortable?
Come on, up here where you can see.
Is that all right?
(GUN FIRING ON T. V.)
Sorry, Lieutenant.
Still not right.
Not bad, sir.
Not bad at all.
You just keep working.
I could fix you up with a terrific new one.
Under $400.
Your dog would love it.
No.
I gotta buy a new bumper for my car, maybe a new pair of shoes.
I think I'll pass.
Okay with you?
It's okay with him.
If it's okay with him, it's okay with me.
Good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, sir.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.

(COLUMBO STRIKING A MATCH)
Lieutenant.
You're working rather late tonight, aren't you?
Yes, madam.
Working late like a television executive.
That's a very impressive desk, madam.
You could run the world from a desk like that.
The world doesn't count.
Just the West Coast.
Through for the day, madam?
No.
Not quite.
Mr. McAndrews,
he wasrt married?
He wasrt married.
Was he ever married, madam?
I don't know.
Engaged?
Engaged?
Engaged, madam.
I don't know.
What about women?
Did he run around a lot?
MADGE:
Kay.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'll be moving in here tomorrow.
Would you please call the beach location and let them know that I'm coming out there tonight?
And then that would be all.
Okay.
Good night.
I was asking, madam, if he ran around with a lot of women.
I don't know.
He must've had companions.
Would you say that women found Mr. McAndrews attractive?
I'm sure his secretaries did.
You, personally, did you find him attractive?
Yes,
Mark was a very attractive man, in his way.
You're an attractive man, in your way, too.
I guess I told you that.
Yes, madam.
Please sit down.
Now, I ask people questions and they answer.
Now, I ask them the same question another time and they answer in a different way.
That's not because they're lying, madam.
I know that and I appreciate that.
There's been a death.
People are in shock, confusion.
People misremember.
They misspeak themselves.
Have I said something wrong?
Well, let's go all over again.
You said you knew nothing about how Mr. McAndrews spent his nights.
That had nothing to do with you?
Mmm-hmm.
Sometimes we dined together if we worked late.
And dates, girls.
Maybe somebody he lived with.
We never asked each other.
Well, that holds with what you said before.
But I'm surprised, madam.
And I don't mind telling you, I find it all very troubling.
Because I was at Mr. McAndrews' house yesterday.
The beach house.
And some cleaning was delivered, some slacks and this blazer.
And that's the problem, madam.
This blazer.
You see, I noticed that the buttons are on the wrong side.
It buttons right over left, the wrong side for a mars jacket that is, because this is a womars blazer.
There's a tailor's label in it.
And I checked on that.
This jacket was made for you.
It's your jacket.
Would you like to try it on, madam?
No.
Well, since you were sending your cleaning out from Mr. McAndrews' house,
I can only assume...
All right, Lieutenant.
You've done very good work.
You've caught me in a lie.
I would say so, madam, yes.
Well, the corporation being what it is,
Mark and I didn't feel it would be very discrete to advertise our relationship.
Now, you can understand that, can't you?
Yes, madam, I can understand that.
But being discrete with the police, that's something else again.
Is it so really important to the police?
Well, you might have been able to tell us things.
Now, we're gonna have to talk about that.
All right.
I'm due on location now, so perhaps we can talk about it later on tomorrow.
As you say, you're not racing the clock and I am.
I guess another day won't make that much difference.
And I promise not to change my address or renew my passport or leave town
or ever tell another lie.
Well, you werert even under oath, madam.
But what we have here, it's a matter of civic responsibility.
All the way down, madam?
All the way down.
I mean, if everybody kept their little secrets from the police, we'd be forever getting to the bottom of our cases.
My goodness.
I'm not supposed to do this in the elevator.
Excuse me?
I was talking about cooperation, madam.
I had a case once.
A man was cheating on his wife and he was a very important witness, but he was afraid to tell me.
I understand.
I hope you do, madam.
I apologize, Lieutenant.
I hope you forgive me.
Well, it's not my place, madam.
Oh, just so we have a meeting of minds.
Oh, about that note, the one that was on Mr. McAndrews' desk.
The one with all the numbers on it, the 450, the 280, the 230, the 250.
Nothing to worry about, madam.
It came to me.
Those were just some automobile models, different kinds of Mercedes cars.
So I guess, Mr. McAndrews, he must have been in the market for a new car.
Arert you coming, madam?
No, there's a phone call I forgot to make.
Good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, madam.

Now, at least you're back on schedule for tonight.
Where's the AD?
Kay, got a minute for me?
Mr. Flanagan.
Of course.
All right if we sit in the car?
If you like.
Oh, Carl.
Does this bother you?
No, not at all.
I want to talk about some of the difficulties you've been having.
Valerie Kirk.
I understand she's a close personal friend.
Yes, that's true.
I also understand that her director tried to warn you about her incompetence.
That's also true.
Well, we'll put that aside.
The decision to use The Professional as a replacement for Valerie's show,
I'm sure you know the ratings were very poor.
Well, under the circumstances...
Well, you created the circumstances.
Now, Kay, nobody knows better than you that The Professional cost us $1,600,000, including a second run.
Now, you wasted the first one.
You threw away an impressive film.
I was under the impression that you didn't like that film at all.
You had no right to make an assumption about what I like.
We'll...
We'll put that aside, too.
I've also been told that you're...
You're planning to...
To move into Mark's office tomorrow.
Why not?
I'll be needing more space.
The office comes with the job.
But you don't, Kay.
Nobody ever told you that your present duties were permanent.
Also, I question your taste in leaping so quickly behind a dead mars desk.
Well, I seem to have made quite a big hit.
All in all.
Now, you don't have to rush looking for a new position.
We'll, let's say, make it official at the end of the month?
I'll try to consult you in the press release.
Do you expect hysterics?
I hope not.
I'm as tough as you are.
I'll survive.
And you'll want me back.
I hope so.

Miss Freestone, madam, are you here?
Miss Freestone.
We're very busy where I am, Lieutenant.
You're going to have to forgive me.
We have problems.
Too many problems to speak now.
KAY ON SPEAKER:
So I'm sorry, you'll have to forgive me.
I can't speak right now, Lieutenant.
Oh, I get it.
The cameras.
Oh, you're up in that control place.
You can see me on those big screens?
I'm right.
You can see me.
Right, madam?
Lieutenant, can we speak tomorrow at the office?
No, I...
I'll call you.
I definitely promise I'll do that, Lieutenant.
I'll call you.
Well, it's very important that we talk tonight, madam.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm afraid I'll have to insist, madam.
I really have to do that.
I can't accept that.
I can't speak now!
Please bear with me, madam.
It has to do with the car.
The 450SL, the silver one that's registered in your name.
The one that Mr. McAndrews bought.
That's all very puzzling, madam.
And there are other things.
There's your picture, The Professional, and this connection with whoever murdered Mr. McAndrews.
And there is a connection.
I'm pretty sure of that, madam.
I'm afraid it's necessary.
I know you're under a lot of pressure, madam, but there are these things that we should talk about tonight.
I don't like to have to talk to you this way, madam.
I know how you feel.
But it's very hard not being able to see you.
(KAY SCREAMING)
madam?
I told you I have work to do, Lieutenant.
This show needs a lot of work.
The script needs work.
madam,
like I asked you before, this new job you got, would you have it if Mr. McAndrews hadrt been murdered?
No.
I already told you, I don't think so.
I don't think so either.
Is that why he bought you the car?
Sort of a parting gift considering your relationship, like he was getting rid of you?
I find that very intrusive, Lieutenant.
And I don't think you have a right.
Oh, I have the right, madam.
But I understand your feelings.
Please, keep bearing with me, madam.
Sit down.
You know, maybe it was fate.
But I came within 30 seconds of not seeing your TV movie The Professional.
But I did see it, madam.
And I noticed something very peculiar.
So peculiar that I had the projectionist run it again today.
And that Technical Director that I met, he made this up for me on television tape.
It's your movie, madam.
The part where the fella's in the hotel room and he's gonna shoot himself.
Now, the Technical Director told me that there would be an eject button, blue.
Yes.
And a slot right here.
And an RT button one.
Here.
There it is madam.
(MOOD Y JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
Now, we'll just watch this together, madam.
There it is now, there.
There he is.
He's by the sink.
And there he's washing.
There, right there, you see the flash?
Yes, Lieutenant, it's a cue blip.
And now the second one.
There.
There's the second cue.
Now that's the cue for the projectionist to make his changeover.
Am I right, Miss Freestone?
Yes, Lieutenant, I'm very impressed.
Excuse me, madam.
I don't mean to interrupt.
Right there, that high shot where the mars lying on the hotel bed.
That's where the new reel begins.
Just watch it, madam.
(GUN FIRING ON T. V.)
And there, that's where the man commits suicide.
And that's what the projectionist saw right after he got back from the shipping room.
That's what Mr. Mearhead told me.
He came back into the booth, looked up and he saw a man blowing his brains out.
You had to make the changeover right before Mr. Mearhead got back from the shipping room.
Not a few minutes earlier, not sometime before,
like he thought.
I'm afraid, in this case,
Walter must be confused, Lieutenant.
He checked the footage counter before he left.
You must've fooled him about that, madam.
What I think,
I think you changed the footage counter to place yourself in the projection booth at the time of the murder.
But really, madam, you had time enough to leave the booth and get to Mr. McAndrews' office.
Just enough time.
Because when you rushed back to make the changeover, that's when you must've dropped this glove
by the projector.
It's Walter's glove.
Walter's projection booth.
I don't think you have a case against Walter.
No, madam.
Not the way he kept that booth, so immaculate and all.
I don't see him just throwing a glove on the floor.
And the lab says that this glove has powder burns on it.
And then there's the gun.
Mr. McAndrews' gun, the gun that murdered him.
The one that you put on the elevator.
Our people found it this afternoon.
And then we took a second gun, one that looked like this gun and we put it back on the elevator.
But we put it where it could be seen as if the continuous movement of the elevator had jiggled it so now it became visible.
Watch this, madam.
That's a TV picture of where we placed the second gun, just before you got on the elevator with me, madam.
There it is.
Now, there...
That's the way it looked right after you got back on the elevator and came off it.
And you'll notice, there is no gun.
Not anymore.
Because you got rid of it.
But this gun...
This is the gun that you murdered him with.
I see.
I'm sure you do, madam.
It's very odd.
They say there's a great sense of relief that comes when something like this is over.
I don't feel that at all.
Quite the opposite.
Will you be taking me?
Yes, madam, into town.
After that...
After that, I think I know what will happen.
I'll fight.
I'll survive.
I might even win.
Yes, madam.
Should we turn this off, madam?
It doesn't matter.
Yes, madam, the power shortage.
I think I know the right button.

Here I am worrying about myself
Poor, precious Mark suffering through the awful truth
Farewell, my dearest, the time has come
Great secret lovers
Super corporate team
But onward and upward
Whoopdeedoo
Kay in the end all we really owe each other is a little bit of affection
Nobody was keeping tabs, were they?
So much for overtime, so much for double time, so much for playtime
MARK:
Kay
You wanna sue me?
Shoot me?
That make you feel better?
Right through the heart Make me a perfect murder, babe
Kay
You were supposed to find these out there
A 450SL
The silver one
It's the one you always wanted
It's still at the dealer showroom But it's registered in your name
You can drive it home
The license plate says, "Kay #1 "
Well, that's a comment from the management
Goodbye, Kay?
Sit up, Lieutenant
I want you to relax
Tilt your head back
WhatWhat are you gonna do?
Just give your neck a little adjustment
What do you mean by adjustment?
Don't worry, Lieutenant, it won't hurt at all
I'll tell you, Sam, I don't think it hurts anymore
It won't hurt at all
Sam, it already doesn't hurt at all
Relax Relax

Sorry, Jonathan
I'm going to need all those Clay Gardner demographs first thing in the morning
Kay, that's gonna take all night
Well, unless you'd like to explain your troubles to Mr Flanagan, you'd better plan on spending the night
Condolences, Junior Comes with the territory
FRANK:
Well, who says Clay Gardner's ready to do TV?
PETE:
Just once I'd like to sit down to a hot meal
MARK:
At $7 million a season, let's just say he might be tempted
His agent take the hook yet?
No, I'm still setting it
Planes don't count That's toy food It's really up to Frank
What do you think, Pete?
Before, I got to be a VP Now I put it between bread
We'll still come out of it
Do you really want to lay out that kind of cash, Frank?
If we start paying $7 million, every actor we have will wanna renegotiate
Clay Gardner isn't every actor
Thank God
(ALL LAUGHING)
Mr Flanagan, gentlemen
Kay Hi, Kay
Soon as you've had your ice cream and cookies, we'll go to the movies
All right, guys, let's go This way, gentlemen
That's right What have you got?
I hope I'm gonna see you guys in my office later
ALL:
We'll see you later
Mark
Let's roll the dice on Clay Gardner before I change my mind
You got it
FRANK:
Pete, listen, we're gonna go with Gardner
So, first thing tomorrow set up a negotiating session I'll call Herbie Stone
You all right?
I'm fine
No, I mean really
I mean, I'm really fine, Mark
Good
He can handle it
Well, this picture is very much a Kay Freestone effort, I understand
Oh, yes You'll find little flecks of my blood on each and every frame
Gentlemen, I'll be in the booth Enjoy yourselves
ALL:
Thank you
Frank, do you really think that William Morris will cavein that much on the price?
A million at least You got to be kidding it's seven Nobody believes seven
Evening, Walter
Hi, Kay
VIP time, huh?
Oh, it's murder
You got all nine reels here?
Ninety minutes, nine reels
Okay
You watching back here again, huh?
Walter,
I wrestled this bloody film through that nutty studio for six months
If you so much as make one mistake in a changeover,
I'll kill you
Yowsah, Miss Freestone
Your film is gonna go through this gate at the incredible rate of 90 feet per minute
You just watch this little old counter here
And no sooner will this first reel finish up when I will see two little flashes of light out there in the upper right hand corner of your lovely picture
And then I will, with lightning speed, switch over to this projector right here
And not only will your bigshots not know that I have switched a reel, they'll not suspect one little old thing
Bravo
Kay, roll when you're ready
All right Okay
What's this called?
The Professional Mmm
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)

Screen tests that I ordered for Broad Land Flanagan might want to see them
Oh, somebody goofed They must still be down in Shipping
Well, you better go get them Four reels
Well, there's a changeover coming in about two minutes
I'll take care of the changeover You just get those reels for me, please

(ON SPEAKER) Kay, would you come in here a minute?
What?
I'll be right in
KAY ON SPEAKER Walter, no more picture tonight
(MUSIC STOPS)
Kay, I'm so terribly shocked I'm so sorry
Yeah, we're all very sorry
I'm sure he'd be the first one to say there's no disrespect in our just doing our jobs
What is there for today?
They asked for you in Mark's office
Soon as you came in
Kay, steady, love
Good morning, ma'am
Lieutenant Columbo, Homicide
And you're Miss Freestone?
Yes, Lieutenant
No disrespect intended, ma'am, but that's where Mr McAndrews was lying, just like that
When he was shot, that is
Is there any way I can be of help, Lieutenant?
I don't believe so, ma'am Nice of you to offer
We think it's a whiplash The doctors are making tests
I'm so sorry
No, II meant, is there any way I can help you with your investigation?
Oh, the investigation Yes, ma'am, I think there is
Now, I understand that you worked very closely with the victim
Yes, I was his executive assistant
Yes, ma'am
And would you agree that these were his glasses?
They look like them, yes
Then would you mind coming through that door, ma'am?
Excuse me?
If you would just go out and come through that door, please
(DOOR CLOSING)
Come on in, ma'am
COLUMBO:
Come on in
Stop right there, ma'am
Now, if you'll just hold out your arm
Where?
Just point it at me, ma'am
Like you were holding a pistol
Thank you very much, ma'am
My father wore glasses just like these
And when I was a youngster, I used to like to put them on
Made me feel like a grownup
There's something I wanted to ask you about Mr McAndrews, ma'am
An item that I found here on his desk a little piece of paper
Well, it will turn up
My mother used to grab the glasses off me
"They're bad for your eyes," she used to say
You know, in those days, everything was bad for your eyes
Not wearing mittens was bad for your eyes
Wearing rubbers in the house, that'd strike you blind on the spot
I don't know what I did with that damn paper
Well, it will turn up
That must be very uncomfortable
Ma'am?
Oh, this?
Well, it's better than a gallstone
Did you ever have a gallstone, ma'am?
Whew!
No, I don't think so
If there's nothing else, Lieutenant
I've got 12 men searching, Lieutenant Is that enough?
As many as you can get, Sergeant
We haven't found the weapon, ma'am
We think it still might be on the premises
I know there was a paper on this desk
Oh, Sergeant Burke, this is Miss Freestone
She was Mr McAndrews' executive assistant
Found you
I think you're wanted in your office Something about Mr Flanagan
Oh, thank you
Lieutenant, I think there's something you should see
Would you mind coming with me?
Certainly, ma'am
Keep searching, Sergeant
BURKE:
Yes, sir
We lost a hell of a lot more than manpower
No, they don't know anything yet
(KNOCKING)
Yes, I'll be staying around until we can get the pieces back together
Kay, I hope I didn't take you away
You all right?
Your men have everything they need, Lieutenant?
Well, it's very confusing, sir
I mean, there were only so many people in the building last night
You and your people, Miss Freestone and the projectionist and the young man working next door
Every single one of them is accounted for
With your terrific security and all, no one else could get in or out of the building
So the question is, who killed Mr McAndrews?
That's why I want you to look at these, Lieutenant
You personally won this award yourself, ma'am?
Indeed she did, Lieutenant
"For Best Documentary Production"
Well, you certainly are a very clever woman, ma'am
That's why she's with us
Very clever indeed
Let's just say I work like an ox
Please sit right here, Lieutenant
Thank you, ma'am
FRANK:
Kay
Under the circumstances, I'm gonna ask something of you
We'd like you to help us by taking over all of Mark's duties, at least for the time being
Of course Anything I can do to help, Mr Flanagan
Good I knew I could count on you
You can start by locking up Clay Gardner in The Broad Land
Oh, Mr Flanagan, I wanted to talk to you about The Professional, the film last night?
I think we should talk about that some other time
Good luck, Lieutenant
Oh, thank you, sir I'm sure it'll be off in a few days
I call it weird, ma'am
All these crazy crank letters
Have you ever told the police about these threats?
Yes, I certainly have
You'll notice that the network gets blamed for everything that's going, be it communism, fascism, atheism, abortion, sex, violence You name it
Up, down or in the middle It's all the same thing
"Support decency or we'll kill you"
Signed in blood
So, naturally, when this happened, it occurred to me
That one of these nuts slipped in here and killed Mr McAndrews?
Well, other attempts have been made, twice on Mr Flanagan
I don't think so, ma'am
Not in this case
Granted, there's a lot of nuts running around, some of them dangerous
Not in this case
You seem very sure, Lieutenant
That's because Mr McAndrews recognized his murderer
He knew the person who shot him
I find that very hard to believe
I don't wanna distress you, ma'am, but there's no doubt about it
I know I had that paper somewhere
Why is there no doubt about it?
We know the angle of the bullet, ma'am
We know that the murderer didn't shoot from the door
He entered the office
I'd say he was 18 feet in by the time he pulled the trigger
Well, why couldn't a stranger be 18 feet into a room?
Well, let me put it to you this way, ma'am
If you were alone in a room at night, lying on a couch, and a stranger entered, wouldn't you take a good look at him?
Wouldn't you wanna see what he looked like?
Yes
That's the point, ma'am
Mr McAndrews didn't bother to take a really good look
It's these glasses, ma'am
He had them up here on his forehead when he was shot
When the murderer came into the room
So Mr McAndrews must've known exactly who that person was, or he would've pushed them down, like this
Because with these type corrections, ma'am, these bifocals, this is the only way that Mr McAndrews could see his killer
If the killer was a stranger, that is
Which he couldn't have been
But I'll keep your theory in mind
Interesting, isn't it, how you can work these small things out if you just think about it?
Like you got a tiny voice whispering right in your ear, trying to tell you who did it
You're a very attentive listener, Lieutenant
Oh, yes, ma'am Why that's all we got to go on
Listen and look, look and listen
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
WALTER:
You see, you watch your counter for the blip and then you stand by for the blip
You mean to tell me that all these years, every time I took Mrs Columbo to the theater, those flashes were on the screen?
They have been on the screen even before Mrs Columbo, Lieutenant
The upper right hand corner
In a regular theater?
A regular theater
If I go to the movies tonight, 8:30, down the block, a dollar and a half, and I walk in and sit down and watch the movie, you mean to tell me that I will see those flashes on the screen?
Right
That goes to show you, you learn something new every day
Now, the flashes tell the projectionist when he's supposed to change his reel
All right, all right, watch
Flash
Now, you tell me when you see the second one
Flash
Mr Mearhead,
I would say you did that like an artist
Listen, you wanna see art, Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, this is art
Isn't that remarkable?
You did that yourself?
That I did, sir
When I was a kid, I used to build model airplanes
I'd start them but I could never finish them
I'd always wreck them
Miss Freestone, she made the changeover last night when you went out for The Broad Land screen tests?
Yeah, about two minutes after I left I checked that counter
You checked the counter,
Miss Freestone, she changed the projector
Did Miss Freestone make the splice, too?
What splice?
You mean the film didn't break?
Isn't this one of those editor's gloves?
Right I mean, she could've fixed the film if anything happened, but nothing happened to the film
You see,
I use these gloves because of the glue
Well, thank you very much, sir
Do you think it would be asking too much if I took one of these things for my nephew?
Sure, help yourself
The kid's 15yearsold and he sold all his stereo stuff to make eightmillimeter movies
When I was a kid in my neighborhood, we had heroes
DiMaggio, Rizzuto
You know who he's got on the wall?
Francis Ford Coppola
(EXCLAIMING)
Sorry, ma'am
Excuse me, Lieutenant
Oh, Walter, you can send those test reels back to Shipping anytime
Oh, those tests, ma'am, the tests, they've already gone back to Shipping
I spoke to the gentleman in charge
Oh
Fine, then
COLUMBO:
Ma'am Ma'am
About those tests that you sent out for last night
Those were tests for a new series called The Broad Land?
Yes, Lieutenant, they were talent tests
Yes, well there's something that I don't understand, ma'am, and maybe I should I probably should
Lord knows I'm not the brightest guy on the force
Another detective, he could cut right through all this
I understand, Lieutenant Just ask your questions
That's the problem, ma'am
When I ask the questions, I know I'm putting you on the spot
It's perfectly all right, Lieutenant
It's your job I appreciate that
Thank you very much, ma'am If only more people felt that way
The question is
Mr Flanagan says that he already approved Clay Gardner to star in that new series
So I had to ask myself, if he already approved him, why would you wanna show him more tests?
You see my problem, ma'am?
Yes, I do, and I wondered exactly the same thing myself
Did you?
Mmmhmm
This time I think you're listening to the wrong little voice in your ear, Lieutenant
I was just following instructions
Mr Flanagan's instructions?
Mr McAndrews' instructions
Written instructions, ma'am?
Verbal instructions, Lieutenant
I see
Well, we certainly can't ask Mr McAndrews, can we?
(ELEVATOR DINGING)
I'm afraid I do have to go, Lieutenant
COLUMBO:
Oh, ma'am
Excuse me, ma'am
I know you're pressed
I don't wanna hold you up
Can we walk and talk?
Let's
I know that Mr McAndrews was an important executive, and I know that CNC is a big television network
But I have no idea what he did all day and night, from what I can see around here
Well, I can hardly speak for his nights, Lieutenant
I didn't mean to imply, ma'am
His days were mostly like mine We run a fire department around here
Do you want to look at some of the flames?
Flames, ma'am?
Yes, mostly we put out fires
LUTHER:
Nancy, monitor two
NANC Y One, please
LUTHER:
Thank you, sweetheart
Yeah, now, that's the angle I want for the third position
MAN:
Looking nice kids Looking very good
Start from the top and I'll watch it up here
Oh, Kay, we've already lost two hours
Where is she?
Luther will tell you
Oh, Lieutenant, I'll be busy for a minute Just help yourself
Don't worry about me, ma'am
(SHUSHING)
Luther?
LUTHER:
Coming down
You can take a break now, Nancy Thanks
NANCY:
All right, everybody, five minutes, please
Where are we?
Replace her, Kay
Valerie?
She's never gonna make it Not a live show Not in this world
Oh, come on, we're on tomorrow night
She's terrified, she's hysterical
She's losing her mind I mean, she doesn't even understand that this is not an MGM sound stage 20 years ago
She hates the blocking, she hates the camera, she hates me
You, I don't know about
Look, a few times a day she'll have a nice rush of confidence for 10 minutes and then she'll remember it's a live show, bite one of the dancers on the leg and run to her dressing room and hide
Aside from all that, her work is lousy
Where is she?
Dressing room
Luther, is she on anything?
Oh, please
COLUMBO:
You mean it's gonna be live TV, just the way it used to be?
TECHNICAL DIRECTOR:
A little bit better, Lieutenant, we hope
This is where the director will sit Here, sit down
This is a technical director's console
Does that bother you?
(STAMMERING) That's just whiplash
I mean, I think it's a whiplash
My doctor thinks it's a whiplash
The chiropractor, he thinks I just got a bad massage
And my wife's osteopath, he thinks it might be a back problem
It doesn't look like a back problem
That's what the orthopedic man said
Listen, all these screens for just one show?
That's a line monitor That's what's going on the air
Preview monitor is what the director wants up next and those are what the four cameras see
I do the switching
Hey, all these beautiful machines in here, all these buttons to push
I know it costs millions and I know that everybody works very hard But I gotta tell you the truth
To me, it looks like fun
It is, but I wouldn't swear to it in court
And Miss Freestone, she understands all about this, too?
I'll tell you about that If there's one thing worse than a television lady who thinks she knows everything, it's a television lady who knows everything
I'll see you later, Lieutenant
(WHISTLING THIS OLD MAN)

Valerie
KAY:
Val, it's Kay
Whose side are you on?
Whose do you think?
Prove it
You can keep the key to my apartment
Oh, Kay Give me a hug
Oh, I thought you'd never get here
Did Luther get over his snit yet?
How about yours?
Big deal
I tried to tell that genius where to put my key light and the roof fell in
Big man from New York
Luther's very good He's the best in the business for live shows
He'll make you look like a million
A million years old
Is that how you feel?
Want your key back?
Val, are you clean?
Oh, my God
I look like a junky, huh?
I've had no booze, no pills, no sniff and no smoke
Except these damn things, that's all
(SOBBING)
Can you look at me, babe?
How scared are you?
I'm terrified
I can't do it, Kay I just don't know how to do it anymore
I don't know what you have to do
Sing, dance, be funny in front of 40 million people
I'd do it myself if I had the time
Come on
LUTHER:
And then we'll go to four after the crane shot
Luther Mmm?
Take a look at this
What's that?
LUTHER:
Oh, boy
Eddie, give me a tight twoshot on Kay and Valerie, would you?
Valerie Kirk
Valerie Kirk?
Wait till I tell my wife
Hey, boss, you want a willing worker?
Well, what are we waiting for?
And the lighting is terrific
I don't believe it
What are you waiting for?
Lets go to work
Anything else, maestro?
Yeah How about walking on water?
Oh, yeah
LUTHER Valerie, lm coming right down Wait for me
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)
(CRASHING)
Ma'am?
Lieutenant, you frightened me
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am
Your secretary said you were coming here
I'll just take that
Are you supposed to take that off?
Well, I thought I'd cheat for a while
An hour won't hurt What do you think?
I think you're very attractive without it, but that's not a medical opinion
Well, I'll tell you, ma'am, it's the nicest opinion I've heard yet
She said, your secretary, that you used to live here
Yes
My mother raised three of us in this place
I guess nothing sends you scurrying back to your roots like somebody else's death, does it?
Oh, I thought, ma'am, now that you have this new, important job you might have paid a visit just to see how far you've come
Excuse me I'll just get another chair
May I, ma'am?
Let's dine by candlelight, Lieutenant
That'd be very nice, ma'am
You know, I always knew this place was small but I never realized it was quite this tiny
Four of us cramped in here Never a chance to be alone
I took a trip a few years ago
Took Mrs Columbo back to the house where I grew up
It looked all shrunken
I had five brothers and one sister, Miss Freestone, and that was really terrific
There was always someone around for company
We were never lonely
You're a very special man, Lieutenant
You accept things as they are
I try to change them
That's to your credit, ma'am
Your success and ambition and all
Now, I'm supposed to ask you questions about all that
You're supposed to?
Well, nobody told me to, but that's the way I'm supposed to do my job
They're certainly not personal
Whenever anyone says it's not personal, that's exactly when it's very personal
It's not by choice, ma'am
Sometimes I get all tense when I have to do it
Well, then that's your problem, Lieutenant
We have to do something to relieve some of that tension
Oh Be careful, ma'am
I won't touch your neck Just relax
(GROANING)
That's a real relief
What I wanted to ask you, ma'am, would you have gotten this new job, in charge of West Coast production, if Mr McAndrews hadn't been murdered?
Go on, ma'am You're not hurting me
No I don't think Mark would have given me the job
May I ask, ma'am, why you say that?
He never mentioned it
Now the fact is, he never mentioned it to any of his executive staff
But you were his main assistant
Perhaps Mr Flanagan had objections
Well, I don't mean to pin you down, ma'am, but it was Mr Flanagan who gave you your promotion
Yes
But it's not a permanent promotion, Lieutenant Remember that
Well, Mr Flanagan told me that it would have been okay with him if the murdered man had given you the job
Then it was Mark's decision
I hear those little voices going around in your ear, Lieutenant, asking could I possibly have miraculously murdered Mark for his job?
Oh, no, ma'am I don't think that at all
You were up in the projection booth
And I don't think people kill people for just a job
Even an important job like yours
A little lower down, ma'am, if you don't mind
Either there was no motive at all, like in these crazy kind of murders that you read about in the newspaper, or there was a very good motive
One that makes terrific sense
And that's what keeps going around in my mind
The motive
No, I couldn't think those thoughts about you, Miss Freestone
Not as long as all you had with Mr McAndrews was a business relationship
Well, I'm sure you've checked that out with the executive staff, haven't you, Lieutenant?
Not by choice, ma'am
I wish I could help you, Lieutenant
You have, Miss Freestone
I'm gonna try sleeping tonight without this thing
Well then, if you'll forgive me
I've had enough of my olden times
Yes, ma'am
How do you like that?
I almost forgot again
That item that I found on the victim's desk
The one that I lost Well, I found it again
It was a slip of paper
Like a note that he was making to himself
Some numbers and the capital letter "K"
Take a look at this, ma'am Maybe you can help me
COLUMBO:
You see the capital letter "K"
and the numbers 280, 450 with a circle around it,
240 and 230
Now, the "K" with those numbers
Does that mean anything to you, ma'am?
Not a thing
No
You see, the numbers part,
I think that they form some kind of a pattern
I think they got something in common and it's right on the tip of my tongue but I can't put my finger on it
You can't help me?
Sorry
Well, thanks a lot anyway
What's your first name, ma'am?
Katherine
But they call you Kay
Yes
And there's this capital letter "K" on the note
Yes
Does that ring a bell, ma'am?
No
Nothing at all?
No, no help at all
In this case, the "K" must simply be a "K"
Can't blame me for trying, ma'am
COLUMBO:
You see, Mrs Columbo, she never believed the doctor right from the start
She claimed I was sleeping in a draft
Well, last night she insisted upon closing the windows
Well, I woke up this morning, I tell you, Sergeant, my neck felt terrific
That's very good, Lieutenant
I was getting so desperate that I was gonna go to this clinic where my brotherinlaw goes for his back problem
What they did, they said they had to deaden the nerves in his nose
His nose, Lieutenant?
His nose
They stuck a needle in his nose
Sticking right out of his nose, like this
That's how he had to walk around, with a needle in his nose
What do you think of that, Sergeant?
That's very interesting, Lieutenant
I think so, too
Don't let me hold you up, Sergeant You go ahead
Yes, sir
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
Mr Mearhead?
Oh, hi, Lieutenant Come on in
I just wanted to say that I dropped the glove off for my nephew
He figures it'll improve his editing 1000%
Well, you tell him he ought to become a surgeon
That way he won't have to see so much blood
You got any opinions about violence on television?
Well, I work nights a lot
I wanna tell you something The other night, I come back from Film Shipping and the first thing I see is some guy blowing his brains out
I mean, you think that's right?
I got a change coming up
You know, it's crazy, Mr Mearhead, but since I've been hanging around here I think I've become a button freak
Buttons and switches Mmmhmm
You don't suppose I could try to make one of these changeovers myself?
I don't see why not All it is, is a writer watching an old movie
All right, when you see your first flash, buttons up
Button up Round before your dowser
Dowser up
On your second flash, Lieutenant, button here, button there, press
Button, button Dowser down
Down on dowser Left light off
So, on the first flash, buttons up?
Buttons up
And the dowser up
WALTER:
Flash coming up
COLUMBO:
First flash
Flash up
Second flash coming up
Second flash Now the buttons go on the flash or before?
Did I miss?
It goes on the flash, Lieutenant On the flash
There it is On the flash
Okay
What happened?
WRITER ON SPEAKER Walter, we lost our film in here Whats going on?
Walter, can you hear me?
What the hell are you playing at in there?
Walter
Sorry Excuse me

Can I talk to you?
Certainly, Sergeant
Can we go in here?
I'd rather not
(WHISPERING)

Uhhuh
Got anything to go?
No, nothing to go

You brought it in this morning
(BELL DINGING)
Yeah, I wanted it for tonight but I had to work late
I'm working late myself on your television set
Well, you see, sir, working nights, I don't get to see much television
Mrs Columbo, she does a lot of reading and she takes a lot of night school courses
So the real TV fan in the house, that's my dog
(MOOD Y JAZZ PLAYING ON T V)
Boy, you got it going That's terrific
He likes television He can't get enough of it
You see that You like that?
He like it?
Yes, sir, I think he likes it
How do you know he likes it?
He never saw nothing yet he didn't like
Well, if he didn't like it, how would you know he didn't like it?
Well, he would look very bored, sir
All droopy and listless
I'll tell you the reason that we wanted to see TV tonight is, we wanted to see the second half of The Valerie Kirk Show
Not on
I said it's not on This is the channel
They got something else on instead
Something called The Professional
Oh, The Professional
Would you believe I know the lady that made that show?
Not a bad picture Spy stuff
Spies Your favorite
You gonna start that again?
Come on, we gotta Up where the view is here
All right, move over That's it
There, are you comfortable?
Come on, up here where you can see
Is that all right?
(GUN FIRING ON T V)
Sorry, Lieutenant Still not right
Not bad, sir
Not bad at all
You just keep working
I could fix you up with a terrific new one Under $400
Your dog would love it
No
I gotta buy a new bumper for my car, maybe a new pair of shoes
I think I'll pass

He's been out all day I'll keep trying
What time did the carousel location wrap up last night?
They didn't
Get me that genius Benjamin
(COLUMBO STRIKING A MATCH)
Lieutenant
You're working rather late tonight, aren't you?
Yes, ma'am
Working late like a television executive
That's a very impressive desk, ma'am
You could run the world from a desk like that
The world doesn't count Just the West Coast
Through for the day, ma'am?
No Not quite
Mr McAndrews,
he wasn't married?
He wasn't married
Was he ever married, ma'am?
I don't know
Engaged?
Engaged?
Engaged, ma'am
I don't know
What about women?
Did he run around a lot?
MADGE:
Kay
Can I help you?
Yes, I'll be moving in here tomorrow
Would you please call the beach location and let them know that I'm coming out there tonight?
And then that would be all
Okay Good night
I was asking, ma'am, if he ran around with a lot of women
I don't know
He must've had companions
Would you say that women found Mr McAndrews attractive?
I'm sure his secretaries did
You, personally, did you find him attractive?
Yes,
Mark was a very attractive man, in his way
You're an attractive man, in your way, too
I guess I told you that
Yes, ma'am
Please sit down
Now, I ask people questions and they answer
Now, I ask them the same question another time and they answer in a different way
That's not because they're lying, ma'am
I know that and I appreciate that
There's been a death
People are in shock, confusion
People misremember
They misspeak themselves
Have I said something wrong?
Well, let's go all over again
You said you knew nothing about how Mr McAndrews spent his nights
That had nothing to do with you?
Mmmhmm
Sometimes we dined together if we worked late
And dates, girls
Maybe somebody he lived with
We never asked each other
Well, that holds with what you said before
But I'm surprised, ma'am
And I don't mind telling you, I find it all very troubling
Because I was at Mr McAndrews' house yesterday
The beach house
And some cleaning was delivered, some slacks and this blazer
And that's the problem, ma'am
This blazer
You see, I noticed that the buttons are on the wrong side
It buttons right over left, the wrong side for a man's jacket that is, because this is a woman's blazer
There's a tailor's label in it
And I checked on that This jacket was made for you
It's your jacket
Would you like to try it on, ma'am?
No
Well, since you were sending your cleaning out from Mr McAndrews' house,
I can only assume
All right, Lieutenant
You've done very good work You've caught me in a lie
I would say so, ma'am, yes
Well, the corporation being what it is,
Mark and I didn't feel it would be very discrete to advertise our relationship
Now, you can understand that, can't you?
Yes, ma'am, I can understand that
But being discrete with the police, that's something else again
Is it so really important to the police?
Well, you might have been able to tell us things
Now, we're gonna have to talk about that
All right
I'm due on location now, so perhaps we can talk about it later on tomorrow
As you say, you're not racing the clock and I am
I guess another day won't make that much difference
And I promise not to change my address or renew my passport or leave town
or ever tell another lie
Well, you weren't even under oath, ma'am
But what we have here, it's a matter of civic responsibility
All the way down, ma'am?
All the way down
I mean, if everybody kept their little secrets from the police, we'd be forever getting to the bottom of our cases
My goodness
I'm not supposed to do this in the elevator
Excuse me?
I was talking about cooperation, ma'am
I had a case once A man was cheating on his wife and he was a very important witness, but he was afraid to tell me
I understand
I hope you do, ma'am
I apologize, Lieutenant I hope you forgive me
Well, it's not my place, ma'am
Oh, just so we have a meeting of minds
Oh, about that note, the one that was on Mr McAndrews' desk
The one with all the numbers on it, the 450, the 280, the 230, the 250
Nothing to worry about, ma'am
It came to me Those were just some automobile models, different kinds of Mercedes cars
So I guess, Mr McAndrews, he must have been in the market for a new car
Aren't you coming, ma'am?
No, there's a phone call I forgot to make
Good night, Lieutenant

Mr Flanagan Of course
All right if we sit in the car?
If you like
Oh, Carl
Does this bother you?
No, not at all
I want to talk about some of the difficulties you've been having
Valerie Kirk
I understand she's a close personal friend
Yes, that's true
I also understand that her director tried to warn you about her incompetence
That's also true
Well, we'll put that aside
The decision to use The Professional as a replacement for Valerie's show,
I'm sure you know the ratings were very poor
Well, under the circumstances
Well, you created the circumstances
Now, Kay, nobody knows better than you that The Professional cost us $1,600,000, including a second run
Now, you wasted the first one
You threw away an impressive film
I was under the impression that you didn't like that film at all
You had no right to make an assumption about what I like
We'll We'll put that aside, too
I've also been told that you're
You're planning to
To move into Mark's office tomorrow
Why not?
I'll be needing more space
The office comes with the job
But you don't, Kay
Nobody ever told you that your present duties were permanent
Also, I question your taste in leaping so quickly behind a dead man's desk
Well, I seem to have made quite a big hit
All in all
Now, you don't have to rush looking for a new position
We'll, let's say, make it official at the end of the month?
I'll try to consult you in the press release
Do you expect hysterics?
I hope not
I'm as tough as you are
I'll survive
And you'll want me back
I hope so

I cant speak right now, Lieutenant
Oh, I get it
The cameras
Oh, you're up in that control place
You can see me on those big screens?
lm right You can see me Right, maam?
Lieutenant, can we speak tomorrow at the office?
No, I I'll call you
I definitely promise I'll do that, Lieutenant I'll call you
Well, its very important that we talk tonight, maam
I'm afraid that's impossible lm afraid III have to insist, maam I really have to do that
I can't accept that
I can't speak now!
Please bear with me, maam
It has to do with the car
The 450SL, the silver one thats registered in your name
The one that Mr McAndrews bought Thats all very puzzling, maam
And there are other things
Theres your picture, The Professional, and this connection with whoever murdered Mr McAndrews
And there is a connection lm pretty sure of that, maam lm afraid its necessary
I know youre under a lot of pressure, maam, but there are these things that we should talk about tonight
I dont like to have to talk to you this way, maam
I know how you feel
But its very hard not being able to see you
(KAY SCREAMING)
Ma'am?
I told you I have work to do, Lieutenant
This show needs a lot of work
The script needs work
Ma'am,
like I asked you before, this new job you got, would you have it if Mr McAndrews hadn't been murdered?
No
I already told you, I don't think so
I don't think so either
Is that why he bought you the car?
Sort of a parting gift considering your relationship, like he was getting rid of you?
I find that very intrusive, Lieutenant
And I don't think you have a right
Oh, I have the right, ma'am
But I understand your feelings
Please, keep bearing with me, ma'am
Sit down
You know, maybe it was fate
But I came within 30 seconds of not seeing your TV movie The Professional
But I did see it, ma'am
And I noticed something very peculiar
So peculiar that I had the projectionist run it again today
And that Technical Director that I met, he made this up for me on television tape
It's your movie, ma'am
The part where the fella's in the hotel room and he's gonna shoot himself
Now, the Technical Director told me that there would be an eject button, blue
Yes
And a slot right here
And an RT button one
Here
There it is ma'am
(MOOD Y JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
Now, we'll just watch this together, ma'am
There it is now, there
There he is He's by the sink
And there he's washing
There, right there, you see the flash?
Yes, Lieutenant, it's a cue blip
And now the second one
There There's the second cue
Now that's the cue for the projectionist to make his changeover
Am I right, Miss Freestone?
Yes, Lieutenant, I'm very impressed
Excuse me, ma'am I don't mean to interrupt
Right there, that high shot where the man's lying on the hotel bed
That's where the new reel begins
Just watch it, ma'am
(GUN FIRING ON T V)
And there, that's where the man commits suicide
And that's what the projectionist saw right after he got back from the shipping room
That's what Mr Mearhead told me
He came back into the booth, looked up and he saw a man blowing his brains out
You had to make the changeover right before Mr Mearhead got back from the shipping room
Not a few minutes earlier, not sometime before,
like he thought
I'm afraid, in this case,
Walter must be confused, Lieutenant
He checked the footage counter before he left
You must've fooled him about that, ma'am
What I think,
I think you changed the footage counter to place yourself in the projection booth at the time of the murder
But really, ma'am, you had time enough to leave the booth and get to Mr McAndrews' office
Just enough time
Because when you rushed back to make the changeover, that's when you must've dropped this glove
by the projector
It's Walter's glove
Walter's projection booth
I don't think you have a case against Walter
No, ma'am Not the way he kept that booth, so immaculate and all
I don't see him just throwing a glove on the floor
And the lab says that this glove has powder burns on it
And then there's the gun
Mr McAndrews' gun, the gun that murdered him
The one that you put on the elevator
Our people found it this afternoon
And then we took a second gun, one that looked like this gun and we put it back on the elevator
But we put it where it could be seen as if the continuous movement of the elevator had jiggled it so now it became visible
Watch this, ma'am
That's a TV picture of where we placed the second gun, just before you got on the elevator with me, ma'am
There it is Now, there
That's the way it looked right after you got back on the elevator and came off it
And you'll notice, there is no gun
Not anymore
Because you got rid of it
But this gun
This is the gun that you murdered him with
I see
I'm sure you do, ma'am
It's very odd
They say there's a great sense of relief that comes when something like this is over
I don't feel that at all
Quite the opposite
Will you be taking me?
Yes, ma'am, into town After that
After that, I think I know what will happen
I'll fight
I'll survive
I might even win
Yes, ma'am
Should we turn this off, ma'am?
It doesn't matter
Yes, ma'am, the power shortage
I think I know the right button

Yeah.
You do.
- What case files?
- They were locked away.
Hidden in sheriff Cobb's old cabin.
That's weird because he kept all active case files in the office.
Well, maybe he was afraid that someone would find out.
Find out what?
Sheriff Cobb was investigating a formation of an espionage consortium right here in Eureka.
Spies?
I mean, um...
Vinspresso?
No, thanks.
It...
Police matter, Vin.
Right.
Hmm.
- Let me see.
- Okay.
[Clears throat] It's exciting stuff, but this just scratches the surface.
I checked out all of other Jo's case files when we jumped into this time line, and I... she made no mention of this investigation.
Obviously.
It was top secret, but maybe you can solve the case now.
We already did.
Beverly Barlowe's a spy.
Case closed.
Maybe...
But sheriff Cobb suspected a spy consortium so yes, Beverly Barlowe is gone, but...
Who was she working with?
Huh?
There's only one way to find out.
This is great.
But I think we're gonna need more buckets.
No, we need a new roof.

Yeah, well, it's on the to-do list.
Oh, oh, oh.

It's not lipstick.
It's a copa-cabana.
Well, I thought...
I was hoping we'd be in more of a Barry White sort of mood.
No, Jack.
It's a compact portable automatic cabana.
I-I packed it so that we could use it on the beach.
No, no a.I. For...
I saw Fargo once almost get swallowed by his mu-tent.
So I think...
I think I got this covered.
Yeah.
I'm going with this.
No, no.
I can fix this.
This is a t-a-r-p.
Tarp, right?
And if we tack this up above our little love nest, we will be fine.
And this won't devour you whole.
[Sighs] Yeah.
If you want any "devouring" in your future,
I would hurry up, sheriff.
Where's my hammer?
Sheriff Cobb was definitely on to something.
Beverly Barlowe is his star suspect.
But what about the other names?
I cross-referenced all the G.D. employees with his investigation, and they've either already left Eureka or been redacted.
Well, maybe it really is a closed case after all.
Uh...
Hmm...
Not yet.
- So you ready for me?
- I'm ready.
[Jazzy music]
♪
Hi.
Mmm.
Well, this wasn't exactly what I pictured for our honeymoon, but I do like the sound of the rain.
See, it's not such a bad place.
It has potential.
[Roof creaking]
[Both grunting and gasping]
[Screams]
Oh, oh.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Here, take...
Well, you said you liked the rain.
This body is super bendy.
Yeah, I can see that.
Um, and you should probably start referring to it as "my body."
Oh, right.
I'm just glad all my parts are working.
Test my grip.
- Can you feel it?
- Oh, I can feel it.
Excellent.
How about this?
Lips definitely working.
We should make sure.
Just in case.
Shh, shh, shh.
- What's wrong?
- Qu... qu... quiet.
Quiet, quiet.
They're listening.
Who?
Them.
They trapped us in a computer construct.
No, no, no.
Holly.
Not anymore.
We got out.
All of us.
Remember?
You just think you did.
None of this is real.
Doug...
We have to get out of here.
[Birds twittering]
Well, we're still here.
Yeah.
And...
[Birds chirping]
Looks like it stopped raining.
- Yay.
- Yay.
Oh, I know.
It was a rough night.
But the sun's out.
It's a new day.
What do you say we...
We make some breakfast in bed and just start over.
I'll make some coffee.
Okay.
[Sighs]
Wow.
[Pipes groan]
[Laughs]
There's, uh...
There's no water.
What?
[Pipes groan]
Oh, the storm must've clogged the pump.
Ah, yeah.
So no coffee, no shower.
Don't worry, I'll fix it.
- Okay.
- I'll fix it.
[Sighs]
She doesn't remember what happened last night.
I-I put her to bed, finally, and she woke up, back to normal.
Normal?
Dude, she has a serious case of the munchies right now.
I guess it stands to reason because she's been through some pretty extreme experiences lately.
So there's bound to be some confusion, but...
No, no.
It was more than that.
She really believed we were still in virtual Eureka.
Mmm.
God, I miss Vincent's food.
Is there anything better than eating when you have a body?
Well... oh.
Well, except for, you know.
Hmm.
Now it's awkward.
So, when can I get out of here?
Let me just tell you, there is nothing like dying to make you hungry to live.
Um, we'll get you out of here as soon as we can.
We just want to make sure that you're okay.
- Hmm.
- Why don't you...
Okay, let's...
I'm afraid to let her leave before we know she's stable.
All right, well, let's help with the transition then.
Um, why don't you bring in some of her favorite things?
Ah, some music, photos, your dorky little DD game.
That is not dorky.
Really?
Yeah, it is, actually.
Whatever.
It will help her feel comfortable.
- Holly?
- Hmm?
[Crunches] I'll be back in a bit.
Hmm.
Ooh, ooh.
Bring me some chocolate.
Where did you get this?
Sorry, Henry.
It's classified.
On the down low.
[Laughs] I see.
Do you know what it is?
Looks like a data storage device.
Old design.
But I tell you what, um, why don't I scan it and get some stats.
Thanks.
So, um, it must be nice to have Grace back in town.
[Scanner trills] Yeah, you have no idea.
[Scanner beeps] Ooh, that was quick.
Huh.
It's made of lithium niobate crystal.
For an optical data storage system.
Optical data.
Hologram.
[Gasps]
Maybe they used the disc for secret communica...
Case.
They?
Uh...
For example.
You really need an off switch.
What's going on, Jo?
We think we may have uncovered evidence of possible espionage in Eureka.
Really?
Ready for a round of DD?
Holly?
Holly?
Oh, no.
- Hey, there.
- Hey.
You left early.
Yeah, I promised Jo that I would, uh, get this up and running.
What does she want with that?
Well, she's come into possession of an old optical data disc, and she needs something to play it on.
- Really?
- Hmm.
Apparently, it was a part of an unsolved investigation by sheriff Cobb.
He suspected spies among us.
But that would have been, like, years ago.
Yeah, but considering our recent experience with Beverly Barlowe and senator Wen, espionage is still something that we need to take seriously.
Oh, of course.
So, um, I guess you are too busy then to have breakfast with me.
Um, it has been years, and I've missed, oh, so many breakfasts.
Both: [Laughing]
Yeah, it looks like the pump jobbie is just, uh, jammed up by the frickin' sticky thing.
Uh, Jack, let me call the engineering lab.
They can install a portable solar shower by lunch.
Allie, you don't need a PhD to fix this.
Couldn't hurt.
Cobe...
You know what, I'm your better half now or the very least, your other half.
And I think you should let me protect and provide a little.
[Pipe squeaking] Like...
This.
- I'm impressed.
- That's nothing.
[Water trickling]
I feel better already.
[Sighs]
Oh.
Mmm...
It's great, Jack.
Hmm...
Ahh!
Ahh!
[Pipes groaning]
[Screaming]
Ah!
Ah!
Jack!
- Allie?
- Ah!
Oh...
Jack.
G.D. is huge.
Holly could be anywhere.
Jo and Andy are on their way.
People are going to freak if they see her back from the dead.
It's Global Dynamics.
They've seen worse.
I never should have left her alone.
Fargo, we'll find her.
Let's just split up.
We can cover more ground that way, all right?
This hard drive hasn't been used for years.
I'm not quite sure what kind of image we're going to get.
Let's give it a shot.
This is so exciting.
Who's it going to be?
At ease, deputy.
All right.
Here we go.
[Device hums]
[Faint speech]
Can you make it any clearer?
Well, I can try.
[Distorted speech]
- Henry!
- Ooh!
Jo thought it was a cold case, but now it's red-hot.
Henry Deacon's restoring the evidence, and once that happens...
Vincent...
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
I heard there was a spy among us.
Would you keep it down?
This is an active investigation.
Is it true that when Henry repairs the disc, you'll expose the spy who sabotaged the hard drive?
Where are you getting this?
I am the eyes and ears of this town.
And the mouth, apparently.
Jo, the people have a right to know.
[Cell phone chimes] Yeah.
I have to get back to G.D. you...
Zip it.
Well, at least we got you cleaned up.
Right?
And Vince has outdone himself.
He's got homemade croissants, he's got champagne, he's got some sort of seafood something or other.
Great, sounds delicious.
Bring it on.
I'm famished.
[Sighs]
Or...
We catch our breakfast.
What?
Doesn't that sound like fun?
Huh?
I saw a reel and a rod in the shed.
[Laughs] Now you want to fish?
Sure.
I saw a bush.
We can get the berries.
We could make jam.
Jack, I am tired and hungry.
Do not play with me.
The seal on the food was...
Not airtight.
[Exasperated chuckle]
Ants?
A few...
Thousand.
You know what, I'm...
I'm...
That's it, I'm done.
- Allie, would you...
- Jack, really.
Really.
Because I know that this is what you want.
But this is our honeymoon.
Did you ever even stop and consider what I wanted?
Of course.
You wanted a romantic getaway.
No, I want a roof.
I want running water.
Maybe even room service, I don't know.
Call me superficial,
I don't think that's unreasonable to ask.
No, it's not unreasonable.
It's just not me.
Well, this isn't me.
Jack, this place is unbearable.
You know, I know you want to keep it old school, fine, but I'm dropping out.
You can't drop out of our honeymoon.
This isn't our honeymoon.
This is a disaster.
You're right.
It is.
I'm going to call a travel agent.
Okay?
I'm...
I'm going to book us some place tropical.
With... with room service and no ants.
What I was trying to do was do something romantic.
And... and nothing turned out the way that I wanted it.
I know you did, honey.
I-I know you tried.
[Beeping]
[Sighs]
We have 40 messages.
- From the kids?
- No.
People in town.
Something about exposing a spy.
What spy?
I think we missed something.
Oh, Henry.
Hey, sweetheart.
Um, I was looking for you.
Do you need some help?
What, is something wrong?
Grace.
[Sighs]
You weren't restoring the data.
No.
I told Vincent to spread the word to encourage whoever did this to try to finish the job.
Well, um...
This doesn't look good, does it?
Come with me.
Hey.
Henry, we just heard about Grace.
Jack, um...
Your honeymoon?
Not as devastating as this, but close.
You, uh...
You okay?
- No.
- [Sighs]
She didn't protest.
She didn't even try to explain.
That she was involved with Beverly and senator Wen?
I don't know, I mean,
I came back from 1947 married to a woman that... that I didn't know.
Yeah, but a spy?
I mean, you really think she'd betray her friends and colleagues?
Look, think about it, the way she left town after the Astraeus was found, saying that she was so upset?
I don't know.
I...
[Sighs]
I don't know what to think.
Sorry.
Hmm.
Me too.
Holly, where are you?
Doug?
Holly?
Whatcha doing back there?
I was looking for you.
I don't know what's happening to me.
We're...
We're going to fix it.
But I can't tell what's real and not real anymore.
Hey.
This is real.
I'm real.
I-I promise.
You're going to be fine.
Is it true?
In this town, what's true can be a very tricky concept.
How could you?
Henry is in shock.
All this time, we're looking for Beverly and...
Yes, so was I. It's why I left.
Do you know where she is?
No.
Did you help her hijack my brain?
Did you help her set up the abduction of the Astraeus and the crew?
No!
I thought that I missed four years of my life, that I lost Jack and the kids to Jo.
And you knew?
Allison, I didn't know anything.
[Sighs]
I...
I wish that I could believe you.
Hmm.
[Sniffling]
I want to speak to my husband.
[Device beeps]
Um...
You're... you're...
You're doing great, Holly.
Um...
Can you get...
Can you just hang tight for one minute?
Sure, Zane.
If that's who you really are.
Um.
It's a synaptic disorder.
Her neurotransmitters are degrading.
No chance she just needs time to adjust?
The biochemical structure of her brain would keep on breaking down.
If we wait, she could lose touch with reality for good.
So what do we do?
We run the neural transfer again.
But you said we can't.
Well, we can't reverse the process, but now that her neural patterns have been encoded in her body, we can try to reboot her.
[Device trilling]
Hi.
I just heard.
How is she?
Well, she's alive.
For now.
Can't believe she's actually here.
Yeah, but she's slipping away.
Yeah, but not if I can help it.
Fargo, let me try it.
Okay.
Can I say hello?
Yeah, maybe a familiar face would help.
It's okay.
You okay?
No?
You okay?
- [Gasps]
- How you doing?
[Distorted] How you doing?
[Crying]
Okay.
Get back.
Get back.
Give me the gun.
Holly.
You can trust me.
Not this time.
Holly... sheriff Carter would never hurt you.
He already did.
He's a bad man.
No, I'm a good man.
A good...
No!
You're... he's trying to fool us.
- Like the rest of them.
- No, no, no, no, no.
Holly, he's... he's real.
All the N.P.C.s are gone now.
They're not.
You'll see.
They're coming for us.
But I'm on to you.
- Holly...
- Easy, easy.
Holly, please.
Put down the gun.
[Breathes heavily]
[Whimpering] I'm...
I'm so sorry.
[Sobbing] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
Help her.
You're doing the right thing.
I hope so.
You're giving her a chance at a real life.
You ready?
No.
But do I have a choice?
[Tapping keys]
[Device hums]
Her B.P.'s dropping.
Her pulse ox too.
She can get through.
[Electrical buzzing]
Zane, it's too much for her.
Shut it down.
We have to see it through.
[Whimpering]
She's stabilizing.
[Beeping]
What now?
Now we wait to see who she is when she wakes up.
You came back.
[Sighs]
You're my wife.
I'm sorry you found out this way.
I never wanted you to find out at all.
Grace.
You got to help me.
I'm... it...
How did you even get involved?
It doesn't...
Doesn't matter now.
No, it does matter to me.
I mean, you have to tell me what happened.
Were you coerced, did Beverly's people threaten you?
No.
No.
There was a time when I believed in their mission to monitor G.D.
But when their tactics became destructive,
I quit.
While you were stealing classified information.
After sharing information years ago.
But who knows what Beverly took and adapted to steal the Astraeus.
I mean, you saw what it did to those people.
I was Captain of that ship.
Those people were my crew, Henry.
Because senator Wen appointed you.
No.
I had no idea that she was working with Beverly, much less what they were planning.
Then who else was involved?
Ah!
There was someone on that disc that you tried to destroy, and I can restore it.
Henry, Henry, please.
Don't do that.
Why?
Who are you protecting?
You.
You introduced me to Beverly Barlowe.
We both shared classified information together.
You taught me everything I know.
I have to write about this for the G.D. archives, but I need a good title.
How about the second coming of Holly Marten?
Or is it the third?
Ah, that sounds pretentious.
And borderline offensive.
I'll stick with something scientific.
Oh.
Hey, sleepyhead.
It's about time you woke up.
How are you?
Fully present and accounted for.
Her vitals are strong.
Her neurotransmitters are healthy.
There's no signs of degeneration.
She's back.
Wh... when can she get out of here?
Soon, but let's just lay low.
Make sure everything's still working properly, all right?
I know one thing that's working properly.
Amen for that.
[Clears throat]
Why in the world would you come back to the house of horrors?
[Laughs]
Well, given what the other couples in town are going through, this didn't look half bad.
You kidding?
It was fully awful.
True.
But...
I look at what Fargo is willing to do for Holly and what Henry is going through for Grace.
[Clears throat] and what you tried to do for me.
And all I could think is any place is the right place as long as I'm with you.
- I got a surprise for you.
- Oh, no, no, no.
[Laughs] No more surprises.
It...
I'm going to be installing a solar-heated shower.
Oh.
I know, it's a little high-tech, but I think it's good.
Nothing more as long as we don't lose the rugged everyman quality.
You know how much I love that.
I do.
You're going to find that this roof isn't going to fix itself.
Well, then I better go strap on the tool belt so I can help you.
[Laughs] Oh, but wait.
There's one thing you have to promise me.
Next trip...
Fiji.
Okay.
I want to tell you...
I love you.
- Previously on Eureka...
- We could all be in some totally advanced computer construct that just looks and feels like the real world, and we wouldn't even know it.
Please dispose of Dr. Marten, respectfully and securely.
You reactivated the matrix mainframe?
You didn't tell her what we're doing, did you?
Relax.
No one's gonna find out.
The mainframe has been tracking the Z-waves of the Astraeus crew, but I found one that's still active inside the program.
Holly?
Doug?
Who'd you see?
- I saw her.
- What?
Oh, my God.
She's not just a damaged memory file, Zane.
I think Holly's alive.
I think that's what they're gonna need.
- I've got two more...
- Okay.
- I'll talk to Jerry and see.
- Are they already set up?
Is it straight?
It's straight.
Okay, but what do you think of the flowers?
Too cheerful?
Like, I can always get calla lilies.
No, I think Holly would love 'em.
Okay.
Are you sure that that picture is straight?
Jo.
Everything looks great.
I just know that today is going to be really hard on Fargo, and I want everything to be perfect.
Right in there.
[Electric drilling]
[Background chatter]
Perfect.
Mount the next node up there.
We can get supplementary coverage from the one down the hall.
Excuse me.
What's up with the balls?
- Nodes.
- Nodes.
- You must be sheriff Carter.
- Yes.
Hi.
Major William Shaw, department of defense.
I'm with special projects security.
And you are?
Wondering why you're drilling holes in my facility, sir.
You're looking well, Lupo.
The sergeant and I served together in Afghanistan.
Ah.
It's good to see you again, sir.
But what brings you here?
I'm here to install Panop,
G.D.'s new security system.
[Electronic buzzing]
I sent Dr. Fargo numerous memos.
I'll go talk to him.
You and your team are welcome to wait outside.
We're on a pretty tight schedule.
Major, you're not putting those in here today.
Not today.
My apologies.
We'll start with the rest of the facility.
Thank you.
All right, gentlemen, we'll start in sector four.
Pack up.
Yes, sir.
Fargo...
Wow.
Um, you doing okay?
Yeah, just wishing clip-ons were back in style.
I had an awesome one in seventh grade.
- It had robots.
- No, I mean with today.
And Holly.
Oh, right, yeah, well, you know, I'm managing.
Taking it one day at a time.
You know how long the ceremony's gonna be?
Because I have got a ton of work to do.
I'm sure that Henry will be respectful of both Holly's memory and people's time.
- Are they ready?
- Almost.
Fargo, major Shaw is here about the Panop installation.
Oh.
Whoops.
That was today?
I have an e-memo here somewhere.
You know, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.
Now you just take care of yourself today.
Awesome.
I mean...
Thank you.
Today we honor a fallen friend and colleague by dedicating to her memory an important new addition to the Global Dynamics observatory.
Holly always loved observing the stars.
And now, to remember her that way,
I present to you the Dr. Holly Marten sodium beacon.
[Power up hum]
[Group murmuring]
What is that?
A mesospheric laser.
It creates an artificial star as a guide for stellar cartography.
[Applause] Oh...wonderful.
[Crowd murmuring]
So it's sort of a big laser pointer...thing.
May it also remind us that those we've lost are never truly gone.
Douglas, would you care to say something?
Uh...no.
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hmm.
Okay.
Holly loved music, so we'll conclude with what was apparently her favorite song.
♪ Ooh, car wash ♪
[Laughter]
♪ Working at the car wash, yeah ♪
Watch your back.
We have all Holly's favorites-- fusilli with gruyere, peanut puree and BlackBerry preserves on brioche.
Mac and cheese and PB and J.
Holly'd have loved it.
I just-- I can't believe she's gone.
Yeah.
It's been tough on all of us.
- Thanks, Vince.
- Yeah.
Nice service.
Thank you.
What's this?
Um...
Grace's Z-wave research.
She was on the verge of a breakthrough.
Nascent neural networking.
Wow.
I'll pretend like I understand what that means and say congratulations.
I just thought I'd pick up where she left off, but the test subject pool is very small.
It's only the 22 of you who were in the matrix that developed Z-waves.
Well, if you need help, I'll volunteer.
Are you sure?
The experiments are unorthodox.
Yeah, count me in.
Lab rat Carter at your service.
Thank you.
There you go.
I'm worried about Fargo.
What?
Why?
He's been missing meetings, and he's sleeping in his office.
Today at the ceremony it was like he had someplace more important to be.
I know the two of you have been up to something and--
It's nothing.
Look, he just lost Holly.
And everything today is a reminder of her.
I don't blame him for wanting to bail.
If I lost you, I'd...
You'd swear off other women for the rest of your days?
Totally.
Ms. Lupo.
Sorry to interrupt, but I can't seem to locate Dr. Fargo.
Oh, I will find him for you, sir.
Super.
We have a full agenda today.
With the Panop installation almost complete, we need to impound everything related to the Astraeus abduction, top priority's a photonic plasma computer.
Hold on.
The matrix computer?
Wait, you didn't say anything about me?
Well, what was I supposed to say?
"Hey, guys, nice memorial and all, but Holly's still kind of alive"?
You could have at least acted upset.
Well, plenty of people did.
The planetary sciences team would not stop bawling.
Cosmochemists are very sensitive, unlike certain people.
So what did you dedicate?
Ha.
Only an awesome sodium beacon for the observatory.
You named a laser pointer after me?
It's for astro-imaging.
It's lame.
Why didn't you ask me what I wanted?
But I didn't think you would care.
You're not even really gone.
You shut down the program with me inside?
- Are you crazy?
- Pull yourself together, man.
We have company.
Fargo, what are you doing here?
Uh, this lab is restricted, so thank you for unlocking it, Dr. Fargo.
You are welcome.
Major Shaw.
Pleasure to meet you, director.
You mind if we start with the main processor?
Yes, I mind.
What are you doing?
We're shipping this machine to Washington.
No, you're not.
You're not taking this computer.
This computer's a security liability.
As is everything your colleagues built during their abduction.
It has to be locked up.
For good.
Take anything you want except this.
This machine has done nothing but put you and your people at risk, Dr. Fargo.
Back off, jackboots.
If anyone's gonna take this machine apart, it's gonna be me.
Yeah.
W-what the frak, Zane?
Fargo, calm down.
I understand this is an emotional day for you, Dr. Fargo.
Why don't you just let us handle this?
I'm not going anywhere.
Jo, help me.
Um...
Excuse us.
Fargo.
Come on.
Let's go for a walk.
What is going on with you?
You can't let them take it, please.
Why not?
Because Holly's still in there.
I'm not crazy.
Just ask Zane.
Oh, is that what you've been working on together?
We were trying to get her out.
I just need to call the D.O.D.
Get her out of where, Fargo?
- Holly is gone.
- No, she isn't.
She exists in the photonic hard drive.
She's conscious.
I'm not gonna let them take her.
Okay, you had quite a jolt to your somatosensory pathways when Zane disconnected you.
We just need to check you out, and then we can call Washington together.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Um, call them about what?
About keeping that computer here until we can figure out what's going on.
Allison, I don't think that this is healthy.
Look at him.
Maybe packing that thing up will help him move on.
Or maybe he's right.
Maybe some part of Holly is still in there.
Yeah, but as what?
- A video game?
- No.
When I saw Jenna in the other Eureka, she was as real as you are.
Everything in there feels real.
Yeah, but now you know it wasn't.
Maybe not.
Listen, Jo, you weren't there.
You can't understand.
But he wants our help.
You still up for this?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Okay.
Grace documented the effect of zeta waves on the iFire nanobots.
I believe that, if we can learn to focus and control Z-waves, then we can unlock whole new frontiers-- telepathy, telekinesis...
Who knows?
And you can think I can do this?
We are about to find out.
Relax, focus, try to levitate the sphere.
- Lev--levitate?
- Try to levitate the spheres in these tubes.
Just concentrate.
All right.
I'm moving your balls with my mind.
There must be a better way to say that, but, yes, just don't get too excited.
[Laughs]
Oh!
I was still calibrating the sensors.
Now, that test responds to alpha waves, which we all have.
Being used right now for artificial limbs or computer interactive devices.
Oh.
This test...
Is the zeta waves.
Zeta waves.
Control your zeta waves, and you control the gun.
Gun?
Shouldn't I be on the other side?
Well, I think you'll focus better if you're on the business end of things.
Says the guy behind the protective shield.
Mm-hmm.
[Gunshot] Whoa!
[Gunshots continue] Okay!
Come on, Jack.
Make the paintballs miss!
Concentrate!
Your zeta waves are spiking.
Almost there.
You can do it.
[Yelling]
Pfft!
Pfft!
Dr. Deacon.
Sheriff Carter.
[Power down hum]
- Bad timing?
- Um, no.
We were just finishing up with something.
I have a list of items for my inventory
I was hoping you could track down.
Well, we'll get right on that.
Maybe I could find it with my mind.
- [Clears throat]
- How would you do that?
Just kidding.
Listen, we'll let you know as soon as we find your projects, major.
Super.
I'm very angry with you.
Zane?
You rebuilt a dangerous piece of technology so Fargo could have a cyber girlfriend?
No, we still don't know exactly what Holly is, and we didn't want to get anyone in trouble with the D.O.D.
While we tried to figure it out.
Okay, listen, if you and I are gonna work, you have to be honest with me.
Okay?
Not just when you feel like it.
All the time.
Honest.
Got you.
Now, honestly, babe, I'm a little busy here.
- Okay, Zane, I--
- I'm trying to save Holly.
Okay?
Sorry to interrupt.
Time to box that bad boy up, Mr. Donovan.
Yeah, it's all yours, G.I. Joe.
And those little frown lines you get between your eyes when you're mad, they're adorable.
Honest.
Later.
Are you on such friendly terms with all the scientists around here?
Oh, I'm barely on friendly terms with that one.
So how does this Panop system work exactly?
The nodes provide networked all-in-one security wired directly to G.D.'s main computer system and linked to the D.O.D. in Washington.
Cameras, sensors, data input and output.
They don't miss a trick.
I'm surprised that Fargo's okay with these.
In virtual Eureka, they had a lot of stuff like this, and it wasn't good.
Panop might have saved your friends from that whole experience.
Wouldn't the director do anything to prevent the loss of someone like Dr. Marten?
You have no idea.
What?
Is homeland security too busy groping people to make a phone call?
[Click]
Hello?
Hello?
Well, they were no help.
And now I'll probably get strip-searched on every flight
- for the rest of my life.
- No luck with DARPA either, but we still have other avenues to pursue.
Don't give up hope.
Thanks, Allison.
You're a good friend.
You really think Holly's in there?
I know she is.
Hey, Fargo...
Allison, will you tell the traitor that I don't want to talk to him.
Will you shut up and listen?
I only volunteered to break down that machine
- so I could get Holly out.
- What?
How?
I built a partition on the G.D. mainframe and transferred her character file into it.
Is that even possible?
I mean, she's not just a spreadsheet.
And thanks.
Yeah, well, I had to try.
[Beeping]
Damn it.
- The partition's empty.
- What?
Holly must still be on the photonic hard drive.
And now Shaw has it.
The next item on the D.O.D. impound list is a frictionless graphene servo.
Right.
Which is a servo...
Clearly something I've never seen before.
Hey, what happened earlier with Shaw?
Shaw is collecting special projects.
The Z-waves the 22 of you developed make you a special project.
And spending a day as a lab rat...
Yeah, is better than spending a lifetime as one, but, come on, I couldn't move squat.
It's not like I wave my hand and--and-- things happen.
Except that.
[Chuckles]
Are you seeing this?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Both:
Oh.
[Alarm whooping] Whoa!
- Henry...
- It's not responding.
Henry!
Whoa!
What was that?
[Alarm continues whooping]
Special project, huh?
I have no mechanical or mathematical reason for that malfunction.
It had to be you.
What, so I got superpowers...
[Softly] Now?
Not so loud.
We don't want to bring any premature attention to it.
So this is broken.
I'll go-- I'll go--
The poison gas...
Right, oh, and I'll run some tests.
[Whispering] Oh, and you might want to keep your hands in your pockets.
- Good safety tip.
- Yeah.
I feel safer.
That's good.
Last time we saw each other we had a fight.
Fargo, all couples argue.
Even virtual ones.
She's real.
I don't think I realized how real until now.
Maybe we should just tell Shaw about Holly.
They're gonna find out about her anyway when they examine the computer.
You know what they'll do if I tell them.
They'll study her.
They'll try to figure out what she is.
No, they'll dissect her.
If I don't tell them, maybe they'll think she's an NPC and leave her alone.
I mean, I could stand never seeing her again if I knew she was safe.
[Footsteps]
The D.O.D.'s got our machine in a secure loading bay in section four.
They're going to wipe the hard drive
- before they ship it out.
- They're gonna erase Holly?
We can't let that happen.
You know a way past the D.O.D. guards and our shiny new security system?
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but there may be a way.
You should see a junction a few meters ahead of you.
I'm nearing the junction.
The Panop system is ready to go online, sir.
Sorry.
Habit.
Now you have people calling you sir.
They wouldn't dare.
You know what I mean.
Leadership suits you, Jo.
I always thought it would.
You miss it?
Special forces?
Oh, this place is plenty special.
Long as it hasn't dulled your edge.
Like writing memos?
You and Dr. Fargo will be able to monitor all the nodes from here.
So will the D.O.D.
It still seems kind of big brother for G.D.
Did you hear about the dark matter pair annihilation that took out area 51?
- No.
- Exactly.
Didn't happen, thanks to Panop.
This isn't about spying.
It's about protecting people.
[Background chatter]
Wow.
That is impressive.
You can see, hear, and detect intrusions both physical and digital.
Was that supposed to happen?
No.
What's the problem?
I don't know.
What the hell is that?
Hit the reset switch.
I'm guessing that isn't supposed to happen either.
[Beeping]
- What happened?
- Wasn't me.
Something scrambled Panop.
Whatever it was saved me a nasty hack.
But the system will reset in a few minutes.
Fargo, Panop is down now, but we don't know for how long.
Zane will buy you as much time as he can.
Affirmative.
Frodo has reached Mordor.
Repeat--Frodo has reached Mordor.
Fargo, you have to hurry.
The access panel's stuck.
[Voice straining]
Almost got it.
How do you know about secret passageways around G.D. anyway?
You and Carter been playing security guard and sexy cat burglar?
My lips are sealed.
Oh, thank you.
Jo put the two of us on mutual full disclosure.
Mm.
How's that working for you?
Mm.
Some things people are better off not knowing.
[Fargo grunts] Got it.
Oof!
G-g-- [shouts]
I'm in.
[Groans softly]
Precious?
Where are you, my precious?
[Whispering voices] Fargo.
Over here.
Hello?
[Whispering continues] Is someone there?
Fargo, what's happening?
Hearing things, I guess.
[Overlapping whispering] Fargo.
It's kind of creepy in here.
Ee!
Oh...
Oh...
Uh...
Ah!
[Whimpering]
[Hyperventilating]
Now it's dark and creepy.
What are you talking about?
Get moving.
Oh.
Found it.
Okay, the drive has an onboard power cell.
Plug it in, and you're good to go.
Port six.
Green light means you've got her.
Gotcha.
Are you sure the flash drive will work?
I don't know.
We haven't fully decoded Holly's data structure.
I don't understand.
We've never had a system failure like this before.
There.
Back up.
[Alarm blares]
Isn't that...
Fargo.
Son of a...
Panop is back online.
Tick-tock, Frodo.
Nothing's happening.
I'm going in.
No, no, Fargo.
No, you don't have time.
Holly?
Holly?
Holly!
Dr. Fargo, what are you doing here?
You already wiped the machine.
I'm sorry, Dr. Fargo.
Ms. Lupo, would you please place him under arrest?
Jo.
You arrested Fargo?
I thought Allison was kidding.
Did she tell you what he's been doing?
Yes.
And I even understood some of it.
Look, we got to fix this.
Can you talk to Shaw, maybe get Zane to do, like, a computer autopsy or something?
Oh, not you too.
Jo, I live in a robot house with a robot deputy.
I think we should find out what this Holly thing is before we just dismiss it.
I'm gonna be a little busy figuring out how to keep Shaw from pursuing formal charges or getting us all fired,
- starting with Fargo.
- Come on.
- Fire?
- Come on nothing, okay.
He broke into an off-limits area and tampered with a brand-new security system in front of the D.O.D.
I didn't tamper.
And that weird whispering and those lights, it wasn't me either.
- What does he mean?
- Um, I don't know.
We've been getting strange incident reports all day.
Doors opening and closing on their own, machines malfunctioning, noises.
All over G.D.?
So not just where I am?
No, Carter, not just where you are.
Disappointing.
Um...
Okay, well, things started to go haywire right when Shaw installed those security things.
Maybe they're doing it.
Okay, I will look into it.
But he isn't going anywhere.
You want to help Fargo, finish Shaw's inventory.
Yeah.
Jo.
Listen, about Fargo--
- I told you that machine was bad for him.
And locking him up isn't?
Do you know how much trouble he's in?
How many protocols he's violated?
He believes that that computer is his chance to save Holly.
You helped him break in.
Allison, they recovered Holly's body.
She's gone.
And it's only hurting Fargo to act like she's not.
We both want what's best for Fargo.
Well, then maybe we should help him let her go.
[Grunts]
So how's Fargo?
He's all right.
I didn't realize the lengths he'd go to keep Holly around.
The computer preserved her identity and her consciousness complete with opinions, memories, emotions.
I mean, I understand wanting to protect that.
I mean, you hold on to what you can, Jack.
Like grace's research.
Yeah.
I mean, if we can establish some common ground, then we can start to build from there.
Collimating Q-switch.
Right.
Gesundheit.
Actually, speaking about your lab tests, turns out that things have been creepy all over G.D., so it's probably not me and my zeta-waves.
Although I am thinking it's the spyball things.
- The Panop nodes?
- Yeah.
[Electronic whine]
But, Jack...
Henry, I don't see any nodes.
They're, uh...
- There's not one in here.
- Uh-huh.
Oh!
Aah!
Go, go, go, go!
[Shouting]
- Aah!
- Aah!
Henry.
- I didn't touch anything.
- Oh.
These don't look random.
[Electronic whine]
Maybe we are being haunted.
You want to give me some space, chief?
With a record like yours,
I shouldn't even be letting you touch this machine.
- I was pardoned.
- You're a felon.
Well, guess we're not going out for beers.
Any sign of intrusion?
Besides him?
No.
But I did find this weird bitstream rattling around in the mainframe.
Where?
It's all over.
It's like a ghost.
It disappears from one subsystem and then it pops up in another.
That's the problem right there.
I'm deploying a level 6 antivirus to purge the G.D. system.
Whatever your ghost is,
Panop will kill it.
System purge will commence in 30 minutes.
Well, he's fun.
You helped Allison and Fargo break into the loading bay, didn't you?
If you want me to be honest, don't ask questions you don't want the answers to.
Fargo's so deep in denial it's contagious.
You know, maybe some sort of partial computer program, but Allison thinks it's an emotional projection, and Carter has no clue.
You can't possibly believe
- that that's really Holly.
- Jo.
It doesn't matter what any of us think.
- Just Fargo.
- Yeah, but I just want--
- I don't know why you're so hung up on defining what she is.
- Because I've been--
- Jo!
You might think you're helping Fargo, but you're not.
[Beeping]
What next?
Water-boarding?
Let's go talk to Shaw.
About...
I watched my dad struggle after my mom died.
You know, he held it together for my brothers and me, but...
Every night I watched him go through old photos and home movies, and he...
He just couldn't let her go.
I am sorry, Fargo.
I thought I was helping you.
I know.
I guess I didn't really make it that easy on you, did I?
But, hey, it's a-- it's a nice cell.
It's very tidy.
- [Chuckles] - ♪ Working at the car wash ♪
♪ ♪
What is that music?
I hate this song.
Who doesn't?
♪ Car wash ♪ [Computer keys clacking]
Wait.
What did you just say?
[Cell phone rings]
Lupo.
Yeah, he's right here.
We're on our way.
Jo, wait!
Is that possible?
I mean, all the weirdness.
The waving, the whispering-- that's someone trying to communicate with us?
Crudely at first, but yeah.
I think they got the hang of it.
Yeah, see, just as I thought.
A Z-wave signature, and not just anyone's.
We think we know what's going on.
Yeah.
Us too.
That's Holly's handwriting.
I told you, she's alive.
- So Zane's upload worked.
- It must have.
Holly didn't stay in the partition, because she's not a computer program.
She has a mind of her own.
She's alive.
System purge will commence in three minutes.
For three minutes anyway.
Panop system purge has commenced.
I can't stop the purge.
But I can track it from here as it moves through the Panop nodes.
When one of those turns red, that means the area's been purged.
If the purge catches Holly, she's gone for good.
Well, what can we do?
We find Holly.
If we can locate her signal,
Zane can hack an escape route for her.
The last sighting was in section three.
The isotope centrifuge went bananas.
Well, we just need to stay one step ahead of the purge and Shaw.
All right.
I'm on it.
I got to tell you,
I sort of like bad Allison.
- Let's go.
- All right.
I'll go look for signs of Holly.
Jo, we got to buy Holly some time.
[Rapid typing]
Jo, you mind telling me why you released Dr. Fargo?
You have to stop the purge.
It's affecting delicate systems.
A level 6 antivirus kills malware, nothing else.
I'm trying to protect G.D.
I am the head of security.
I know how to protect G.D. Now stop the purge.
Holly's signal is both neural and digital.
So she could survive in the G.D. system because it supports all kind of computing-- digital, optical, organic.
So, if we can download Holly before the purge wipes her out,
I think we can build a memory lattice to hold her.
If we can just find her.
Is that you, Holly?
That's my girl.
Nodes just went red.
Zane, Holly needs to get out of here now.
Allison, I'm hacking a path to send Holly your way.
Zane, now!
Sorry.
Holly's packing a lot of power.
Not every system can handle her.
Now, Zane.
That's it.
Just in time.
I've got her.
Holly's in the corrosive compounds lab.
- Is she safe?
- Go by the nodes.
The purge is coming.
It's too fast.
We can't stay ahead of it.
Henry needs more time to build a memory lattice.
Well, we need to find a place where there are no nodes.
Shaw put them everywhere.
They're all over G.D.
Not everywhere.
The observatory.
We'll get Holly to the observatory until you guys finish the lattice.
- Carter, power up the console.
- Got it!
Well, Jack, hurry.
[Background chatter]
Oh-oh.
Was that the sheriff?
Holly's almost there.
Holly's headed your way, Jack.
All right, still no nodes in the observatory.
Holly?
Holly?
She's here.
What's going on?
Look, I can't tell you, but a life is at stake.
Sir.
I'm sorry, Jo.
I gave you an order.
- So, unless you tell me--
- Now, that is one thing
I don't miss about Special Forces-- orders.
Now I'm gonna have to detain you.
I know the way.
Let's go, boys.
Jo must have stopped the purge.
It's safe for Holly to go back to the neural lab.
Henry and Fargo are waiting with the memory lattice.
That's great.
[Powering up sound, alarm] That's not.
Um...
Guys, something's happening.
[Rapid beeping]
It looks like she's trapped there.
We'll have to bring the lattice to you.
Done.
Go.
Come on, come on, come on.
World's slowest elevator, come on.
Wait, "Beam containment breach imminent."
That's not good.
Ah!
Wait!
"R-U--"
She's writing something.
What?
N.
"Run."
Guys...
Holly's signal must have damaged the control system before.
Jack, the laser's about to go critical.
If we don't stop it, that explosion will level the top three floors of G.D.
I vote we stop it.
What do I do?
Lots of buttons.
- Lots of buttons.
- Jack, don't touch anything.
The smallest increase in voltage could set off the breach.
Do you see the collimating Q-switch?
What does that look like?
I do know what that looks like.
But Shaw impounded it.
It's not here anymore.
What did it do?
The Q-switch would have let us shut down the laser.
Lattice in.
It should have blown by now.
Holly must be containing the breach.
Thank you, sweetie.
Uh...
She's not for long.
Holly, we're ready for you.
Get out of there now!
[Both shouting, whimpering]
[Groans]
Holly!
- So sorry, Fargo.
- Jack?
Jack, you guys okay?
W--we're okay.
But I don't think Holly is.
You want to know the truth?
Prison looks good on you.
And now my day is complete.
Also you look about a thousand times hotter with your hair down.
And I really don't like that chili you make, but I know it's your dad's recipe, so I just shut my mouth on that one.
Now is not the time, Zane.
All right, well, just one last piece of honesty.
You put your ass on the line for Fargo today.
For all of us...
Yeah, well, a lot of good that did me.
Yeah, well, this should help.
The D.O.D. was very distressed to learn that the Panop system malfunction sent our sodium laser into critical overload.
That's not quite what happened.
Really?
Then why do I have fully-documented forensics from the G.D. mainframe proving that?
Hmm.
Look, I agreed to be honest with you, not that D.O.D. asshat.
Speak of the devil.
The D.O.D. says to take your balls and go home, major.
So it says.
Yeah, and let Lupo out.
She received a commendation and a pay raise.
Paragraph five.
I got to see about Panop removal, but be right there.
Thanks.
I'll catch you later, Mr. Donovan.
I wouldn't count on it.
So what about Fargo?
I think he's a danger to himself and others.
But his quick thinking saved lives today, and my report will reflect that.
Thank you, major.
I am, however, taking the photonic plasma computer with me.
Sounds good.
I was wrong about your decision-making, Jo.
Your friends clearly have your trust.
I just hope they all deserve it.
You pay people to do that, you know.
You need anything?
Like beer...
Or a hug?
Yeah, I don't think anything's gonna help except time.
You know, we were so close.
I'm sorry, Fargo.
Holly stayed to buy us time.
She sacrificed herself for us.
For me.
If you need us...
We're here.
I hate seeing him like this.
Oh, it's gonna take time.
Allison, about what I said...
No.
You just wanted what was best for Fargo.
We both did.
- Ready?
I'm starving.
- Yeah.
By the way, Allison, you look smoking today.
Honest with me.
With...me.
Right.
Carter.
Hi, Zane.
- Hell of a day, huh?
- [Laughs] Yeah.
Zane lies to the D.O.D., Jo gets locked in her own cell, you are an accessory to breaking and entering.
Oh, that's nothing.
You went back in time to save me once.
I'd do it again.
I'm just sorry it didn't help Holly and Fargo.
Hey, Jack.
Just the man I was looking for.
Hey, sorry I couldn't be more help with your research.
I guess I don't have super powers.
Well, actually, I've learned quite a lot about Z-waves.
Oh, did it get you to common ground with grace?
Matter of fact, I had a very...
Interesting conversation with her.
Okay.
What's her perspective?
She reminded me that Descartes said,
"I think, therefore I am."
Holly is a unique being.
She thinks, she creates, remembers, and loves.
So there is something I'd like to try, and I'm going to need your help.
Okay.
You rebuilt the memory lattice?
Mm-hmm.
It wasn't easy, but for you...
Henry.
Henry.
- Boo!
- [Gasps]
- Hey!
- Did I scare you?
You--you're out.
- And you're...here.
- Yeah.
And I'm still a little mad at you.
If you'd asked me about the sodium beacon,
I could have told you that model is prone to terminal failover.
But I guess you figured that out yourself.
Be mad.
Just promise me don't ever leave again.
I don't plan to.
That is so romantic.
I'm very excited to have you here, Dr. Marten.
We're going to be best friends.
S.A.R.A.H., you mind?
We're kind of having a moment here.
[Whispers] Sorry.
Pretend I'm not here.
This is gonna be weird.
Honestly...
As long as I have you...
I don't care.
Previously on Eureka...
We think we may have uncovered possible espionage in Eureka.
Well, um... this doesn't look good, does it?
There was someone on that disc that you tried to destroy, and I can restore it.
- Don't do that.
- Who are you protecting?
You.
You introduced me to Beverly Barlowe.
You're all just staring.
We're just not used to seeing you alive!
I'm not used to being alive!
Is that supposed to happen?
What the hell is that?
I am telling you, sheriff, he has been acting very suspiciously.
Well, you guys have been neighbors a long time.
- 20 years!
- Yeah.
But there's always been something that I didn't quite trust about the guy.
Okay, well, thanks for telling me about it.
I'll talk to Dr. Adler.
Oh, here you go.
Thank you.
Talk about what?
He's out in his backyard in the middle of the night.
Like, for hours!
With all this weird equipment.
Of course he is.
Oh, so you're defending him?
Well, yes, it isn't suspicious behavior if you're an astronomer.
Ju... you know what?
I'm gonna check on it.
I promise.
Thank you so much, sheriff.
Good day, Dr. Blake.
I'll be keeping my eye on you.
What is that?
[Laughs]
Okay...
It's been like this all week.
Everyone thinks everyone else is hiding some huge secret.
Well, I understand how they feel after Grace.
Yeah...
Yeah, at least there haven't been any formal espionage charges laid.
Unfortunately, that's not gonna help Henry any.
No...
No, I do wish we could make it a little easier on him.
Aww.
I love you.
You know that, don't you?
Yeah.
- See ya.
- See ya.
Initial... and initial...
[Tablet beeping]
Signature... thumbprint...
[Tablet beeping]
- Uh, date of birth.
- Oh, which time?
No, you know, let's leave that one blank for now.
Uh, initial... signature...
Initial...
[Groans] How much paperwork does it take to bring someone back to life?
Well, we need to inform all relevant government agencies that a death certificate was filed erroneously.
- Which is a massive lie.
- Which is technically true, so, officially, Dr. Holly Marten never died.
Ah!
Hand cramp!
[Gasps] Oh, yay.
I have hands.
[Laughs]
I'm done.
What next?
No next.
Congratulations, you're alive!
Oh, seriously?
But, really, what next next?
Well, you live your life, Hol.
Not many people get a second chance.
You're right.
You're right!
I could do anything.
I mean, um, what kind of astrophysics should I focus on?
Or... or I could teach!
Uh, M. I.T...
Caltech...
[Gasps] Kindergarten.
I loved kindergarten.
I'm never gonna be able to decide what I want to do.
That decision is completely up to you.
I am the no-pressure boyfriend.
Well, you can use my lab if you want.
You know, for your research, thinking, whatever.
You know, when I was seven, I got a Barbie jumbo jet...
With the first-class accessory pack.
I thought that was the absolute best gift anyone could ever get ever.
I was wrong.
Doug, thank you.
Thank you!
Good morning.
Oh, hey, Jo!
Guess what, I'm legal.
Good to know.
Security reports for the director.
Hey.
- She was just saying thanks.
- I know.
And after what you did for her, you deserve it.
Good, I just wanted to be clear.
It might be impossible for you to believe, but I actually trust you.
Hmm.
[Phone rings] Oh.
Lupo.
Damn.
[Sighs]
I just want to know how they found out.
I'm required to file security updates every 72 hours.
- You couldn't fudge it?
- Look, I buried Grace's arrest as deeply as I could, but I'm not going to lie.
- My signature is on it.
- Right...
Stupid integrity.
Ms. Lupo.
You have a G.D. employee in custody under suspicion of espionage and passing of classified information.
Is that accurate?
Yes, sir.
Major.
We still don't know what happened, sir.
The Justice Department will be taking over that investigation immediately.
All evidence will be placed under seal and the prisoner will be in our custody.
You should have called me immediately, Jo.
Yes, sir.
We are handling it, sir.
Apologies, sheriff, but Dr. Monroe is one of your people.
Your instinct is to protect her, and we need to be ruthless.
If there's anyone else involved in this breach, we'll find them.
That was pleasant.
Yeah.
[Button clicks]
There are a number of projects that we should be talking about from our last communique, but I'd like to put those aside because the new project in section five is worthy of our attention.
I'll send a follow-up report.
Also, I have made preliminary contact with senator Michaela Wen.
She seems aligned with our goals and would be an enormous asset if we could recruit her.
I will continue to...
[Static]
All this to test some smart dust?
Well, it's one of G.D.'s most important geo-engineering projects.
What, smart dust, like, self-cleaning dust?
No, it's a way to reverse climate change.
- How does dust do that?
- Smart dust.
Well, global warming is caused when solar radiation is trapped in the atmosphere, so we're trying to reflect some of that heat using microscopic devices coated in barium titanite.
You know that shiny thing that you put in your windshield
- when you're parked in the sun?
- Yes.
Yeah, like a gazillion tiny versions of those.
- Oh, thank you.
- Mmm.
[Exhales]
So here's the containment unit for our small-scale test fog.
Wow...
T... uh...
Um...
I don't see anything.
[Laughs]
We have complete control.
We can change position, altitude, even the reflectivity.
Hmm.
What?
- Now that's cool.
- They're being contained by a cool plasma field.
Completely safe.
Wow.
So what happens next?
We're gonna spray them at 200 meters.
Are you using drones?
The director has decided to go another way.
- Hmm.
- Huh.

Whoo hoo!
- Is that...
- Fargo.
Yeah, this is gonna go well.

What happened?
Are you okay?
Sure, Zane.
I didn't see anything.

Come right to 1-4-7 and it's a go.
Roger that, base!
I'm in the pipe!

We gonna blow something up or get covered in goo?
Why are you so pessimistic?
Really?
Right...
I think I'm gonna go with goo.
I'll go with explosion.

Everything went perfect.
It worked!

Hello, Dr. Marten, what can I do for you?
Oh, Andy, awesome.
Thanks for coming down.
I am in need of a handsome and brawny test subject.
Well, you are a charmer.
Just right here is good.
Perfecto.
And may I say, it's wonderful to have you back.
Thank you.
It is good to be back.
I have lots and lots to do.
Wow, that appears to be some type of neural harmonic with a, uh...
You are so smart...
But a little too trusting.
Well, of course I believe in punctuality, but I think at the end of the day, there's...
Henry.
Good to see you up and about.
- Where's major Shaw?
- Uh, well, he's, uh...
He's putting together some files.
Yeah, which isn't necessarily a bad thing f-for Grace.
Yeah, no, he's, uh, he plays it hard but he's a stand-up guy, and he just wants to make sure that there aren't any more breaches.
Um...
I'm here to surrender myself to local law enforcement and G.D. security.
What are you talking about?
I'm the second spy.
I stole classified information,
I persuaded grace to do the same,
I recruited senator Wen, and all the damage that she caused...
The kidnapping, Holly's death... everything...
All on me.
Y... you're serious?
Henry, why?
You'll have to ask the other Henry from the other timeline to get the answer to that question.
This all happened before we altered things, before we took our little trip to 1947.
Right, okay, so...
So it wasn't you?
- Jack.
- But it was another you.
Not you you.
Right?
Back me up on this.
Jack, you can argue origin philosophy all you want, but it does not change the fact.
But in reality, you didn't do anything.
He's right.
Grace is sitting in a cell because Henry showed her the way.
If you're gonna punish her, then you have to punish me, and do not try to absolve me by using some technicality of quantum physics.
[Sighs]
Hmm.
This is hard, I know.
I'll find major Shaw.
Wha... no.
Wai... wait... wait!
Hen... right, wait!
You're doing this to be fair to Grace, right?
In part.
Then shouldn't you talk to her first?
Well, I could get you a couple minutes.
It doesn't change anything.
Thank you.

I got Henry and Grace a couple minutes.
Good, she'll talk some sense into him.
I can't imagine a world where Henry would do something like this.
The Henry we know isn't responsible, though.
Yeah, well, the law would say something different.

No, no, no, no!
[Brakes screech]
Smart dust?
Yeah, not so smart anymore.
- You're mistaken, sheriff.
- Oh, come on!
Strict safety protocols confined the smart dust to the test area.
Well, somehow it got unconfined because it was a Coney Island funhouse out there.
If the particles are untethered, the control unit will have to re-assimilate the cloud immediately.
Well, fire this bad boy up and sweep up the dust.
Where's the control unit?
I hate being right.
It's not fair!
It was going perfectly!
Well, it's all right.
I mean, random mirrors everywhere isn't the worst thing in the world.
- We'll deal.
- N... no!
Loose smart dust could potentially disrupt every band on the electromagnetic spectrum.
- Phones, computers...
- We'll deal.
The neural impulses in our brains.
Abstract thought, logic, the higher functions will go first, and then it'll hit the other stuff.

You know, speech, movement...
[Clears throat] Bladder control.
That other stuff.
Oh.
I have to take responsibility!

Not to the D.O.D., not to anyone.
I know.
And I want you to know that I am trying to do everything I can to help you.

Please, Jo, don't worry about me.
Just take care of Henry.

Hmm.
Took four departments three years to develop the smart dust control mechanism.
But I'm sure the director will crack it in no time.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, and in the meantime, you and I are going to see if we can track it down, so please, tell me it emits some sort of super energy lightning wave that we can track.
Sorry, boss.
No.
Right, then...
Then... then motive.
What does it do?
Who would want to steal it?
Mmm, I think you're on the wrong track there boss.
There are 72 geo-engineering projects competing with this one, and a solution to climate change would mean trillions of dollars in grants.
I smell sabotage.
I...
I don't know.
I mean, I know the people at G.D.
Can be petty and careless and... and negligent, true, and even homicidal, I've...
I've... what was I saying?
That no one at G.D. would have maliciously stolen the device.
It's possible.
How many competing projects were there?
72, including 208 scientists.
- 208?
- Yeah.
And I've already organized the most efficient route to visit them all.
[Sighs]
All right, let's start ringing some doorbells.
We gotta find this thing fast.
Great!
Let's go!
So what do you have?
Well, the smart dust is still localized near the original dispersal area.
We're looking at about 12 hours before we start seeing neural effects... if we're lucky.
That is why you came by, right?
Oh!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You know me, I love a dispersal simulation.
Um, oh, but there is one other thing.
Uh, I was wondering maybe...
If you have the time...
Maybe you could check on Holly.
I ran nutrient blood work yesterday.
How's she feeling?
Oh, she's fine.
Well, I mean, she says she's fine.
Fargo, she's good.
Oh, I... no, no, she's great.
I mean, her body is great.
Like, really great.
Like, va-voom.
She's been obsessed over the bio-printer lately and she wants to devote her entire life to studying it.
Well, it makes sense that she would be attached to that particular technology.
Yeah, well, I-I'm just concerned that maybe she's throwing herself into something too quickly.
Okay, I guess I could stop by and say hi.
Thank you.
Zane, I need you!
Right here in the hall?
Well, you naughty little minx, you.
Okay, not laughing.
Let's start that again.
What do you need me for, darling?
The D.O.D. is confiscating the evidence in the Grace investigation, and I need a list of everything they're taking.
Talk to Shaw.
He's your buddy.
It's a D.O.D. case now, and Shaw's by the book, and he's not gonna tell me anything.
Well, he ain't gonna tell me.
I sort of need you to acquire the list...
Discreetly.
The head of G.D. security wants me to hack classified D.O.D. files?
[Laughs] I didn't say that.
Please, do this for me.
Can you tell me why you need it?
Mmm, the less you know, the better.
You're protecting me?
- Same here.
- Hey, Zane.
Look, you're a straight arrow.
That's what I love and kinda hate about you.
I'm not gonna be the one that gets your hands dirty here.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Yeah.
Holly?
Hello?
[Bio-printer whirring]
What are you doing?
Beta sample:
Cellular lattice 47% printed.
47% of what?
[Bio-printer whirring]
Hi!
- What are you doing here?
- Just checking in.
Doug sent you.
It's sweet, but he worries too much.
[Keys tapping, console beeping]
- Well, he is the boss.
- [Laughs]
But just so I have something to report back, everything's good?
- Yeah!
Keeping busy.
- I can see that.
Oh!
That's not for me.
Uh, I mean, it's for me to study, not to live in.
I'm testing new molecular scaffolding
- for bio-printed organs.
- In there?
Seems smarter than running tests on myself.
I wouldn't want to melt my own head... again.
Holly, don't you think it's a little early in your research for you to be printing whole human bodies?
I mean, yesterday, you were a rocket scientist.
And the day before that, I was dead.
Why run simulations when I can test the real thing?
Holly, the somatic cell emulsions you're using are incredibly hard to produce, even here at G.D.
I guess you're right...
Except the boss, who also happens to be my boyfriend, said I could use whatever supplies I needed, so...
I'm actually kind of busy here.
So bye.
Oh, well, um...
I guess I'll leave you to it.
Fargo!
Any luck finding the stolen control unit?
Uh, no, nothing.
We've interviewed 108 people so far.
- 106, boss.
- 106 people.
And the fact that we haven't made any headway whatsoever doesn't have me down at all.
You, uh, didn't get my update, doctor?
What?
No.
[Console beeping]
The communications grid is bonkers.
Servers should be next.
Please tell me you have this thing fixed.
Uh... the smart dust should be re-coalescing at optimal altitude... now.
Fargo for the win!
Hmm...
Doesn't seem to be connecting with the smart dust there.
Well, there's some sort of crosstalk interference.
Only one other thing uses the same gaussian wave packets.
Ooh, let me guess.
Um, the missing control unit.
I had this happen!
I had this happen once with a garage door opener.
Well, wherever it is, it's still on.
But maybe I can install a booster to override the interference.
Well, the methane abatement team is waiting on us.
They're over in Dr. Glenn's cow pasture.
Oh, more suspects?
There's gotta be an easier way to find this thing than wading through cow methane.
I ran the numbers.
This approach still has the highest likelihood of success.
Any other method would be dangerously close to professional malpractice...
Boss.
[Clears throat]
- Let's go.
- Great!
What about that garage door thing?
I mean, there was a house on the street and they had theirs tuned to the same channel as ours.
I had to drive up and down the street with the clicker until their door opened.
Can we make one of those?
- A clicker?
- Sort of.
L-like something that can track down where interference is coming from?
[Laughs]
Well, it's a nifty idea, boss, but kind of impossible.
We'd have to rewrite the second law of thermodynamics, and if you wanted to use d'Alembert's formula to solve a one-dimensional wave equation...
Yeah, ye-ahhh.
All right, let's go.
So if you can set up somewhere near a vent, you can get started.
Hey.
Hey.
You're looking very tired, my friend.
Hmm, I'm sure.
[Laughs]
How you feeling?
I just keep thinking about Grace, and...
I don't know what to do.
I can't imagine my life without her.
Because you care about her.
We all do.
[Sighs] We are trying to track the dispersal patterns of the smart dust.
Ah, particle sensors.
We've been having power flickers.
Vincent's fusion generator is probably being affected.
- Henry...
- N-no, I'm happy to think about almost anything for a little while.
As a matter of fact, I was on my way to G.D. to see Holly.
She had some questions about the bio-printer.
She asked would I come by.
Uh...
I-if someone wanted to study molecular scaffolding, how would they go about it?
Oh, there's tons of research on the G.D. database.
I'd build a computer model from those specs.
Would you bio-print a body?
[Laughs]
No, that would be like, uh, launching a spaceship to test the zero-grav shower.
Yeah, well, that's what I thought.
What, are you talking about Holly?
Yes.
She was printing a body blank in the neural networking lab.
- Why?
- I don't know.
But when I pressed her about it, she basically kicked me out of the lab.
[Laughs] Okay, well...
I'll see what I can find out.
[Sighs]
[Door opens]
Major, I thought you weren't transferring the evidence
- till next week.
- No choice.
You've got an out-of-control dust cloud floating around.
Could damage the magnetic media even before it damages us.
Of course.
Can't be too careful.
But you, uh...
I want to be sure you don't leave anything important behind.
Have you ever known me to be less than thorough?
- Make sure those are sealed.
- Yes, sir.
I'd be happy to review the, uh, the evidence list.
Second pair of eyes never hurts.
I can also be very thorough.
I learned from the best.
You do know this is my investigation?
Of course.
I'm cooperating.
Thanks for the offer, but all the information connected to this case is classified.
Sir.
How many patients should we expect?
Uh, it could be hundreds.
Make sure we have extra neural exam kits and portable MRIs.
I need to talk to you.
It's important.
Okay.
While I was doing some research for Jo,
I found something.
[Keys tapping]
What is that?
Did the dust cause some kind of video malfunction?
That's what I thought at first, but here it is again, slowed by a factor of 40.
What the hell is that?
This message was buried in a doc-tram file on my lab computer.
It was addressed to Holly.
- Holly?
- Mm-hmm.
While she was in my lab, there was this slight irradiance surge.
She said she didn't see anything, but this would have hijacked every single video system.
She had to see it.
Why would she lie?
This is an excellent question.
One I didn't want to ask her straight out.
If her cortex is having memory problems, confronting contradictions in her perception could cause pathway damage.
Yep.
Her new brain is powered by a photonic processor.
Rhythmic flashes like this could act as a neural trigger.
Well, that's why I brought it to you.
The strobe patterns look like it could cause epileptic seizures.
Well, this can't be a computer malfunction.
The patterns are too complex.
This is not an accident.
Well, I'll keep digging then.
Maybe I can find a source code.
[Tool hissing]
[Sighs]
Hey, Fargo.
How's it going?
Ooh!
Oh, you smell... a lot!
Yes, methane abatement lab.
Smelly and a complete waste of time.
Thank you very much.
So, update.
The entire Eureka smart car system went down ten minutes ago, as did our digital links to the outside world.
Well, the good news is the cloud is stabilizing.
It's only affecting equipment so far.
Oh!
So a few more hours of bladder control.
I'll take it.
And the bad news?
I can't get my booster to work.
[Sighs] Smart dust.
It was supposed to be my legacy.
Now I'm just going to be known as director screw-up.
Yes, but, fantastically, they are calling it Farmageddon.
"Farmageddon"?
That is not fantastic.
This is a disaster!
Aw, come on, Fargo.
Get it together.
You're smart and sciencey.
Not like me, with my garage door opener idea.
Garage door?
Yeah, it... it...
The... the idea w-was that...
'Cause you know how your garage door clicker can, like, sometimes open someone else's garage door, so you could make a clicker that, um, could find the control unit.
That would totally track the interference.
Uh, no, actually.
Andy said that it would break, like, 100 laws of physics.
Yeah, well, Andy needs to do another self-diagnosis because this could totally work.
I mean, yeah, I could tweak a diagnostic array to capture the interference signatures and then, ooh, yes, then I could just run a spectral density search...
Clicker.
Who says you're not sciencey?
Almost everyone.
Henry.
Henry!
Oh, Allison!
I-I'm sorry.
Uh, so, I went to Holly's lab.
Everything's fine.
She's fine.
Nothing to worry about.
Okay, wait, wait.
Did you see how she was using the bio-printer?
Yes.
Does it concern you?
Just chalk it up to an overeager scientist excited to be back at work.
Besides, she's not gonna have very much access to it.
I had it moved off-site for "maintenance,"
so nothing to worry about.
Henry's working?
Um, yeah, he was just...
That was really... odd.
But I-I guess he just needs a distraction.
- Why?
What... what's up?
- Question.
Could the branium Titanic in the dust be affecting Andy before it affects us?
- The barium titanite?
- Yes, that's what I said.
'Cause Andy's acting weird.
Well, the dust could disrupt the E.M. signals in his processor, but it's too weak to be affecting the human synaptic cleft.
Okay, so it affects, uh, communications, computers, and Andy?
Yes, but that still doesn't explain why Henry isn't quite like Henry and why Holly...
Holly.
Why do you guys invent this stuff?
Jack, there's something strange going on...
[Phone rings] And it's not just about the smart dust.
Fargo's got a tracker for the control unit.
Let me find the control unit, then I can get the communications up and running, and then we can deal with that.
Okay, be careful.
I don't want your brain
- to get all scrambled too.
- Okay.
Okay, this is the thing.
See, I like how you see me.
I do.
And I like that you respect me, and not just "I'll respect you in the morning" type of respect, but real, actual respect...
Babe, I'm kind of in the middle of something.
But I am running out of time.
Shaw has taken the evidence to D.C.
Before the smart dust can corrupt the files.
Yeah, I heard.
Don't worry about it.
No, today.
Right now.
Jo, trust me.
Leave it alone.
I need your help, and I need you to trust that I'm doing the right thing.
- Please.
- You know what?
I'm betting the evidence has already been corrupted.
At least anything to do with Henry.
[Nervous laugh] Who said anything about Henry?
You think you're dating a moron.
[Computer beeping]
You said you wouldn't do it.
No, I said I wouldn't get your hands dirty, and I didn't.
Now stop asking questions and let me get back to work.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Zane.
- What?
I-I...
- I've seen that before.
- When?
When Holly was trapped in the G.D. computer, it...
[Phone rings]
Lupo.

Where are you?
- You are you okay?

Nope, it's just me.

Okay, this is so weird.
You mean all the mirrors?
Yeah, it's like Zane's dream come true.
So weird.
Carter!
[Choking]
[Carter's voice] Sorry, Jo.
Can't help you right now.
Got some things to take care of.
[Struggling]
Major, I don't know what else you want from me.
You wanted the evidence, we gave it to you.
And I just got a call from justice.
That evidence didn't exactly get there in one piece.
Well, you have to use a reputable moving company.
When I shipped my pinball machines out,
I got on yelp, I got recommendations.
63 digital files were corrupted.
My people say that data is unrecoverable.
Yeah, we did warn you that the smart dust might affect certain ferro-electric memory surfaces.
- Didn't we?
- Yes.
These files were targeted and erased intentionally.
I'm going to find out who did this, and I think I know where to start.
I expect full cooperation from your security staff.
Absolutely.
Jo thinks she saw something like this once before which was equally creep-tastic.
Well, what does that look like to you?
I'm gonna go with hands.
No, I mean does it look like someone is trying to get out.
Who would send this to Holly?
That's what I wanted to show you.
Check this out.
Those are all the root-level instructions?
Every line.
And see, there's no point of origin.
Nobody sent it.
- Well, what is this?
- I don't know.
It could be line noise or interference.
No, no.
It looks like...
E.E.G. tracings.
Those are Z-waves.
And if then Holly's pattern wasn't the only stuck in there.
Or maybe something else is trying to get out.
Something else from the matrix?
That ain't good.
Yeah, but if something else got out, we would know about it, right?
Smart dust.
What does this have to do with smart dust?
What if the smart dust isn't out of control?
What if someone else is controlling it, using it to knock out communication?
All right, but why?
So that we can't talk to each other.
So that we can't put the pieces together.
Come on, Carter.
[Harsh static] Ooh!
Zane Donovan.
Yeah, may I help you?
You're under arrest for obstruction of justice
- and destroying evidence.
- Excuse me?
Jo, take him into custody.
Jo, what are you doing?
- Take him to holding.

Good morning, Dr. Blake.
Is anyone else gonna come out of there?
It's a closet, not a clown car.
Okay, what were you guys doing in there?
They were both servicing me.
I'm sorry that I asked.
Well, with Holly's essence in S.A.R.A.H.'s computer,
I thought it might be nice to display her in a holographic form.
I mean, we're just working out the final details.
How do I look?
Um... exactly like you.
Oh.
I asked for bigger boobs.
You were perfect before your untimely interruption, and you are perfect now.
Aww.
- Air kiss.
- Both:
Mmm.
I can't actually touch anything...
Yes, Holly, I'm familiar with the concept of holograms.
Fargo, when was the last time that you slept or...
Bathed, or weren't here?
My love can neither sleep nor bathe nor leave.
So I shall do none of these until she can.
Oh, and don't worry, I have plenty of sick days accrued.
And I'm giving Dr. Fargo tips on dating a non-traditional entity.
Yes, because one of you dating my house wasn't non-traditional enough.
Hmm.
- Where is my phone?
- Hey, mom,
I told Dre we'd give him a ride to school today, so we have to go.
Okay, well, if I could find my phone or anything else around here.
Dungeon master, where were we?
S.A.R.A.H.:
Approaching a subterranean river in the caverns beneath the orc-infested keep.
Ooh, ooh!
I can use that 50-foot pole
I have stored in my portable hole.
Has anyone seen my phone?
I...
I think I found it.
- Where?
Oh.
- There it is.
[Electric zap] Ow!
It... shocked me.
Mine did too.
What's going on?
What?
What?
Happy Feynman Day.
Oh, great.
Feynman Day.
And a fine day for a Feynman Day it is.
You have no clue.
No.
Remind me.
Global's version of April fool's day.
Richard Feynman was a Nobel prize-winning physicist famous for his practical jokes.
So a bunch of science nerds playing pranks on each other.
Ah, what could go wrong?
Mm.
Yes.
I have to go inspect the medical equipment for the new marine lab before it opens tomorrow.
A day alone in an empty underwater lab is exactly what I need today.
You mean a day alone with your fiance
- is what you need now.
- Well...
It is not my fiance that I'm avoiding.
Hmm.
I think I'll avoid G.D. today myself.
Henry wants to talk about the bachelor party anyway.
Yeah?
Well, good luck.
On that note, um...
Any chance we could maybe, uh...
Nail down a date for the wedding?
Um, it's on my list of things to do.
Great, 'cause I spoke to Zoe, and she's really excited.
And if you look on the calendar, I've actually marked off...
I saw the calendar, and I will, uh, let my family know about the wedding as soon as I...
Can.
You haven't...
You haven't...
Told your family about the wedding?
Please don't get that look.
I...
look, I've just been really...
You know what, I don't want to get into it right now.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Um...
I gotta go.
Okay.
Uh, hey, boss.
If you're not busy, I'm gonna head out.
Actually, I think I might have an assignment for you.
You know how Fargo's been living on my couch and spending every second with his sort of dead girlfriend?
It's not healthy.
I don't imagine it's very good for your pre-marital bliss either.
No, there is that, um...
So I'm wondering, in your loveable and tactful way, if you could maybe...
Kick him to the curb?
Glad we understand each other.
Thank you.
Unh!
Invisible barrier, pre-approved.
[Humming]
Aah!
Magnetized pants, pre-approved.
[Loud bubbling] Stop!
Let me down!
Guys?
Guys!
Foam party in the detergent lab not approved!
Who is responsible for this?
Oh, I didn't do that.
I'm just here about my brachiopods.
I can't find them.
Dinosaurs.
Okay, tell me you're kidding.
No, uh, not brachiosauri.
Artemia salina, to be precise.
Very tiny, very harmless.
Just not where they should be.
Missing who-zits...
Not on my list.
[Loudly] People, what part of "pre-approved"
- do you not understand?
- Relax, Jo.
Try embracing spontaneity for once.
Oh, see, you say spontaneity, and I say reckless disregard for consequences.
I have 1,000 reconstituted lungfish in the estivation lab.
The thermodynamics wing is now a sauna.
Oh, and the cafeteria floor is a trampoline.
You're Kinda missing the point of Feynman Day, aren't you?
Oh, you mean there's a point to all of this idiocy?
Yes.
Some of the greatest innovations in history were the result of a really cool prank.
How do you think we discovered antimatter and velcro?
- Seriously?
- Well, no.
But it's possible, and you're kinda squelching that potential.
Damn straight!
Okay, the next one of you eggheads to pull an unapproved prank will be subjected to unapproved discipline.
Spread the word.
[Laughter]
What?
[Snickers]
Um, it looks like someone treated your clothes with nanofibers from the meta-materials lab.
Bring on the unapproved discipline.
Ow.
Get outta here!

Seriously, you drank the coffee I sent you?
You're a dumb-ass.

Just chill.
I just messed with the speech center of your parietal lobe a little bit.
You'll un-beaker in a day or two.
Well, three, tops.
"Congratulations, you've been promoted to head of section five..."
[Keys clicking]
"Dumb-ass."
Ah... this is your idea of payback.
Nice try.
You know what?
You're right.
You know, you wouldn't have the stones, so why don't you tell Lupo to leave the pranks to professionals, okay?
Nice touch, but I'm still not going anywhere near section five.

- I hate surprises.
How do you not know that about me?
Well, I didn't think it was a bad surprise.
Oh, my God, one moment alone.
Is that so much to ask for?
Come on down.
Just...
Think you're gonna like this one.
There you go.

Oh, my God.

I'm virtual Vincent, and I'll be your tour guide through each delectable course of my feast d'amour as well as through your undersea cruise through the enchanting Global Dynamics aquafarm.

Hey, check this out.
Whoa.
No, no!

[Unintelligible squeak]
You almost unleashed a flood.
Where is your P.A.?
I am ending this right now.
Listen up, Global.
Feynman Day is over.
Anyone perpetrating a prank, authorized or not, will be spending the night in lockup.
As grand Poo-Bah of section five,
I demand to be amused.
Let the section five pranks continue.
Mr. Donovan...
And by the way, you're looking smoking', Lupo.
What?
Really?
[Squeaks]
Whoa, Holly rolls a 20!
- Head shot.
Whoo-Whoo!
- Whoo!
Unh!
S.A.R.A.H.:
That eliminates the last of the orc combatants.
Do you wish to proceed deeper into the keep?
Hey, guys, here's a thought.
You know how college roommates have a sign to let the other one know they're getting busy inside?
[Clears throat] "A," my college experience did not involve a lot of "getting busy."
And, "B," does the compound word non sequitur mean anything to you?
I'm going somewhere with this.
Seeing as how we're both romantically involved with this house, to one degree or another, perhaps we should have a similar system.
Like today, for example.
We could pretend that I put out the sign, and you have to go.
[Scoffs] I'm not going anywhere.
But to be fair, you have been monopolizing all of her time, and...
You and S.A.R.A.H. have an eternity to spend together.
Holly and I might only have...
Wait, might only...
S.A.R.A.H.?
S.A.R.A.H., where did she go?
Is she okay?
S.A.R.A.H.:
I am unable to answer those questions with any degree of certainty.
As you know, Dr. Fargo, maintaining Holly's existence...
Just get her back as soon as you can... get her back!
Have what?
Um, only have until the end of this campaign until I have to go back to work.
Oh.
[Chuckles]
S.A.R.A.H., we're going deeper.
[Dice tumble]
- Nice.

If Zane wants discipline,
I will give him discipline.

This salad is really delicious.
Every ingredient in your kelp salad was organically grown right here in Eureka's own aquafarm, the largest manmade saltwater ocean habitat in the world.
Alli... how could you not tell your family?
[Sighs] Jack, please, can we just enjoy this meal?
Here's an interesting tidbit.
Lake Archimedes is home to over 10,000 forms of aquatic life.
When I'm excited about something in my life...
For instance, my wedding day...
I like to share it with my loved ones.
- And I'm going to tell them.
- Okay, when?
'Cause it feels like you're stalling.
Oh, this from the guy who took four years to ask me out?
I mean, what is the big rush?
Let's just take a breath.
- A breath for what?
- And remember, there's no need for you lovebirds to be shy around virtual Vincent.
What happens in the mobile obser...
Lights.
Um...
[Chuckles]
Maybe we should just do this another time.
Maybe we should.
What do you mean?
Well, what to you mean?
I meant lunch.
Right, that's what I meant too.
Lunch.
All right.
[Trills]
Henry told me how to take it out of autopilot.
I've just gotta remember the sequence.
[Sighs]
- Jack.
- Hold on, I...
I did it with a song.
It was...
Um...
[Hums] Seven...
[Humming] Jack...
- Four...
- Jack!
What... yeah...
[Bubbling]
That doesn't look like it's on the programmed tour.
Okay, number sequence.
Right, it's... it's, uh...
[Hums]
Seven.
The... the...
[Hums]
- Four... uh... the...
- Go on!
Yes!
Watch it!
[Alarm whooping]
[System Powers down]
Uh... gotta say I was expecting something a little worse.
Auxiliary power activated.
Okay, well, whatever it was, it fried the power.
Propulsion, navigation, communication... they're all down.
All right.
Now what?
We drift down to the bottom of the lake, and we brace for touchdown.
Brace, brace, brace.
Again, not so bad.
Wow.
[Loud creaking]
- [Gasps] Oh!
Oh!
- Ohh!
Yeah!
That's bad!
[Creaking stops]
[Grunts] Don't move.
Okay.
[Loud banging]
What the hell are those?
- Automatic safety shields.
- Okay.
Jack, we are not on stable ground.
If we go over the edge, this lab was not built to take that kind of fall.
Okay, can, uh...
Can we drop anchor?
Secure to the lake bed?
- It's okay.
- We don't have an anchor.
All right, can we, uh...
Maybe fire torpedoes?
Jack, this is a marine lab, not the Red October.
Um, how 'bout fire a...
Like a...
like...
Like a grappling hook thing...
- Seriously?
- Well, at least I'm trying!
Wait a minute, the lab does have a couple sample probes.
If I could bypass the electronic trigger,
I could...
I could manually launch all the probes towards the trench at once, and maybe the reaction will push us backwards onto stable ground.
Yeah, that's different from firing torpedoes.
And now an explosion in the alkali metals lab?
Seriously, if undermining my authority wasn't enough, someone could have really been hurt.
Oh, Jo, come on.
I didn't blow this place up.
Oh, are you going to deny these assorted acts of "spontaneity" too?
All right, well, that one was me, but you've gotta admit it was kind of funny.
Okay, Zane...
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Um, there is a common denominator to a bunch of these, but it's not me, it's water.
They're all water-based.
Look at this.
Steam in thermodynamics, reconstituted lungfish.
Fishbowling Fargo's office, the avalanche of lather.
Yeah, and alkali metals, which don't exactly play well together.
Watch.
The reaction's so violent that it ignites the liberated hydrogen gas.
Um... all right.
Uh, rubidium... water...
You might want to stand back a little bit.
Okay.
You ready?
[Small explosion]
- Uhh!
- Whoa!
Multiply that by a couple thousand grams...
And you get fireworks.
Yeah.
Not exactly the spirit of Feynman Day.
- Maybe this wasn't a prank.
- What do you mean?
Shh.
[Water dripping rapidly]
- Do you hear that?
- What?
I think it's...
Behind here.
[Grunting]
[Zap] Ooh!
- A broken down sprinkler?
- No.
The lab uses a halon fire suppression system.
So where's the water coming from?
Hey, Henry, I was just headed your way.
Okay, so G.D.'s water systems are in the clear.
No leaky pipes, no overflows.
Nada.
Where's this water coming from?
Lake Archimedes.
Okay.
Wasn't expecting that.
Yeah, you and me both.
I analyzed the water from the pranks, and the high content of artemia salina was the same in each.
It's from our lake, no question.
Uh, who... back it up.
Arti who?
Artemia salina.
Tiny brachiopods?
Fowler.
Whatever it is you're doing, does it have to be done on the tippy side of the boat?
Do you really think I arbitrarily just picked a spot to bypass the electrical system?
If my weight hasn't put us over the brink.
I don't think a few more minutes is likely to make a difference.
"Likely" is the word I'd like to focus on.
Well, I am going to focus on my plan to move us back from the edge of oblivion.
Your plan...
Which is based on my plan.
Yes, Jack, you are the genius.
[Lab creaking]
Wait, that's it, isn't it?
That's what?
Why you haven't told your family.
I don't measure up against the geniuses you brought home.
Come on, you have to know, after all these years, the differences in our I.Q. don't mean anything to me.
Aha!
So you admit there's a difference!
Of course there's a difference.
What are the odds that we would be exactly the same?
Well, I don't know.
I'm not bright enough to figure it out!
You know what, Jack, this is your issue, not mine.
What do you think, I go around comparing your I.Q.
with my previous husbands'?
I do now.
You know what?
Me and my genius I.Q.
are gonna go back to saving our lives.
[Loud creak]
Oh!
Oh!
[Gasps]
Whoa...
Aaaah!
[Shrieks]
[Clinking and creaking]
At least we survived the descent.
Yeah.
[Sighs]
So we're good?
Yeah, we're great.
That's not what I...
[Sighs]
Never mind.
[Grunts]
You know, when we don't get back on time,
Jo will know what to do.
She's built for this sort of rescue.
Great.
Maybe she'll wear her sexy cat suit for the occasion.
I saw you two in the corner at G.D. this morning whispering together.
We were whispering about this.
She's the one who helped me pull it off.
Well, look how great it's turned out.
You're...
You're still hung up on her?
That was a fake relationship between a fake her and a fake me in a fake computer world!
A fake computer world designed to follow a plausible course of events!
If you think that I spend my day comparing computer-world Jo to you, that's your issue, not mine.
[Sighs]
Jack, what are we doing?
Is that a trick question?
Because I'm not very bright, so...
We never used to be like this.
I mean, our life is becoming nuts.
I hadn't noticed.
I guess it's always nuts.
But we have always been able to get through anything together.
Jack, I'm not worried about Jo, or even the differences between us.
I'm worried about losing what we have.
And you really think that's gonna happen?
I think that it's already happening.
We've gotten so caught up in the romance of things, we haven't stopped to think about reality.
The merging of our households, our family.
The chaos of it all.
Jack, our kids will become our kids.
What if things don't work out?
I never thought about it not working out.
Yeah, well, there's a lot at stake here.
I mean, it's...
It's something that we have to consider.
What you and I have built together is sacred to me.
And if we do this...
And it doesn't work out...
We will never be able to go back to the way things were.
Before.
At this moment, you'll get a remarkable view of the famous Archimedes trench.
But you wouldn't want to take the plunge into that abyss.
That thing...
Is crazy deep!
Fowler, I found your missing brachiopods.
Yeah, along with a cubic ton of lake water that you neglected to mention.
Well, the water's not important.
Well, Dr. Fargo might feel differently when he's swimming to his desk.
Do you know how many labs, how many projects you've destroyed today?
I was trying to fine-tune my targeting system before the marine lab opens tomorrow.
Look, it seems that particle entanglement is more, or perhaps less entangled than I originally anticipated.
And Dr. Fargo's recent redaction of my recent redaction is contingent upon proof that my matter relocator has practical applications, hence the brachiopods.
Okay, less "why," more "how."
Okay, I have been attempting to transfer a sample of artemia salina from lake Archimedes all day.
Now, my readouts show that it's been both taken and deposited, but...
- But you flooded G.D. instead.
- [Sighs]
You know, I bet someone's Feynman Day antics are responsible for scrambling my directional signal, not to mention my job security.
Okay, listen, I'm gonna deal with the pranksters, but in the meantime, I want this machine kept off.
[Indistinct P.A. announcement]
[Sighs]
[Beep]
[Typing rapidly]
- Hey...
- Someone left the faucet on?
No, someone left Feynman Day on.
Would you please go and shut down any section five pranks still in play?
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but those guys aren't gonna listen to me.
Whether you believe it or not, you're head of section five.
So just stop acting like a 12-year-old and man up.
Okay.
- But if this is a prank...
- Zane...
I'm not interested in stooping to your level.
Oh,my level.
Real...
ly?
Does that look like a chunk of the new submersible to you?
To me it looks like a key section of the digital integrated circuitry that powers every operating system on board.
Worse than chunk.
Yeah, a little bit.
The mobile lab's not too mobile anymore.
Um, how'd that get here?
Fowler relocated it.
Henry, please answer.
And the paladin rolls another 20!
It's not very fair, your being able to control your roll so precisely and all.
Yeah, but he's on our team, so sha-bam!
Head shot!
Ha!
[Cell phone playing tune] Hold on.
I'm taking a sick day, Jo.
This better be important.
Fargo, we have an emergency search and rescue.
We need you at G.D.
Uh, when you say emergency, is that with a little "E"?
- Doug, go.
- Yeah, but we're...
It's not like I won't be here when you get back.
Don't worry, Dr. Fargo,
I'll watch after your girl for you.
I'll call you if anything happens.
Okay.
[Sighs]
My turn?
- Tell me you found them.
- Yeah, we're working on it.
Jack and Allison did not take the programmed route.
Well, what about communications?
No go.
We've got rescue divers combing the water.
They're doing high and low-resolution sonar sweeps of the lake.
[Computer blips and bleeps]
Sweeps complete.
No hits.
How's that possible?
Okay, they're down there somewhere... we missed them.
- Impossible, unless...
- The Archimedes trench.
It's more than a mile deep, and that lab will not survive the pressure for very long.
How do we get to them?
We can borrow a submersible from the nearest naval base, but that'll take hours to prep and transport.
- How much oxygen do they have?
- Nine hours, maybe more.
If that capsule's still intact, we'll get 'em back.
I trust you're both enjoying the "lobster du love.."
This succulent invertebrate is one of lake Archimedes' most voracious bottom feeders and is a denizen of the aquafarms
- you're now passing on the right.
- Really?
One thing works down here, and it's gotta be him.
Every seafood lover has had a bite of one of these succulent creatures.
Any seafood lover wouldn't have it any other way.
- You...
- Enjoy...
Can you please stop banging?
It's clearly not working.
Clearly.
[Sighs] Okay, listen.
I'm sure everyone's working hard to find us, so while we wait, can we please not fight?
Or bang things.
Okay.
Who's in the mood for something sweet?
Oh.
Oh!
[Distant knocking]
- Oh.
- Ah!
[Loud creaking]
[Clang clang] Oh, the pressure!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Ah!
Oh!
Oh, my God.
[Creaking]
[Water splashing]
Come on!
What's the point of an airlock if it's not airtight?
Can we seal this?
Jack, I don't think we can stop this lab from filling with water.
Don't mean to be a buttinski, but might I suggest a dessert wine?
Sure!
What goes good with a watery grave?
Um, I'd have to check the Cafe Diem database and get back to you in a jiff.
- Jack, wait!
- Ohh!
If he can connect to an outside database, then he has or had a super wi-fi connection.
I realized it just as it left my hand.
Okay, we might have lucked out.
If I can get this thing working again...
Okay...
MayDay!
MayDay!
- Vincent, what are you...
- Hello?
Anyone there?
Can you hear me?
Okay, we need help.
We just got vortexted...
Or something.
Oh, my God, it's Jack!
They're using virtual Vincent's super wi-fi connection to communicate.
We need to open up a two-way signal and lose the visual.
[Indistinct chatter]
Then we fell into a trench, and now we're in the airlock, which, by the way, is not as safe as it sounds!
- All right, Jack, it's Henry.
- Henry!
We have a submersible on the way.
It'll take a few hours, but even in the airlock, you shouldn't be in any danger of losing oxygen.
We're gonna drown before we run out of oxygen.
Henry, we're gonna be underwater in less than ten minutes.
There's gotta be another way to get down there.
Fowler.
Hey, turn that thing back on.
- What?
- Now!
Okay, he can relocate them.
He brought up a piece of the lab earlier.
It doesn't work.
Zane, you shut down all the pranks, right?
Yeah.
Although none of them utilize an energy spectrum that would have messed with Fowler's system.
That's because it wasn't a prank.
What?
I did some tinkering since we last spoke, and it turns out my targeting system is faulty.
Even if we had their precise location,
I couldn't pinpoint them.
Well, Zane, you've been targeting me all day.
How?
I programmed this baby to lock onto your DNA, making you the bulls-eye for an infrasonic meta-material changing frequency.
That's...
That's kinda brilliant.
Yeah, I can pleather her at will.
No, for saving Carter and Allison.
We have their DNA on file.
If we can program Zane's DNA target system into Fowler's matter relocator, then maybe we've got a shot.
Jack, it's a long shot, but we're gonna use Fowler's device to relocate you and Allison back to G.D.
I know it sounds risky, but it's all we've got.
Allison, we're trusting our lives to this thingy that relocated a slab of beef into Oblivion?
What if it mixes our DNA with, like, fish, and then we end up like mer-people?
I mean, do they even think about stuff like that?
Jack!
We have to stop worrying about what might happen and start focusing on what we can do right now.
All right, good idea.
Yeah.
So what do you want to do?
Okay...
[Lab creaking]
- Okay, okay...
- Okay...
Okay, listen.
The pressure is crushing the lab like a tin can.
- Right.
- Okay...
If we can manually disengage while there's still enough air in here...
Right, oh!
Then we can float.
Well, we can hope for neutral buoyancy at best, but we should be able to get enough separation to stop the lab's collapse from sucking us in.
Okay.
Okay.
How do we do it?
Okay, there are four emergency release levers under us.
You have to pull them all to disengage.
Okay, I got it.
I'm on it.
Okay?
[Creak]
Jack?
[Creaking]
Jack?
!
I got it.
[Panting]
[Inhales deeply]
[Clang]
Okay...
[Clanking]
[Creaking]
It won't budge.
I think it got damaged during the fall.
Okay, then...
- Did you get it?
- DNA on demand.
- Where do you want it?
- Right here.
[Sighs]
[Lab creaking, metal crunching]
[Breathing rapidly]
[Deep breath]
[Gasping]
[Both sputtering]
Oh, God!
[Laughing, crying]
The matter relocator will be operative in a few minutes, so just sit tight.
All right.
So we wait.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- There's just one more thing.
- What?
- I've settled on a date.
- What?
Marry me, Jack.
Right now.
Are you sure?
I mean, I pictured something a little different.
And, of course, once we do this, we can't go back.
I don't want to go back.
Okay.
Henry, uh...
You ready for some on-the-fly officiating?
Uh...
I don't know.
I was kind of looking forward to being best man.
Yeah, great.
You can be both.
Well, Allison's gonna need a maid of honor.
I'm talking to her now.
All right, then.
Um, dearly beloved...
[Electricity crackles]
We are gathered here today...
Uh, Henry, how about the cliffsnotes version?
Right.
Do you, Jack Carter, take Allison Blake to be your lawfully wedded wife, for richer or for poorer, for as long as you both shall live?
- I do.
- And do you, Allison Blake, take Jack Carter to be your lawfully wedded husband so long as you both shall live?
I do.
Then, if there are no objections...
Oh, hold on.
- What?
- Just...
I mean, you're not...
We're not just doing this because...
I mean, we're...
We're really doing this, right?
I love you, Jack.
Good answer.
Bring us home, Henry!
Then I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Jack, Allison, can you hear me?
Jack?
Jack, Allison, can you hear me?
I have a lock on their DNA signatures.
Hit it.
Hit it!
[Power surge] Okay.
[Both gasp]
May I present doctor and mister Jack Carter!
[Cheers and applause]
Jack, we're married.
How's it feel?
Wet.
[Laughs]
[Cheers and applause]
Okay.
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
By the way, you owe me a buck.
What?
Hey...
You bet against the wedding?
Ii didn't think you'd actually go through with it.
Well, you proved me wrong, so congrats, Carter.
Well, thank you.
We're still going through with that bachelor party,
- though, right?
- Well, I think it-it...
It's something we can discuss.
Wow, you guys, that was so exciting.
Um, Fowler, you're fired.
I kinda figured.
[Indistinct chatter]
Hey.
So thanks for helping Jack with my surprise today...
And for being my maid of honor.
Well, I...
I was the only girl here, so...
No.
You really are my maid of honor.
You can cry now.
Thank you.
[Chuckles]
Chicks.
Whatcha gonna do?
[Chuckles] Okay.
Hey, um...
Don't waste a second with her.
Not one.
Congratulations, Carter.
Thanks, Fargo.
- Jack, go be with your wife.
- Right.
So what's the deal with me running section five?
It was my idea.
You like?
I...
I... yeah.
But why?
Because you deserve it.
No, no, I-I don't.
Everyone knows I'm a maturity-challenged screw-up with little to no capacity for leadership.
That's what everyone knew about me too.
It took a time-line shift to throw me into the deep end, but I swam.
So will you.
Oh, I'm thinking something small.
Your family and my family...
Oh, yeah, I don't know.
Hey...
You want to talk about it?
Nah, I'm...
It's about Holly.
Hey... you're here bright and early.
Gotta make a good impression on my subordinates.
[Chuckles]
Look, Zane, I may have been a little too uptight about Feynman Day.
I was wrong.
That's okay.
I would apologize for your wardrobe malfunction, except your butt just looked so damn good in that outfit.
But I get it.
It's your job to make sure everyone's safe.
And you take it seriously.
I can respect that.
Wow.
I lobbed you a softball, and you took the high road.
Fargo picked the right man for the job.
[Laughs]
Uh, yeah.
Well, I hope you're right.
Because I just gave myself an assignment that I can't screw up.
Fargo gave me his trust, and I'm gonna give him something back.
What's that?
Holly.
She's dying again.
We were hoping S.A.R.A.H.'s processors
- could handle her, but...
- Is there a computer that can?
No.
Whatever Holly is now, she's more than just information as we know it.
Sustaining her is gonna take a breakthrough
- in computer programming that...
- That only you can do.
Exactly.
[Scanner whirs]
Identity confirmed.
Welcome, Mr. Donovan.
Hmm.
I'm sure your butt looks pretty good too.
[Indistinct P.A. announcement]
[Blipping and bleeping]
- [Chuckles]
- Morning, boss.
Mrs. Boss.
Don't worry, I'm not staying...
I just thought you might want somebody to drop off the kids today.
- Oh...
- Oh.
Andy, that's very thoughtful of you.
And I'm gonna take Jenna to the new animation exhibit after school.
You know, to give you guys
- a few more hours of alone time.
- Thanks.
Yeah, I'm gonna get out of your hair too.
You guys have been more than patient, and I can't keep ignoring my responsibilities.
I am thinking of keeping the beard, though.
I'm not sure that's a good idea, necessarily.
Oh, and I can't technically leave, heh, but I can go into sleep mode to give you privacy as long as you want.
You just...
Okay... stop.
Um...
Nobody's going anywhere.
Fargo, in light of Holly,
I think maybe your responsibilities can wait.
And, Andy...
Why don't you take a sick day?
[Chuckles] Kevin, Jenna, you're playing hooky today.
So you guys really want to deal with total chaos on your first full day as husband and wife?
You bet we do.
Our life is total chaos, and we wouldn't want it any other way.
So... come on.
What's this game we're playing?
S.A.R.A.H.:
A fantasy role-playing game.
We can always add a few more party members to the quest.
All right.
Can I be sheriff?
[Laughter]
Might he be under a fighter class?
Oh, I would say paladin, because he's a good fighter, right?
That's it.
[Laughter]

At home?
At home.
Probably, some forty year old spinster?
Not at all.
I mean, as soon as you marry, every day you will remember me with praise and gratitude.
You're lying, Fekla Ivanovna!
Oh, I'm too old to lie, sir;
A dog lies.
And the dowry:
a stone house in Moscow, so profitable, it's a real pleasure.
One merchant pays 700 rubles for a stall.
The beer cellar also brings in quite a crowd.
And how is she, how does she look?
Like a lady!
White, rosy, like milk and blood, so sweet, that I can't even describe her.
Nonetheless, she's not the daughter of a head officer?
The daughter of a merchant of the third rank!
And she is one who would not bring shame even to a general.
And she is one who would not bring shame even to a general.
I was asking you about that, because I am a court counselor - so I need, you understand...
Yes of course, how can one not understand!
We had a court counselor too, but he was refused: they didn't like him.
Well, and aside from this one, are there any other ones?
What other one do you want?
This is the cream of the crop!
The very cream?
You can search the whole earth and not find another like her!
We'll think about it, we'll think about it.
Come back the day after tomorrow.
Have mercy, sir!
I've come to you for three months straight, and there's no use!
He just sits there in his pajamas and smokes his pipe!
And you think that marriage - is just like:
"Hey, Stepan, hand me my boots!"
Put them on your feet and off you go?
Here one needs to... carefully consider.
Look into it.
It's the worse for you!
There's already a gray hair on your head!
Soon you won't be good at all in a husband's role!
Why are you talking such garbage?
!
- Where do you see a gray hair?
Where do you see it?
!
- You look!
This one doesn't suit him, that one doesn't suit him!
- I have such a great captain in mind,
- Gray hair!
that you wouldn't rise above his feet!
How are you here?
Listen, why the hell did you marry me off?
What's wrong with it?
The law saw that it was done.
The law saw.
As if!
A wife!
As if I couldn't live without one?
You were asking for it yourself!
Old rat!
Gray hair.
That's worse than the plague.
You're crazy!
Why?
!
Why?
!
What is this foolishness!
You scared me!
Seriously!
My soul leapt out of my body.
My, what a scoundrel!
And you didn't even tell me anything about it!
What a person!
I ask you kindly: doing it in secret, huh?
What are these jokes?
!
And you broke the mirror!
This wasn't free you know:
bought in an English store!
Well, enough of that!
It's me who should be angry at you.
You hide everything from me, your friend.
You're thinking about marriage?
What foolishness, I...
I wasn't thinking about it at all!
But the evidence is right there!
It's well-known, what sort of bird she is!
Hey, Fekla!
Well, Fekla, what is your patronymic?
Speak.
Who is she, what, and so on.
A noble?
An official?
And he broke... the mirror.
Enough, I'll find you a new mirror.
Yeah, you'll find one!
I know those other mirrors!
They make you look 10 years older, and your mug looks crooked!
Or in the merchant class?
And what is her name?
Agafya Tihonova.
Agafya Tihonova!
Agafya Tihovna!
Brandahlystova?
Oh no
- Kuperdyagina.
Kuperdyagina?
What, does she live in Shestilavochnoy?
Not at all.
It's closer to the Sands, in the Soap Alley.
Well right, in the Soap Alley, right past the stall - a wooden house?
Notpastthestall, by the beer cellar.
How's that, past the beer cellar?
I don't know anything about that.
But when you turn into the alley, you'll see a booth.
And as soon as you pass it, turn left.
And there right in front of your eyes - I mean right there in front of you there will be a wooden house where the seamstress lives, who lived with the high secretary from the senate.
But don't enter the seamstress' house.
Right after it there will be a second house, made of stone.
That's her house.
That is, the one she lives in, Agafya Tihonova, the bride-to-be.
That is, the one she lives in, Agafya Tihonova, the bride-to-be.
Good.
Good!
Now I'll do everything;
and you go away, - there's no need of you any more.
How's that?
Do you really mean to arrange a marriage yourself?
Myself, myself;
you just don't get in the way.
How shameless!
- That's not a man's job.
- Go away.
Come to your senses, sir, really!
Go on, go on.
You don't understand anything!
Don't get in the way!
You just want to rob people of their daily bread!
You're godless!
Know your place, grasshopper - get out of here!
What crap you've muddled yourself with!
Well, brother!
This business can't be dragged out.
Let's go!
But I was just... you know...
It's ok, it's ok.
There's nothing scary here;
it's Christian business, it's even necessary... for the Motherland.
- I was just thinking...
- It's fine, it's fine!
Just don't get flustered:
I'll marry you so well, you won't even feel it.
We're going right away... to see the bride.
What's this now!
Going right away!
Well, what's the use in delaying this business?
Judge for yourself:
what do you gain by being a bachelor?
Just look at your room.
What's in it?
There's an uncleaned boot, there's a wash cloth,
there's a big pile of tobacco right on the table.
Well, that's true.
I know full well that there's not much order here.
Well, and as soon as you have a wife, you won't recognize yourself or anything else.
Here you'll have a couch, a doggy, some little one in a cage, handcrafts.
And imagine, you're sitting on the couch, and suddenly a cute lady sits down next to you, so pretty, and pats you with her hand.
Oh, damn it, once I think about, of course... what beautiful hands there are.
What's that!
As if they only have hands!
..
Brother, they have... well, let's leave it at that!
God only knows what they don't have.
Well to tell you the truth,
I like it when someone pretty sits next to me and...
There, you see, you're getting it.
Well, now we just need to give the orders.
The wedding dinner and so on - I'll take care of all that...
You definitely can't have less than a dozen bottles of champagne, no matter what you want.
It's also definitely good to have half a dozen bottles of Madeira.
And Rheinwein - screw it, right?
What concerns the dinner -
I have in mind a server who works for the court:
that devil will feed you so well, you won't be able to stand up.
Wait a second, you're getting so into it, as if the wedding is already here.
And why not?
Why delay?
Aren't you agreed?
Me?
Well no, I'm not completely in agreement yet.
There you have it!
You just told me that you wanted it!
I was just saying it wouldn't be a bad thing.
Mercy, how's that!
We were about to finish this whole business!
..
What, you don't like married life or something?
No...
- I like it.
- Then what is it?
What's stopping us?
Nothing is stopping us,
- it's just weird...
- What's weird?
!
How is it not weird?
!
How is it not weird?
!
I was unmarried for a long time, and now all of a sudden... suddenly - married!
Well?
Well?
!
Well, aren't you ashamed of yourself?
I see one needs to talk sternly with you:
I will speak with you plainly, like a father to his son.
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself closely!
Just like you're looking at me now!
Well, what are you now?
Just a log!
You don't have any meaning!
What are you living for?
Well, look in the mirror!
What do you see there?
Just a foolish face - nothing more!
And now, imagine, you'll have kids around, maybe even six of them, and all of them look like you - like two drops of water!
Now you're a court counselor, an expeditor or something, some sort of boss, God knows, and then, imagine, you'll have little expeditor-lings running around, these little guys, and one of these little offspring, holding out his hands,
will tug your sideburns, and you'll pretend to be a dog: woof, woof, woof!
But they're big trouble-makers:
they'll ruin everything, throw your papers around!
- No-no-no!
..
- Let them make trouble!
They look like you - that's the thing!
Well, really, damn it, it's even funny.
some little pike, and he looks like you!
Of course, of course it's funny.
Well then, let's go.
I guess, let's go.
Hey, Stepan!
Get your master ready.
I think, after all, that there needs to be a white vest.
Whatever, doesn't matter.
There are, there are!
Let me just collect myself first -
I've been rushing around so much!
As you commissioned, I have gone through each house, each chancellory, dragged myself through the ministries, wandered around the sentries...
You know, I was almost killed, by God!
- Oh!
- Yes.
But what suitors I have found for you!
That is, the world turns and will continue to turn, but there have never been such as these!
What are they: courtiers?
All ripe for the choosing.
They'll come today.
How's that, today?
What is it?
My dear Fekla Ivanovna, I'm scared.
Don't be afraid, my dear, it's a simple matter.
They'll come, take a look, and that's all.
- And...
- Well?
How many are there?
- A lot?
- Well...
Six people.
Six?
!
It's better for the choosing:
if you don't like one, you'll like another.
Well, at least, you attracted some good ones?
Yes, of course they're good ones!
Such courtiers, the likes of which haven't been seen before.
Well, well, well!
And what are they like?
What are they like?
Wonderful, great, neat.
Balthazar Balthazarovich Zhevakin.
So wonderful, served in the navy, - he'd be perfect for you.
He says he needs the bride to have some body, he doesn't like sticks at all.
Ivan Pavlovich works as an executor.
Such an important gentleman, one can hardly approach him.
Such an imposing sight, fat;
he just starts yelling at me:
"don't tell me your stupid nothings, that the bride is like this or like that!
You tell me straight, how much liquid and illiquid assets she has!"
And then, my dear, he pasted in such a word, that it wouldn't be appropriate to repeat it in front of you.
I immediately understood: eh, I think to myself, this must be a very important personnage.
And who else?
Nikanor Ivanovich Anuchkin.
So grandiose!
And his lips, my dear, like raspberries, exactly like raspberries.
I need, he says, a bride who looks good, is well brought up, that can speak French.
And he's so slight, and has such narrow legs, so thin.
No, these slight ones aren't quite for me...
I don't know...
I don't see anything good in them.
Well, if you want someone more solid, take Ivan Pavlovich.
You can't make a better choice!
He is, one can only say, a true lord:
will barely fit through those doors, - that's how great he is.
And... how old is he?
Oh, still a young person: about 50.
And his last name?
His last name:
Ivan Pavlovich Omelette.
That's a last name?
!
Yes, a last name.
My God, what a last name!
Listen, Feklusha, how is that, if I marry him,
I'll suddenly be called Agafya Tihonovna
Omelette?
!
My dear, there exist last names in Russia, that you can only spit and cross yourself, if you hear them.
Well, if you don't like the last name, then take Balthazar Balthazarovich Zhevakin.
A great suitor.
And what... what kind of hair does he have?
Good hair.
And his nose?
And a good nose.
All in the right place.
But please do not be angry:
he has but one pipe in his apartment, and that's it, no other furniture.
And who else is there?
Akim Stepanovich Panteleev.
An official, a titular counselor, stutters a little, but he's very modest.
What do you keep going on about: official, official!
Does he like to drink, tell me that.
Well, he drinks, I won't lie, he drinks.
What can one do, he's already a titular counselor.
Well no,
I don't want my husband to be a drunk.
Well, your will, my dear, your will.
But after all, what's wrong if he drinks a bit extra every now and then, - it's not like he's drunk all week:
he's sober on some days.
Well, who else then?
There is another one, but...
God be with him!
Well, who is he?
I wouldn't even want to talk about him.
He is, probably, a court counselor, has a buttonhole, and he's very heavy and hard to raise, can't drag him out of the house.
And who else?
There are only five here, and she said, there are six!
Isn't this enough for you already?
Look, how you've..
soured all of a sudden.
What's the good in them, the courtiers?
One merchant would be as good as all of them.
Look... there's a good merchant, in the fabric business, Aleksey Dimitrievich Starikov.
I don't want a merchant!
Eh, Agafya Tihonovna!
You wouldn't say that, if the late Tihon, your father,
Panteleymonovich were still alive.
It happened, he'd bring down his whole hand on the table, and would yell:
"I don't give a damn, - he'd say, - about those, who are ashamed of being merchants."
And his hand - as big as a bucket.
Oh, how scary!
Truth to tell, he really did your mother in, or she would have lived longer.
There!
For me to have such a mean husband!
I will never marry a merchant!
But Aleksey Dimitrievich isn't like that!
- He's not like that!
- I don't want to!
I don't want to!
He has a beard!
He'll start eating, everything will drip down his beard!
I don't want to!
I don't want to!
Oh no, Arina Pantelejmonovna, a courtier would be more honorable.
"A two-story stone house..."
Here.
"Two wings:
a wing on stone foundation, and a wing on wood."
Well, the wooden one is kind of bad.
"A twin sleigh..."
"Twin sleigh with a thread, for a large rug and a small one..."
Maybe, ones that are only fit for scrap?
The old lady, however, promises that they're first class.
Do I have the honor of speaking to the father of the beautiful lady of the house?
Not at all, not with the father at all.
I don't even have children yet.
Oh, excuse me, excuse me!
You, probably, have some need of the lady of the house?
No, why...
I don't have any need, just wandered in from a stroll.
That's them: one of the suitors!
God, forgive us sinners!
The rooms aren't cleaned up!
Dunyashka!
Dunyashka!
A new napkin!
My dear, get dressed quickly!
Get dressed!
- Aunt!
..
- God, give us strength!
- Give us strength!
- What am I to do?
!
Allow me to bother you with a question?
Does the lady of the house speak any French?
- Home?
- Home?
- Home.
Please enter the room.
Wait here, they'll come out.
Wait - then we'll wait.
Just want to make sure not to dally.
I just left for a minute.
From the department.
What if the general thinks:
"Where is the executor?"
My soul, come on, clean me off.
Please.
Look, take the fuzz off the back.
Look, it's like there's a spider there, crawling.
And there's nothing on the tails?
Thank you.
Thank you, my dear.
the material is...
English!
That's why it wears so well!
Thank you, my dear!
My beauty.
In '95, when our squadron was in Sicily,
I bought it when I was still a midshipsman and sewed it into a uniform;
in 1801, under Pavel Petrovich,
I was made a lieutenant, - the fabric was completely new;
in 1814 I made an expedition around the world, it just got a little frayed at the seams;
in 1815 I retired, refaced it:
I've been wearing it ten years - still looks almost like new.
There.
There.
And how, may I ask, is Sicily... so you mentioned:
Sicily, - is that a good land, Sicily?
Wonderful!
We were there for 34 days;
the view, I would like to report, is amazing!
Mountains, pomegrenate trees,
Italian girls around, rosy, want to kiss them.
- And well brought up?
- In the best way possible.
So well brought up, like our countesses.
Really.
It happened, you walk down the street, naturally epaulettes here, gold stitching... and there are dark-skinned beauties, -
they have little balconies by each house, roofs are flat, like this floor.
So you look, a rosy one is sitting there... naturally, well, so you don't make a fool of yourself... so... well, and so she, and... naturally, dressed up:
taffeta, laces, various lady's earrings... a dainty morsel.
- Hello...
- How are you, my dear?
Thank you, my lords, well, well.
So... a most interesting, as I see it, life
in foreign lands.
Allow me to ask, with whom do I have the pleasure of exchanging words?
Zhevakin.
Retired lieutenant.
Allow me to ask on my part as well:
with whom do I have the honor of speaking?
In the role of executor, Ivan Pavlovich Omelette.
I also had a snack.
It's a bit cold outside.
I know there's a long road ahead, so, I had some anchovies and bread.
You didn't understand me right:
that's my last name
- Omelette.
Oh... fogive me.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.
So I thought, that you said, that you ate an omelette.
Yes.
What's one to do?
I was just going to ask the general, to allow me to change my last name to...
Omelettich, but my family convinced me against it:
they said, it would sound too much like "son of a bitch".
Yes, that happens.
Our whole third squadron, all the officers and sailors had the strangest last names.
And one midshipsman, and a good midshipsman, had a last name which was just "Hole".
Let me ask you,
- with whom and...
- Ah!
..
Anuchkin, Nikanor Ivanovich.
Here right in front of your eyes, that is right in front of you, - the wooden house.
With the seamstress, who used to live with the high secretary of the senate.
And across from that - another house, made of stone.
Why did you stop?
Well... you go on ahead...
I'll just get my bearings for a minute:
my boot's undone.
There now!
As if you really need to fix your boot!
You'll run away, I know it.
And really: stone, two stories!
Remember, just courage, and nothing else.
What does this mean?
Won't these be suitors?
Where did you get all these crows?
There aren't any crows here, all honest people.
A lot of guests, but their clothes are tattered.
Look at your own flight, nothing to brag about:
a one ruble hat, and your soup is without grains.
Your high-fliers probably have only holea in their pockets.
- My God, look at yourself!
- Look at yourself!
And, if I may ask you the question, in what language do people explicate themselves in Sicily?
Naturally, in French.
And all the noble ladies definitely speak French?
Yes, all of them, definitely.
You might not even believe it... what I'll tell you.
We... were there 34 days, and in all that time not once did I hear a word of Russian from them.
- Not one?
- Not one.
Sit...
Sit, I tell you!
..
Sit down!
I'm not even talking about the courtiers!
And other... senoras and...
Well,.. take for instance... one of their simple peasants, who just drags all sorts of crap around on his back,
try to tell him:
"give me some bread, brother", - he won't understand,
I swear, he won't understand;
but tell him:
"Give me some bread, brother!" - in French,..
Oh, it must be quite an interesting land,..
I see, this Sicily.
So you said - a peasant:
well the peasant, how is he?
just like a Russian peasant, broad-shouldered and... plowing the earth?
I can't tell you:
I didn't notice, whether they plow or not,..
but in terms of sniffing tobacco, I can tell you, not only does everyone sniff it, but they even put it behind their lips.
For what reason did you decide to pay us a visit?
I found out from the papers, that you would like to enter into a contract about delivering wood and trees.
And so, being in the role of an executor in these parts,
I came to find out, what kind of wood it is, in what amount, and by what time you can, mmm, deliver it.
What wood?
Although we don't take any contracts, we are happy that you came to visit.
And... what is your name?
Collegiate assessor Ivan Pavlovich Omelette.
I would kindly ask you to be sitted.
Tell me, for what reason...?
Also from the papers...
I see, they're reporting something,..
and... well, I think, let me go.
And... what is your name?
Ah... what is my name?
Lieutenant of the naval service, retired,
Balthazar Balthazarovich Zhevakin, the second.
There was another Zhevakin, but he retired before me.
Was wounded under the knee;
the bullet passed through so strangely, that it didn't touch the knee itself, but hit the tendon.
Yes-yes-yes, like sewed with a needle!
It happened that you stand next to him, and it always seems that he wants to hit you with his knee... from behind.
- I would ask you... would ask you kindly...
- Yes-yes-yes!
...most kindly to take a seat.
Ah... let me inquire, for what reason?
Neighborliness.
Being a rather close neighbor,..
That's... that's not the house of the merchant's wife Tulubova, that's across from here, where you live?
No, I currently live on the Sands.
But I nevertheless have the intention to move in here, into neighborliness, into this part of town.
Kindly take a seat.
Allow me to ask the reason?
Do you really not recognize me?
And you also, my lady?
It seems to me that I've never seen you before.
Well then...
Think carefully, you must certainly have seen me somewhere!
Honestly, I don't know!
..
- It wasn't at the Birushkins', was it?
- Exactly, at the Birushkins'!
And your name?
- Kochkarev.
- Kochkarev?
Ilya Fomich.
We're related, my wife talks incessantly about it.
Allow me... allow me: my friend.
Podkolesin.
Ivan Kuzmich, a court counselor, works as an expeditor.
Does everything himself.
He made his department absolutely perfect!
- And the name?
- Podkolesin.
Ivan Kuzmich.
The director is only there as a figure-head, but he does all the work.
Ivan Kuzmich Podkolesin.
Kindly take a seat.
Please.
Strange weather we're having.
In the morning... it was completely... and now it looks like it's passed.
Yes-yes.
Yes.
This weather doesn't seem very consistent!
Sometimes it's clear, and at other times it's completely overcast.
Very... unfortunate.
But in Sicily, my dear,
we were there during the spring.
If we convert it to our time, that would be February.
It happened, you'd go outside, look a sunny day, and then rain, then, really, you look,
and it's as if it's rain.
Most annoying, when in such weather you sit alone.
A married person - that's a whole other story:
not boring;
but alone, it's just death!
Complete death!
- Yes, you could say...
- And what, my lady, if you were to choose the subject?
- Death!
- What is your taste?
Forgive me for being so straightforward.
In what service do you think it would be best for a husband to be,
- if...
- Excuse me.
My lady, wouldn't you like to have for a husband a person, who is familiar with sea storms?
- Why be prejudiced?
- ...near... this weave...
- Why do you want to prejudice a person - ..epaulettes..
who, of course, served...
let me speak!
My lady, allow...
- What's your opinion, Agafya Tihonovna?
- Tell me, tell me: thank you,
- In my opinion, the best husband is the one - with my pleasure!
the person who alone runs the whole department!
Ah?
!
Podkolesin!
- So how is it, my lady?
- Podkolesin!
Aunt!
Sit in for me!
What does this mean?
Something, probably, happened.
Probably something about her outfit.
Fixing up the shirtfront... adding a safety pin...
- Oh, my lady,..
- What happened?
- How could something happen - nothing happened!
- My lady,..
why did she leave?
Well, you made her blush, so she left.
She asks to be excused.
- But you...
- Come for tea in the evening,
- ask us to come.
- Thank you.
Please, come for tea in the evening...
The lady isn't bad-looking, eh?
Yeah, no...
The girl looks very nice!
Yeah.
Her nose... a bit too big.
I agree with them.
She's not quite it.
And does she even know French?
Why didn't you talk with her in French?
Let me ask.
Maybe she knows it!
You think I speak French?
No!
I didn't have that upbringing.
My father was a brute, a scoundrel!
I was just a child then, it would have been easy to teach me - all it needed was some use of the belt, and I would know it!
Well, now that you don't know it, what good would it do, if she...
Oh no, no!
A woman - that's a whole different story.
She must definitely know it.
Without it, this and that - everything will be not quite right.
Oh yeah?
..
Well... someone else can care about that.
Are we going the same way?
Where, may I inquire, do you live?
Well, I guess we'll go as well?
Yes.
Please come to tea in the evening.
We kindly invite you to tea.
Please come for tea in the evening.
Please come for tea in the evening.
Well,.. a bride must still definitely know French.
- Why is that?
- Because...
Well, I don't know why, but... otherwise everything will be not quite right.
But she's beautiful, a real beauty!
Well I also...
I thought she was quite pretty, but then, everyone started saying "long nose, long nose" -
I looked more closely and also saw it, the long nose.
Oh, you fool who can't find the door in a house!
This, friend, is such a girl!
Look carefully at her eyes.
God knows, what those eyes are like - they speak, breathe!
Well, now I see it again,..
it seems as if... she is good-looking.
Listen, now that they've all left, let's go see her?
Explain everything - and that'll be that!
Well I will not do that!
But why?
What shamelessness!
Let her choose by herself.
Why do you care what the rest do?
If you want I can...
get rid of them all in a minute?
Yeah.
And how would you get rid of them?
That's my business!
Just give me your word, that you won't try to get out of it later.
Why not give my word!
- Your hand.
- Please.
I'm not taking it back.
I want to marry.
Take it.
There.
That's all I need.
Drive the lord to Kanavka, to the Semenovsky Bridge.
Really, such difficulties...
If it were one person, two - but four!
Nikanor Ivanovich isn't bad, though, of course, a bit thin.
Truth to tell,
Ivan Pavlovich is also a good gentleman, even if fat.
Balthazar Balthazarovich is also a man...
Ivan Kuzmich... is also not bad.
If the lips of Nikanor Ivanovich were added to the nose of Ivan Kuzmich, and there was some talkativeness, like Balthazar Balthazarovich has,
Dear God!
Seriously!
I think it's best to choose straws.
To put myself in God's hands:
the one who comes up, let that be the husband.
Such a sad position for a girl, especially one in love.
No man will involve himself in it, they don't even want to understand it.
Oh, if only God would let me draw Nikanor Ivanovich!
But why him?
Better Ivan Kuzmich.
God!
..
Why Ivan Kuzmich, eh?
How are they worse, the other ones?
Take Ivan Kuzmich!
Why were you scared?
Don't be afraid, it's me.
Well, seriously, take Ivan Kuzmich.
I'm ashamed,
- you were eavesdropping.
- It's ok, it's ok
I'm on your side, there's no reason to be ashamed in front of me.
Well?
Open up your face.
Well?
I'm ashamed, in truth.
Well,..
Take Ivan Kuzmich.
Really, a miracle of a person!
He's improved his department aren't arranged in the vase.
A wonderful person!
Nikanor Ivanovich is also a good person.
Oh please, he's crap compared with Ivan Kuzmich!
Why is that?
Well, it's clear why.
Ivan Kuzmich - that's a person!
Truly a Person...
a person who has no equal.
- And Ivan Pavlovich?
- Omelette?
!
And Ivan Pavlovich - crap, they're all - crap.
- Really all of them?
- Just judge for yourself, just compare them!
This one, after all, is Ivan Kuzmich;
and the rest, that's just the crap the cat dragged in:
Ivan Pavlovich, Nikanor Ivanovich.
Well?
The devil knows what that is!
But they're all so modest, at least.
What modesty!
Bullies and fighters!
The most rambunctious people!
Do you really want to be killed the day after your wedding?
!
Oh, my God!
That's really the worst possible misfortune.
Of course!
So, your advice is that it is better
- to take Ivan Kuzmich?
- Ivan Kuzmich!
Naturally, Ivan Kuzmich!
Dunyashka!
..
Where's the iron?
- So you think, Ivan Kuzmich?
- Certainly Ivan Kuzmich!
And refuse those other ones?
Of course refuse them!
But how can I do that?
!
I'm a bit ashamed!
Why ashamed?
Tell them that you're still young
- and... don't want to marry.
- But they won't believe that.
They'll start asking: why and how.
Ah!
..
Well, then, if you want to finish everything at once,
- Aha!
- then simply say:
"Get out of here, idiots!"
But how can one say that?
Just try.
I assure you, after that, they'll all run away!
But that'll come out as very rude.
But you'll never see them again, so what's the difference?
Isn't it all the same to you?
All of this doesn't seem good somehow!
They'll get angry.
So what if they get angry?
Well, the worst that can happen, is that one of them might spit in your face - that's it!
So!
..
You see?
But what's the problem?
Others have been spat at multiple times!
Really!
That's probably one of them.
Really...
I'm trembling from fright.
Well-well... too young.
Too young.
Madam, I expressly came here early, to speak with you alone, at leisure.
Well, madam, you are aware of my title, I presume:
I work as a collegiate assessor, am loved by my bosses, underlings listen, there is only one thing missing:
a friend for life.
Yes?
Now I find a friend for life, this friend - is you.
Madam, tell me straight:
yes or no?
I am still very young and am not inclined to marriage.
Hold on, hold on, then why does the matchmaker trouble herself?
Well, maybe, you want to say something else?
Explain yourself.
Madam, if this is about the last name,
I'll speak with the general.
Well, madam, tell me straight: yes or no...
- Forgive me, madam, for being so,..
- Maybe I'm early, madam,
- maybe, early.
Oh, Ivan Pavlovich!
- than good manners dictate
- Already here!
..
- But please...
- Madam, I don't have time:
- not show disrespect...
- I'm an official, - a person, who although he served
- just tell me one thing: yes or no?
- in the infantry...
- My respects, Ivan Pavlovich!
- but knows, nonetheless,..
- how to mingle with high society...
- I don't need this...
In what sense do you not need this?
- Nothing... nothing...
- Madam?
- What do you mean nothing?
- I wasn't meaning...
- Madam, just tell me one thing:
- Allow me...
- yes or no?
- Get out.
- Madam...
- Through my service...
- Get out!
- I know sea...
- Get out!
Oh my God!
What did I say?
What do you mean, "get out"?
What does that mean, "get out"?
Allow me to inquire, what are you implying by that?
- Madam,..
- What's this parable?
This is really a story!
- Tell me...
- My dear, tell me...
Tell me, please, is the bride a fool or something?
What?
Did something happen?
Started yelling: "Get out!
Get out!" The devil knows what that means!
Oh yeah, she has that in her.
Tell me, please,
- you're her relative?
- But of course, I'm a relative.
Please.
Which relative are you, if I may ask?
I really don't know!
My mother's aunt something or other with her father...
Or her father something or other to my aunt!
..
My wife knows about that: it's their business.
Please.
And has she had this for long... the foolishness?
Since early childhood.
Yeah... it would have been better, if she were smarter... though a fool is also... good.
As long as the accounts are completely in order.
But she has nothing to her name.
How's that?
And the stone house?
That's the only good of it, that it's stone.
If only you knew how it was built:
the walls are laid...
only one brick thick, in the center there is all sorts of crap - trash, wood chips, shavings.
Really!
Of course.
As if you don't know, how they build houses nowadays.
But the house isn't mortgaged yet!
Who told you that?
That's the thing: not only mortgaged, there are still unpaid percentages from two years ago.
And there's also a brother in the Senate, who also...
has his eye on the house.
The world's never seen such a quarreler!
He took the last skirt off his own mother... ungodly!
Allow me to also bother you with a question?
Yes?
I admit, I don't know French, it's very hard for me to judge for myself, if a woman knows French or not?
- Does the lady of the house know it?
- Not a word.
Really?
Of course!
I know that very well.
She studied in the same boarding school as my wife, she was a known lazy-bones, always sitting in the dunce cap.
And the French teacher simply had to beat her with a stick.
Tell your bride, that she is a scoundrel.
Cursed matchmaker!
Can you imagine, the first time I saw her,
I had some sort of premonition, that she does not speak French!
What's French?
!
You should have heard, how she described it!
House, wings!
On solid foundation!
Silver spoons!
Sleighs!
Just sit and ride!
Sit and...
Ah!
Old sinner!
Well, come over here!
- Oh, don't...
- Come here!
- Come here, I tell you!
- Oh, dear!
- The house is built
- You also told me,
- one brick thick!
- that she knows French!
- To the pawn-shop!
- But she only...
A most strange case.
This is... this would be... it seems, my... seventeenth bride.
What does she want, then?
What does she, for example, I mean.
Why?
If I were bad somehow, but it seems that you can't really say that.
Everything - thank God, nature wasn't unkind.
Reason just can't comprehend it.
A most strange case.
Funny!
I like the happiness of your demeanor.
In our squadron under captain Boldyrev there was a midshipman
Petuhov, Anton Antonovich;
also had a happy demeanor.
It happened that you would show a finger like this, nothing more, and he'd laugh all of a sudden, would laugh until the evening.
All the best, sir.
Oh, God, forgive us sinners!
And the matchmaker!
...
The match-maker!
...
A master of getting people married off!
She sure knows how to work the business!
If I marry you off, I'll really marry you off!
You're not joking?
You can make people marry?
Of course!
Whoever on whomever!
Dear sir, marry me to the lady of this house.
You?
..
Why would you marry?
What do you mean, why?
It's kind of a strange question.
It's clear why!
But you heard that she has no dowry.
My dear, if she doesn't then she doesn't.
With such a charming girl one can live without a dowry!
...so a small screen, a small room...
What did you like so much about her?
She's a full woman!
And I'm a big amateur - in the sense of full females!
- No!
..
- Sir, I'm asking you!
..
You shouldn't marry at all!
- How's that?
- Just is!
What's your figure like, just between us?
One leg shorter than the other.
- What do you mean shorter?
- Of course.
What do you look like!
Sir, this appears to concern matters of my very person!
I'm just saying this, because I know that you are a reasonable person!
Please, I'll marry you!
But only on another!
No.
I would ask you to not marry me to another.
I would like, if you would be so kind,
- this one.
- Please, I'll marry you.
But on one condition:
don't get involved in anything, and don't even show yourself to the bride, I'll do everything for you.
How can it be done without me?
- I'll need to present myself to the bridge!
- Not at all!
Go home and wait.
This very night everything will be done!
Doesn't there have to be... a certificate?
- And what about a service record?
- No!
The bride might get curious!
Nothing is required, just go home!
Oh how great that is!
I'll let you know today!
What, did they leave?
Left, left.
I just keep imagining, that one of them will return.
You can cut off my head if even one of them... so much as pokes his nose in.
I'm going to pick up...
Is it really true that he was refused, like the rest?
Completely.
It would be most embarrassing, after all, to be refused?
Of course!
- Listen, now quickly onto business.
- Yes, yes.
Talk to her and open up your heart this minute.
And demand her hand!
I have brought you, madam, the mortal, who you see here.
There has never been one so in love -
God forbid,
I wouldn't wish that on an enemy!
Well, friend, it seems that you've gone a bit overboard!
It's fine!
..
It's fine.
Be braver, he's very calm;
try to be more talkative.
Move your eyebrows a bit, you'll get him for sure, the villain!
Too bad you didn't put on a dress with short sleeves.
But then, this is also good.
Ah, Podkolesin?
Bravely!
..
Bravely!
I leave you in pleasant company.
Goodbye!
I would ask you kindly to sit.
Madam, you... do you like to ride?
What do you mean, ride?
..
It's very pleasant in the summer to ride on a boat at the country house.
Yes!
..
Sometimes we stroll with acquantainces.
It's unknown, what this summer will be like.
Hopefully, it will be nice.
You, madam, prefer what kind of flower?
The one that smells more strongly... carnations.
Flowers really suit ladies!
Yes, a pleasant activity.
You... attended which church
- this Sunday?
- I was...
In Voznesenskoy... and a week ago was in the Kazan cathedral.
After all, it does not matter where one prays, what church it is, that one just has better decorations.
Soon there will
the Ekatirenhof festival.
- It should be a fun festival.
- Very soon... is today the 8th?
... 8th, 9th... 10th, 11th, 12th... 13th, 14th... 15th, 16th, 17th...
What a brave people are brave Russians!
How's that?
!
The workers!
..
Stand on the very heights!
..
Here... today I passed by a house, the plasterer plasters and isn't afraid of anything!
Where was this?
Along the road, over which I always... always go to work.
I always go to work me!
And you already want...
Yes...
Sorry, if maybe,
I bored you...
How could that be?
On the contrary,
I should... thank you for such time spent...
But it really seems to me, that I bored you.
No, really, not at all.
Well then, if not, then allow me, another time sometime... in the evening, some time...
My pleasure...
In the evening... sometime...
What a dignifed person Ivan Kuzmich is!
Only now did I get to know him well!
It's impossible not to love him!
He's modest, sensible, and,.. most importly, it's good that he doesn't waste words at all!
I also wanted...
wanted to say two words to him...
But became timid, my heart started racing so!
And... well...
Hey, Stepan,
- have you been to the tailor?
- Been there.
- So, is he weaving a tuxedo?
- Weaving.
And he's weaved a lot of it already?
Quite: he's started to put in the buttonholes.
Really!
And didn't he ask
- why the lord needs a tuxedo?
- No, he didn't say that.
Maybe he said:
"Does the lord want to marry?"
Nope, no he didn't ask!
Really!
But you saw, however, that he had other tuxedos?
He sews them for others as well, right?
He has a lot of tuxedos hanging there!
You told him my rank, what service I'm in?
Told him, told him.
Explained, explained.
What did he say to that?
He said... said: "I'll do my best."
I am of the opinion that a black tuxedo is more solid.
Colored ones are more for those... secretaries, titular and other such small fry - they're a bit for suckers.
A court counselor - that's really a colonel, except the uniform doesn't have epaulettes.
- And did you buy the boot-blackener?
- I bought some.
Where did you buy it?
At that stand, which I told you about?
- That very one.
- The one on Voznesensky Avenue?
That very one.
- Well, did you try cleaning boots with it?
- I tried.
- Does it shine?
- Shines - it shines very well!
When he sold you the blackener, he didn't ask, say, why the lord needs such blackener?
He didn't ask.
Maybe, he said,
"does the lord want to marry"?
He didn't say anything.
Well, alright, go on.
Why are you here?
I...
And why would I have remained there?
I... already said everything there, that was needed.
So then, you already opened your heart up to her?
Except, perhaps, maybe I didn't open up my heart.
There's a story for you!
Why didn't you open up?
How do you want me to do that?
Not having talked about anything first, all of a sudden to say out of the blue:
"Madam, let me marry you!"
Then what nonsense were you talking about for a full half hour?
We talked about everything, about everything, and I admit,
I'm very happy.
She...
I spent the time... with great pleasure.
Listen, judge for yourself:
when will we have time for all of this?
In an hour we have to go to the altar at the church.
- Right now to the altar?
!
- And why not?
You yourself gave your word, you said that you are ready to marry right now.
Well and even now I am not going back on my word, but not right now.
There has to be a month, at least, of breathing room.
- A month?
!
- Well of course!
What, have you gone mad or something?
!
- It can't be less than a month!
- But I already ordered the dinner, you foolish log!
Well, listen, Ivan Kuzmich, well, don't be so stubborn, my dear.
Marry now.
Have mercy, friend, what are you saying?
How can it be now?
Well, I...
Ivan Kuzmich, I'm begging you, well, if you don't want it for yourself, do it for me, at least.
- But it's really impossible!
- It's possible, my soul, everything is possible!
Well, please, well, don't be so capricious!
Well, it's awkward, totally awkward!
What's awkward?
!
Who told you that?
Well, judge for yourself;
you are an intelligent person.
I'm not telling you that, to ingratiate myself with you, not because you're an expeditor, but from love.
Well?
..
Well?
..
Well, enough of that my dear, well, make up your mind, look at it through the eyes of a sensible person.
If only it were possible, I would...
Ivan Kuzmich!
My dear, my sweet!
Well, if you want, I'll get on my knees in front of you?
- No!
Get up!
- Well, here I am on my knees!
There, you see for yourself, I'm begging you!
I'll never forget this favor!
Well?
Well, don't be so stubborn, my dear!
- But it's impossible, friend!
Really, impossible!
- Well, but why?
!
Well, why...
Swine!
Well, swear, swear.
Please, swear all you like.
What did I put that effort in for?
!
What did I fight for?
!
All for your good, your fool!
What is it to me?
I'll abandon you now!
What's it to me?
And who asked you to fuss about it?
Please, abandon me!
But you'll perish!
You can't do anything without me!
If I don't marry you, you'll remain a fool for life!
What's that to you?
What a fool!
But truth be told, I was also being stupid!
Why do I strive so, such that even my throat is dried out!
What's he to me?
What am I: his nurse, his aunt?
Why?
Why do I worry about him, without any rest?
!
The devil knows why!
Go ask a person sometime, why he does something?
I don't want your efforts!
Well then go to hell!
I'll go!
That's the right place for you!
I'll go!
I swear to you, everything is over between us!
Don't even show your face to me anymore!
And I won't!
Go to the devil, your old friend!
I'll go!
What a fool!
Scoundrel!
What a vile, despicable mug!
I'd take you, you stupid animal, and would drive you around with flicks!
To the nose, the ears, the mouth, the teeth - all the places!
But here's the pity:
this all falls away from him, like water from a goose!
He'll keep laying there and smoking his pipe!
Stop!
But not a chance!
I have come madam,
to explain one matter to you... but I would like to know first, if it won't seem strange to you?
What is it?
No, madam,.. you tell me first, won't you think it's strange?
I don't know what it is.
But... but admit it:
probably, it'll seem strange to you, that which I'm going to tell you?
Have mercy, how could it be, that it's strange?
I am happy to hear anything from you.
But well...
You have never yet heard... this... here's the thing!
Alright!
..
I'll tell you sometime... later.
What is it?
It's...
I wanted to,..
admit, now... to announce... this and... keep being doubtful for some reason.
Why are you doubtful?
Well somehow...
I keep having doubts.
How stupid this is!
How stupid this is!
And you, madam, can see:
he's asking for your hand, wants to declare, that he can't live without you,
- can't exist!
- Have mercy, friend, what are you saying!
..
- He's simply asking,
- What are you... saying!
if you are willing to make him happy.
- What are you saying?
!
- Well then, madam?
Are you decided to bring this mortal happiness?
I could never even think, that I could provide happiness...
But after all, I agree!
Naturally, naturally!
It should have been done like this a long time ago!
Give me your hands!
God will bless you!
I agree, I approve your union!
Marriage - that's a thing... it's not just like, find a coachman and drive off somewhere.
It's a responsibility of a completely different kind, it's a responsibility...
Except I don't have time right now, later I'll tell you what sort of responsibility it is.
Well, Ivan Kuzmich, kiss your bride.
Now you can do this.
Now you have to do this.
It's ok, it's ok, madam;
this is as it must be, let him kiss you.
No, no, no, no, no, now allow me, now allow me.
Madam,..
Allow me...
What a wonderful hand!
..
Why, madam, do you have such a wonderful hand?
No, allow me to say, I want the wedding to be this very hour, without delay, this very hour.
How - right now?
Maybe this is a bit too soon.
I don't want to hear anything!
I want it to be even faster, so we can wed
- this minute!
- Bless you!
- Bravo, good man!
- Bless you!
A noble person!
I, to tell you the truth, already sent for a carriage.
You, madam, hurry now to get dressed.
Your wedding dress is already ready, I know.
Ready, ready!
Dunyasha!
Oh, madam!
It's ok, ok, ok...
Well, friend!
- Well, well, well...
- Thank you!
Now I fully appreciate your service!
My own father wouldn't do for me, what you did!
Thank you, friend!
It's ok, friend, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy myself!
Thank you!
Well, let me kiss you.
God grant that you live successfully, happily, and with plenty;
may you have many children...
Thank you.
Finally, exactly just now,
I just discovered what life is!
Now a completely new world opened up before me!
Now I see, that all of this lives!
Feels, breathes!
Somehow evaporates, somehow, I don't even know, what's happening!
..
- And... and before, before I didn't know anything...
- Happy, happy, happy!
I'll just run and check, how the carriage is doing, how's the table; and will be back in a minute.
And before I didn't understand
- any of it...
- Well-well...
I was a person lacking any information didn't reason, didn't dig deep...
Really, my heart is beating so, it's hard to explain myself.
They'll take me, lead me to the church... then leave me alone with a man...
Goodbye,.. my old girlish life!
I lived, lived..
and now I have to get married!
How many cares:
boys are a fighting lot;
and then there will be girls;
they'll grow up - marry them.
It'll be fine, if they find someone good, but what if it's a drunk?
Really, what was I up to now?
Did I understand the meaning of life?
I didn't understand!
I didn't understand anything!
Well, what was I doing, what did I mean?
Lived, lived, went to my department, served, dined, slept, - well, in a word, was the world's most ordinary and empty person.
Only now can I see, how foolish they are, the ones who don't marry!
If you look closely - how many people are so blind!
If I were a king somewhere,
I would order... everyone to marry!
Absolutely everyone!
So that in my kingdom there would not be one unattached person!
Really, when you think about it:
in a few minutes - and I'll be married!
suddenly will feel the bliss, the like of which can only... be found in stories,
that can't even be expressed, and one can't even find the words, to express it two,
three,..
four,..
five,..
- six,..
- Dunyashka!
seven,..
eight, nine...
Don't break them accidentally.
Yet, however you look at it, it even becomes kind of scary, once you really think about it.
Your whole life, forever,
to tie yourself, and afterwards... no excuses, no... no regrets, nothing, nothing - everything is done,..
everything is over.
And even now there's no way to step back:
going to the altar in a minute;
can't even leave -
there's a carriage already, and everything stands ready.
Is it really true that there's no leaving?
Naturally one can't:
there are people in the doors and all around;
well, they'll ask:
why?
No, it's impossible.
And what about through the window, eh?
No, impossible; how, it's impolite,.. and pretty high up.
Well, not really that high up:
just the foundation, and even that is low.
But no, how, it's impossible:
even my hat isn't with me.
How can I without a hat?
Awkward.
Is it indeed impossible, without a hat?
And what if I try?
High up!
God, protect me!
I don't even know what's with me!
I'm ashamed again, and trembling throughout.
Go.
If only he weren't in that room for even a second.
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Fekla, where did Ivan Kuzmich leave for?
He was right there!
Where there?
He was sitting right here, in the room!
But he's not there, as you can see!
Well, yes.
But he also didn't leave the room.
And so where is he?
I don't know, but maybe he's sitting in another room?
No, he should be right here.
- What is it?
- Ivan Kuzmich is missing.
What do you mean, missing?
- He left?
- No, he didn't even leave.
How's that - missing, and hasn't left?
Where he could have got to, I can't even imagine!
Well... there's no way he could have gone down the back stairs.
How, devil take it?
Since he also couldn't just... disappear, without leaving the room.
Maybe he's hiding?
Ivan Kuzmich!
Well, don't play games, where are you?
That's enough, come out quickly!
It's high time to go to the church!
He couldn't leave!
There is no way he could possible leave!
He's here; that room even has the hat, I put it there on purpose!
Dunyashka!
..
You haven't seen Ivan Kuzmich?
He jumped out the window.
- The window?
!
- The window?
!
Yes, and then, after jumping, got a coachman and drove off.
- Are you telling the truth?
- You're lying!
- God knows, he jumped.
- It can't be!
Even the merchant at the retail stall saw it.
Well then?
And he's the one, who knows, how to do this business.
Let me have God knows what kinds of suitors, tattered and all sorts, but those, who would jump out of a window, -
I don't have any of those, excuse me!
What, sir, was this in mockery, or what?
You thought to laugh at us?
You came to shame us?
I am living my sixth decade, and have never lived through such shame.
For that, sir,
I spit in your face!
This is nonsense,..
it's not like that, I'll go, I'll run,..
- You're a scoundrel, if you're an honest person!
- I...
I'll return him!
And you call yourself a nobleman!
- This is nonsense...
- To shame us!
To shame a girl in front of the whole world!
Yeah, just try to return him...
Don't you know the marriage business, or what?
If he runs out the door at least,..
but when the groom scurries through the window - well then I pay my respects.
Don't!
- And a nobleman at that!
- I'll return him!
- I'm a peasant, but would never do something like this!
- I'll catch up to him!
- To Kanavka, to the Semenovsky bridge!
- It seems you're only good for dirty tricks
- Faster, faster!
- and swindling...!
Shamed us!
..
Shamed us!
Shamed us!
Faster!
Stop!
To Basseynaya Street.
Why don't we go home, friend.

Maintaining.
Contact.
Auron bound contact.
Capt. Deral to the Command Cabin.
Identification.
Small.
Looks like a patrol vessel.
Coming onto visual now.
- From Auron?
- Yes.
One of their C-type patrollers.
- Crew?
- Solo.
Good.
Ideal.
Capt. Deral.
- Ginka, activate ionic beams.
- Activated.
- Obtain target coordinates from Control.
- Very well, Madam President.
- Ionic beams only?
- Just to disable, cause minimum damage.
Clinic, bring the disease pathogens in now.
I want that pilot alive.
Alive and vulnerable.
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Course, Zen.
Course 8-2-8-0-4.
Destination is the planet Earth.
- Why Earth?
- Why not?
Anywhere else in mind?
The Himalayas are quite tall at this time of the year.
Feeling homesick, are you?
As it happens, it's his idea.
There's someone there he wants to eliminate.
- Execute.
- What?
One of the Federation's para-investigators.
Notorious thug known as Shrinker.
One of his victims was a young woman called Anna Grant.
She was important to me.
So it's just revenge you're after?
Just and sweet.
You two, you approve of this?
In the absence of a more pressing engagement.
I am not asking them to kill him.
But pointless revenge, it doesn't achieve anything.
We're going home, to Earth.
Does it have to matter why?
(INTENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
(SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
(SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES)
Locking arm secured.
Good.
Bring the pilot straight up.
Are you sure we're totally immune?
I'd hardly be doing this if we weren't.
The man may suspect.
Don't forget, all the Aurons are telepathic.
Not Deral, after being hit by an ionic beam.
Let's hope not.
Ah... pilot Four-Zero.
(COUGHING)
Loss of power.
Systems failure.
Total cutout.
You were hit by a random ionic reef.
- Ionic reef?
- Probably a residual from the war.
- We ran into it, too.
- But with force shields up.
- More?
- Thanks.
Ginka, how badly damaged is the Auron patrol ship?
Its control systems are burnt out.
The auxiliary power unit is functional, but for manual operation only.
I'm continuing with further checks.
Manual only, I'm afraid.
- I'll manage.
- With reduced power?
Auron isn't so far off.
Can you supply me with the course coordinates?
Naturally.
- I only wish we had time to divert...
- No.
Since the war, the Federation breakup, our people are more cautious than ever.
- Isolationists.
- Very prudent of them.
There are so many unscrupulous fortune seekers at large.
Checking's completed.
Good.
Set course coordinates for Auron.
Right away, Madam.
Right.
I owe you my life.
Just be sure and get home safely.
(OMINOUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Since when has a personal vendetta been a good reason for going anywhere?
The trouble with the people of Auron... is that they suffer from a superiority complex.
You should get on well with them then.
Too good to become involved with the rest of humanity.
That's not true.
Just because we happen to be neutral...
Neutrality or pacifism... it all boils down to the same gutless inanity.
- You're wrong.
- "Gutless inanity"?
I like it.
What's it mean?
Some of us wanted to participate in galactic affairs.
- Yes?
- Yes.
So what happened?
Were you overruled?
The great passive majority psyched them into line.
Telepathic communion is a wonderful thing.
- I joined a group of freedom fighters.
- On Auron?
No, defending the planet Saurian Major from the Federation.
The Federation won, of course.
Yes.
I do try, though.
We're not all gutless, you see.
And the Aurons punished you for your defiance.
- Were you exiled?
- Yes.
Why do you imagine I've never gone back?
Affection for him?
(SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Auron Control to Pilot Four-Zero.
Make contact, please.
Auron Control to Pilot Four-Zero.

Not receiving you, Four-Zero.
Repeat, not receiving you.
- Still nothing?
- He's totally on his own.
We have you on visual, Four-Zero, but we are not hearing you.
Apply retro thrust.
Do you copy?
He'll burn up if he doesn't do it soon.
C.A. One.
Pilot Four-Zero, you must apply retro thrust.
Repeat, apply retro thrust.
- Do you think he's slowing?
- Could be.
Full retro, Four-Zero.
(LOUD ELECTRONIC NOISE)
Looking good.
Reentry terminating.
Well done, Four-Zero.
Stand by for hookup, stand by.
Hookup completed.
Very smooth, Retriever 1.
Standing by for docking.
Full emergency procedures operative, Retriever 1.
Patar, arrange a debriefing with the pilot, please.
C.A. Two, come with me.
A signal for you, Four-Zero.
Remain in the patroller for priority debriefing... with C.A. One and the Deputy.
Repeat, remain in the patroller... for priority debriefing with C.A. One and Deputy.
Over.
They have their priority, all right.
Survival.
They aren't all going to die, are they?
Deral, we must rebuild the Federation.
- But Auron has always been neutral.
- Yes.
And so long as it was politically expedient... they were left to their pathetic little ideals.
But the war has left us with a different situation.
General disunity and anarchy.
So, different imperatives prevail.
What about their powers of telepathy?
They'll have their narrow little minds on other things now.
An epidemic of alien pathogens.
(SINISTER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Death.
Dying.
Cally.
CALLY!
- What's wrong with her?
- They're dying.
All dying.
Who?
Who is dying?
Here, try her with this.
Should snap her out of it.
That stuff would snap an asteroid out of orbit.
Cally.
They're all dying.
Dayna, they're all dying.
Orderlies, here!
Report, Module 6.
It's here.
We've got it here.
Oh, no!
Details.
First case was an hour ago.
It started with the children.
Next, the young adults.
Thank you, Module 6.
- Any response to the distress calls?
- Not a whisper.
Appeals out on all channels.
Nothing.
- Medical section reporting.
- Yes.
Negative trace.
Non-bacterial, non-viral.
Must conclude disease pathogen of alien origins.
Yes.
From their insane Intergalactic War.
What else?
So why aren't we affected?
We were exposed to the disease first, longer than anyone.
It's your generation.
you still have a resistance to the infection.
Unlike the youngsters.
(C.A. ONE SIGHS)
So what do we do?
- Evacuation.
- It's probably Auron's only chance now.
Why aren't you at the replication plant?
- Off shift, unfortunately.
- I'm sorry.
There's still my assistant, Zelda.
Are you all right?
No symptoms?
The plant is fully sterile, sir.
Zelda, prepare a full range of genetic stock.
Get them packed immediately, ready for evacuation.
I have a different priority, sir.
- What is it, Zelda?
- To contact Cally.
That young rebel.
The Liberator must be our best hope.
We've already had distress calls out on constant transmission.
Just obey orders.
With respect, sir.
You and Cally are from the same sibling group, aren't you?
- Yes, Cally is my twin.
- Identical brain scan.
Optimum telepathic affinity.
- Forget all that and just do as I say...
- Keep trying, Zelda, keep at it.
But for you, our people might have had some natural resistance.
Your precious dream of isolation.
That policy was agreed upon in Council.
And those in opposition were simply ignored.
My father tried to warn you and so did Cally... and look how you've thanked her.
She deserved to be exiled.
You'd better just hope Zelda can get her back now.
(ZELDA) Cally.
Help us, Cally.
- Help Auron.
- Help Auron.
Let's go.
- Can we trust them?
- Yes.
Zelda would never trick me.
- Zelda?
- Her identical sibling.
There are plenty more like her on Auron, apparently.
- This is not a trap.
- Not knowingly, perhaps.
- Zen, reroute to planet Auron.
- Just like that?
Democracy.
You're outvoted, Avon. 3-to-2.
Four-to-one.
I like to stay with the winners whenever possible.
Confirm course changing to 0-3- 1-0.
Destination: the planet Auron.
State speed.
- Standard by six.
- Confirm.
I'm coming, Zelda.
I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.
(OMINOUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Their bio-replication plant.
Auron's most elegant achievement.
Synthesised placenta unit.
Each capable of gestating a batch of identical siblings.
- Of?
- Foetuses, Deral.
Offspring.
- They look quite human.
- They are.
The man who perfected the process, Franton... achieved spontaneous cell differentiation.
- No need for fertilisation.
- That's right.
- Pure genetic replication.
- Your own cells, unmated.
- One parent only?
- Exactly.
And now, since the untimely destruction of the Clonemasters... it is exclusive to Auron.
Exclusive?
So this is your reason.
Nothing to do with rebuilding the Federation.
You simply want to reproduce.
It's as well for you... that just now I happen to need men like you and Ginka...
Ioyal, unquestioning... not prone to interfering in matters of strategy.
Even so, it does seem a little excessive... too afflict the whole planet merely to indulge...
Indulge nothing.
This, Deral, is merely a bonus.
My primary object for Auron's affliction, as you call it... is to seize the Liberator.
(SINISTER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
- This is crass stupidity.
- Not from Cally's side of the scanner.
Emotional ties.
We cannot risk the Liberator for sentiment.
As long as Cally is part of this crew... she has full call on your loyalty and support... no matter what the risks.
You forget that the Aurons rejected her.
They sent her into exile.
You were exiled from Earth.
I go back as an executioner.
And you really believe revenge should rate a higher priority than mercy?
All right.
We will consult Orac.
Signal Auron Control.
Offer medical facilities.
Do we go in and dock?
I give you your orders, Ginka.
My apologies, Captain.
Do we go in and dock, sir?
- You'll get your...
- Yes.
With full quarantine precautions.
Say we're afraid of cross infection.
Under the circumstances, they shouldn't find that hard to believe.
True, Madam.
What if the Liberator is out of range of Auron's distress calls?
You're forgetting Cally.
- Her telepathy?
- Exactly.
And I'm quite sure she's capable of persuading the others.
(CALLY) Soon.
We're coming.
Tell them they must not despair.
The Liberator is on its way.
Zelda, we will be together again.
Be strong.
I'm coming home, Zelda.
I'm coming to help you.
Sir.
Your message received, Jig Nine.
Hold please.
- It's a reply?
- Requesting quarantine dockings.
- Who are they?
- It's an ex-Federation cruiser.
- All right, confirm.
- Just a minute.
- Suppose it's a trick.
- How?
This whole epidemic.
They could have intercepted our ship and infected our pilot.
- For what reason?
- Conquest.
That's ridiculous.
Surely it would be safer to wait for the Liberator.
At least we can trust them.
And we know they're coming, Zelda heard.
But not when.
Do you know how long it'll take?
Eh?
Exactly.
All right, confirm docking.
Full quarantine.
Auron Control to Jig Nine.
(TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Madam, docking facilities open.
- Quarantine?
- As specified.
Tell them to have specimens ready for analysis.
Right.
No.
Tell them to have a patient ready.
Specify Clinician Franton.
Tell them he's to wear protective suiting to withstand radiation scanning.
- Clinician Franton?
- Yes.
Their replication expert.
(ORAC) Reproduction by Clinician Franton's method of group cloning... has resulted in highly developed psychic faculties... telepathy being the most obvious example.
These faculties are, of course, limited to the young... since cloning was developed relatively recently.
We know all that.
Since I lack sensors to assess what is or is not in your mind...
I cannot assess what is or is not already known to you.
Listen, Orac, what about the disease epidemic Cally's talking about?
It's a high probability.
Because Auron has had a policy of neutrality and isolation... the planet has now been kept completely free of all disease... for more than three decades.
A sterile environment.
Without disease there would be no natural resistance to infection.
Precisely.
- Checking up?
- Why not?
There's nothing Orac can tell you that I can't.
Maybe not, but dispassionately, without prejudice or emotion.
So what's Orac's dispassionate assessment?
A trap?
We haven't got that far.
- Distress signal from Auron.
- Details.
Signal faint and intermittent.
Come on.
Requesting urgent help.
Requesting medical facilities.
Diagnostic scan complete.
Remove helmet for treatment.
Grasp the support.
Keep as still as possible.
Feet on the marks.
Ginka, that is not Clinician Franton.
- It is, sir.
- Rubbish.
Ginka, who is this woman?
She's Franton's daughter... in charge of the bio-replication plant... since her father's death several years ago.
Daughter?
Surely the man would have replicated in his own image.
It seems she was born while he was still developing the process.
Ah...
- Born of natural birth.
- Evidently.
(BEEPING)
Excuse me, Madam.
(ELECTRONIC WAVE NOISE)
There's a mirror to your left.
Shall I have her brought in here, Madam?
Please don't interfere, Deral.
I've already given Ginka his orders.
Excuse me, Madam.
Control, Liberator is on visual.
The prize, Deral.
The way to reestablish the Federation more quickly.
The single most powerful fighting ship left in space.
With that, we can command the loyalty of all factions.
Clinician Franton.
- No longer infectious.
- Total cure.
- Your therapy unit, it's miraculous.
- Thank you.
Installed shortly before the Intergalactic War.
Auron's people will be saved if we can reprogram our medical units.
I only wish that were possible.
Explain, Ginka.
It's a pathogen introduced by the aliens during the war.
Treatment is linked to the patient's individual tissue pattern.
Individual?
We can offer your people to come on board... wearing protective clothing in batches of six.
Six?
Our entire planet's infected.
If we could at least take the unit out to our medical centre.
No question of that.
Batches of six, in suits.
(SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Six at a time.
Even if only a few dozen can survive.
Where's Clinician Franton?
She's gone to the plant to prepare for evacuation of the genetic stock.
- Liberator arrival imminent, sir.
- At last.
Patar, offer immediate docking facilities.
I did, sir, but they said they're using teleport.
We're wasting valuable time.
Why don't we dock now?
Security.
But this is a mercy mission, not a war.
- Those bugs could hit us, too, you know.
- We can dock once we've assessed.
Volunteering for teleport duty up here.
We should leave two.
Dayna can bring one back up for analysis.
Okay.
It would be quicker if we took Orac with us.
It would be stupid to compound the risk.
Risk?
They're dying down there, dying by the thousand.
Orac stays, Cally.
Come on.
Good luck.
- Ginka.
- Yes, sir?
- Stand up.
- Sir.
You are addressing a superior officer.
Stand up!
- As you wish, sir.
- Yes, Ginka, as I wish.
I'm tired of your insubordination.
I'm tired of your not-very-subtle attempts to undermine my authority.
Is this an official reprimand, sir?
If it is, then I have the right to the presence... of another officer to state my case.
What exactly is your case?
Do you mean you don't know?
Is it because you were passed over for command?
You admit that I was passed over then.
Clearly, since I was made captain and you were not.
A fact you'd do well to bear in mind.
I do bear it in mind, sir.
I bear it in mind all the time.
Then act accordingly.
Or I shall have you up in front of a court martial.
I don't think the President would go along with that, sir.
You think she has some special regard for you, is that it?
I think she recognises a good officer... even if he doesn't have the right connections.
- As I have?
- Surely.
Since you were made captain, and I was not.
Get on with your work.
(SOMBRE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
- The first six have arrived, Madam.
- Get them out of those suits.
Should I proceed with the scanning process first?
There is no point.
They have to die anyway.
See to it, Ginka, and get two of those suits up here.
- Deral and I will need them.
- At once, Madam.
Control, is the Liberator docking?
No, Madam.
It is in stationary orbit.
Ah...
Then they're using teleport.
- Is he strong enough, do you think?
- Yes.
Come on.
Teleport, Vila.
So, one of your pilots was infected with an alien pathogen.
That's right.
Why didn't he report, warn you to have quarantine ready?
His communications were defective, auto systems as well.
He managed the reentry on manual, but died during docking.
- Defective, how?
- Ionic particle dislocation.
Didn't that strike you as odd?
No doubt yet another residue of annihilation from your war.
Impossible.
No warfare pathogens... or ionic reefs could have drifted this far.
Not so quickly.
They evidently have.
And our population is decimated.
At least Dayna has taken your traffic controller up to our ship.
One man.
We have to start somewhere.
He'll be scanned for both diagnosis and treatment.
And then what?
How many can you possibly save?
- Everyone's infected.
- Including us, by now.
What about the genetic tissue?
There are 5,000 on standby for immediate dispatch.
- 5,000?
All uninfected?
- Yes, of course.
How can you be sure?
It's in storage at our bio-replication plant.
Is Zelda there?
Yes, with Clinician Franton.
(BUZZING)
There's someone in decontamination.
Carry on, Zelda.
Strictly no entry.
- Let us in, please.
- The infection risk.
You obviously have cleansing procedures.
- Besides, we're not diseased in any way.
- What do you want?
A small matter of payment, in return for our medical services.
I wish to use one of your gestation units.
Replication?
That, I believe, is their function.
Is it so much to ask?
We're preparing for evacuation.
No longer necessary.
Thanks to us.
And the Liberator.
But the disease pathogens will still be infecting the planet.
No problem.
After the gestation process is complete... our medical unit can simply induct specific resistance into the babies.
The quicker you oblige, the quicker I can return to my ship... and allow the treatment to continue.
The price of mercy.
Elementary commerce.
How do you feel?
I just hope Orac can fix it.
Liberator.
- Idiot, where are you?
- Vila!
(AVON) This is not untypical.
Vila, come in.
- Yes.
- Where were you?
Precautions.
- Against what?
- Plague.
- Has Orac got any results yet?
- No.
The first batch are coming back from treatment.
Good.
Get the next six ready.
- Treatment?
- Where?
- From the other ship.
- What other ship?
The one that answered our distress call before you arrived.
Absolutely still, Tarrant.
Bracelets off, and guns, quickly!
Who the hell are you?
I give the orders here!
Not anymore.
I'm in charge.
On the floor, double quick!
Zelda.
Zelda, listen.
We're trapped in the Control Centre.
We're trapped in the Control Centre.
Zelda, prepare a placenta, please.
Is that all it takes?
A sample of blood?
It's the genetic print we need.
All body cells with a nucleus carry that.
The white cells are here.
As long as they're capable of differentiation... they're capable of growth... into another you.
Excellent.
- My bloodline, Deral.
- Or gene stock.
Yes.
(SERVALAN) Where can I speak to your Control Centre?
Over there.
Do you need me, ma'am?
No, Deral, you can wait for me here.
Cally's trapped in the...
Relax, Vila.
Orac's found the cure.
- Quite sure?
- It's even better than the other ship.
- What?
- What other ship?
The ex-Federation that answered our distress call.
Now he tells us.
Cally, Avon, Tarrant.
- Tarrant.
Answer, Tarrant.
- I'll go down.
And land us into the mess.
You stay here until we know the score.
- Tarrant.
Answer, Tarrant.
- What's going on?
Hello, Vila.
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
(MOUTHS "SERVALAN")
Time to surrender.
We have your compatriots, Vila.
Surrender the Liberator and they live.
Resist, and they die.
However, having some degree of personal regard for you, Vila...
I am prepared to make you an offer.
I'm listening.
A position of senior rank.
- Such as?
- Say, a governorship?
A planet of your choosing.
Earth, if you wish it.
- Earth?
- Lies.
I think I'll have a chat with Orac.
- We may have one advantage.
- Really?
Us.
It's just possible she doesn't know we're here.
Why?
Why have you done this?
Yes, why?
Why have you brought this on us?
I just can't believe it.
- I can't believe that anyone can be so...
- Successful?
Well, now you know.
Take them out and shoot them.
- I'm sorry.
- You're not to blame.
Aren't I?
I should have listened to Franton after all.
You did what you thought was right at the time.
Go on, Vila.
Orac says to come up here and negotiate.
Does it really?
A question of trust.
Orac can only assess veracity in person.
- I'll send a deputy.
- All right, but unarmed.
Let me go, Madam.
I'll take the Liberator.
No.
I think Deral would be a more suitable representative.
Without a weapon?
Have one.
But hidden.
It's only Vila up there and he's a coward.
Get control of that teleport, and the Liberator is ours.
My deputy is ready.
His name is Deral.
One moment.
- All right.
- Teleport.
- Welcome aboard.
- Sit down.
Over here?
- Keep still.
- So much for trust.
Disarming, isn't she?
Over there.
You tried to trick us, Servalan.
Naughty.
One hostage to us.
And three to me.
But listen, I have to go.
Set foot outside this building and you'll be instantly infected.
- But not dead.
I can still...
- I'm immune now, Zelda, cured.
One of us must stay and complete the packing.
The genetic material must be ready for evacuation.
It's Auron's only chance now.
- But...
- I'll manage.
- But I...
- You stay and alert Cally.
Tell her to be ready.
- Where is Servalan's ship?
- Down on the quarantine ramps.
Threaten it, Vila.
You're cut off, Servalan.
We have a neutron blaster sighted on your ship.
Destroy it, and you destroy your three compatriots.
- They're not on board.
- True, Vila, true.
But they are infected with the disease.
And the only cure happens to be on my ship.
I think it quite safe to return.
Ginka, bring the bracelets.
Watch them.
Is she telling the truth, Deral?
Can she really cure them?
Well?
If I help you, I'm finished with Servalan.
Friend, you're dead meat to her anyway.
Avon, Tarrant, look.
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Nice shot.
I'll take him.
I'm Franton.
The guard's gone.
You'll never get him.
- He'll alert Servalan.
- How far is their ship?
- Close.
- As soon as she knows, she'll blast us.
- There's no point in staying here.
- Where shall we go?
- There is one place that's safe.
- From those projectiles of hers?
Simply because of what's in there.
The replication plant.
Come on.
Fool!
Arm projectiles.
Prepare to fire.
- Target?
- The Control Centre.
(FAST-PACED INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
The Centre.
Come on.
- The Control Centre?
- Demolished.
Good.
Our sensors are detecting movement.
- Sector?
- Northeast.
They're heading for the replication plant.
- Ready to fire.
- Wait.
Use mark fives only.
- But, Madam...
- Ginka, I don't want that plant damaged.
Not much further.
Hurry!
Projectile attack in proximity of main Control Centre.
They stand about as much chance as a bubble in a black hole.
Unless they head for the replication plant.
What?
- It's the one possible sanctuary.
- Why?
Zelda!
No closer.
Cease firing.
Firing ceased.
Take in a ground force.
You command.
- But Madam...
- Ginka!
Do as I say.
They're diseased, Zelda.
No.
They've stopped firing.
I wonder why.
Because of these.
They're implanted with her cells.
- Servalan's?
- Her surrogate womb.
Birth by proxy.
After infecting the entire planet in the first place.
- You must be Zelda.
- That's right.
Cally?
(SURREAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
So, those little monsters give us a breather.
Not that it'll do us much good without bracelets to get us up to the Liberator.
Could be.
If they've somehow found out about Servalan's urge to breed.
- But how?
- Cally won't be short of telepathic vibes.
- Her sister's there, remember.
- Yes, but...
It's the only possible lead we have.
But if it's wrong?
If he's lying?
Just be ready to bring me straight back up.
All right, down.
You'd better be right.
- I told you to take in a ground force.
- I know, but I think you are mistaken.
- About what?
- The replication plant.
Cally, Avon and Tarrant, they must die now.
- Not in there.
- Why not?
Surely you are not that concerned for Capt. Deral's offspring.
Deral?
What are you talking about?
He persuaded Franton to remove some cells... from one of the placentas and replace them with his own.
Whose cells did he replace?
You were with him all the time, weren't you?
No.
I left him alone there, when I went to give you your orders.
The firing point, now!
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
You don't look well.
- I just hope Orac can sort us out.
- Relax.
Orac did a grand therapy job on their traffic controller.
Franton...
Zelda, you'll have to evacuate with us.
They'll be here soon, Zelda.
It won't just be bugs they're bringing.
He's right, Zelda.
Get them on.
- Ready, everyone?
- Wait, the gene stocks.
Ready?
I think it's the nutrient flow balance.
- What are you doing?
- I have to adjust it.
- There isn't time for that.
- Leave it, Zelda.
- But the foetuses will die.
- They're going to die anyway.
Vila, get us out of here.
Zelda!
Ready to fire.
Fire.
You must get out of there, Zelda.
Put the bracelet on.
Even Servalan's children must have a chance, Cally.
Zelda!
Cally!
(ZELDA SCREAMING)
(SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Servalan must have destroyed the plant.
Why would she do that?
Why kill the babies?
Even her own babies.
Ginka.
Ginka!
We got them.
You lied.
You lied to me.
They were mine.
I felt them die.
(SCREAMING)
- Deral.
- What?
Tell Servalan she missed us.
It was for nothing.
All of it was for nothing.
And tell her Auron's children will return.
You can't.
No?
Happy landings.
Deral.
Well?
No!
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
- Feeling better?
- Yes, thanks to Orac.
- Did you look in on the others?
- They're fine.
- And Cally?
- She'll be all right, she's sleeping.
Zen, course.
Course 0-3-K-2-0 for the planet Kahn.
Kahn?
It is within the specified parameters.
An uninhabited Earth-type planet capable of supporting an Auron colony.
- Flight time?
- 40 hours at present speed.
Increase speed.
- No, Avon.
Let's not rush it.
- Why not?
The gene stocks that Franton has, contains the potential for 5,000 children.
Franton and Patar are going to be busy on Kahn.
Maybe we should let them rest.
Maybe we should.
It's likely to be the last rest they'll get.
Zen, maintain present speed.
What about Cally?
You think she'll want to go with them?
Cally will stay with us.
We are closer to her than they are.
Besides, a nursery of 5,000...
Would you want to go with them?
(THEME MUSIC)
(upbeat music)
[Announcer] This is Zane Kowalski with highlights from the Orange Bowl Stadium in Miami.
Wearing white jerseys we have the Army, with Navy in red.
So we have a first down for the sailors.
Center hike to Jim Hooper, Navy's all-star quarterback.
Let's go Army!
[Announcer] Navy six, Army zero as Army kicks to Navy.
It's a long, high kick almost to the 20 yard line, received by number 45, Navy fastback.
And look at him go!
He's at the 50 yard line, down to Army's 30, 20, he's going to score and there it is!
Yay!
[Announcer] Touchdown, Army.
That was an 80 yard run by this boy who was born in Venice, Italy who holds the season league record.
Place your money on Army, take it from me,
I got inside information.
Navy's just a bunch of cripples.
Never got the point in beating a dead horse.
[Announcer] Now it's Army fighting back and we have a first down on Navy's 10 yard line and center hikes to Army's quarterback Casey Johnson and he's going to run it.
He's across the 10 and it's Navy's fullback Bruce Navis who blocks him and he comes down with less than a yard to go.
What a game, ladies and gentlemen.
It's another first down for Army on Navy's foot yard line.
Center hikes number 12, Johnson gets the ball to Donnie Brown and he fumbles it!
After a great season, Army seems to be falling apart.
Navy's in complete control of the game.
In 20 years of sportscasting I've never seen such a one-sided contest.
(groaning)
What's eating you, Sister Suzanne?
You didn't want Navy to win, eh?
Oh Johnny, it's just that I bet 10 dollars on Army.
They told me it was a sure way to raise funds for the orphanage.
Right.
It's better to bet on St. Joseph.
Gambling never pays, kid.
Is that for real, Charlie?
Don't you gamble?
Never.
People that gamble lose.
Personally I like to win.
(blowing horn)
(muffled announcer speaking)
[Announcer] This is no Sunday trip around the bay.
Those (mumbles) are moving and have been taking off for hours.
The contest is now over.
Second and third place, (mumbles).
He has the race in his back pocket.
Magnificent.
We're gonna win again.
Ah, wish I could be so sure, sir.
What do you mean by that?
What does he mean by that, Sullivan?
Look, our man's in front out there.
I know he's in front sir, but he hasn't won yet.
(cheering)
Hey (mumbles), something ain't working, the wrong guy's winning.
Get on it.
Hey, greaseball.
Something ain't working.
The wrong guy's winning.
You know what's gonna happen if the wrong guy wins.
No, I did everything like you told, just wait to see.
[Announcer] We have an upset, folks.
Number 96 the favorite is out of the race.
It's a real pity his boat broke down, huh?
Favorite's out of the race.
Damn.
(coughing)
Where is he?
Where is he?
I'll kill him.
Come on out, let's see ya!
Hey, have you seen a guy in overalls with grease on his face?
Why don't you go find a mirror?
Hey, I know you.
You're the guy who brought my boat down here, aren't you?
What's it to you?
What's it, someone's been fooling with the engine!
I couldn't care less.
Is that beans and onions?
[Charlie] No, it's fish and chips.
I like beans and onions.
Hey, you wanna flip a coin for it?
Heads I win, tails we share it.
I don't gamble.
What's more, I don't like guys that try to help themselves to my beans.
Hey, wait a minute, you're the guy I'm looking for!
(groaning)
You're the turkey messed up my engine, aren't you?
Your beef is with those guys.
Stand aside, Samuel.
You were warned to keep your trap shut!
Hey just a second...
Mind your own business!
(yelling)
Hey, hey come back here!
That clown a friend of yours?
I don't have any friends.
Hey, that smells good.
Beans and onions.
I like beans and onions.
Sorry pal, they're mine.
(hits) (screams)
(clanging) (crying out)
(groaning)
I like beans and onions.
Come back here, you stop!
I'm gonna teach you to go messing around with my motor.
Excuse me Lieutenant, Admiral O'Connor wants to speak to you sir, it's urgent.
Okay, here, put him in the brig.
Move it.
Let him (mumbles).
Your personal record is impressive, Lieutenant.
Anapolis, graduated cum laude in infinitesimal calculus, winner of last year's California Classic, all-American football, interstate soccer.
Now I don't get this runner up in the inter-American middle weight boxing tournament.
How come you didn't come in first?
Well sir, Carlos Muzon was first.
Oh, well.
Lieutenant, what I'm about to say to you is to be considered top secret.
Now you're probably unaware that organized crime has become a serious threat to the Navy sports program in Florida.
Unfortunately the local police force is, well, not up to our standards.
So we've decided to clear decks, Lieutenant, and help out and our personnel computer has selected you for the job.
It'll be risky, yes.
Now, you'll need someone who knows the ropes and we found just the man to use to our advantage.
I've got a feeling I know him.
Well, we're off to a good start then.
Well he sure didn't look that pretty.
You mind if I?
[O'Connor] Go right ahead Lieutenant.
Yeah, that's him.
(upbeat music)
Thanks so much, Charlie.
God will reward you.
If it were not for you,
I'd never be able to get around like this.
Ah it's okay, it's a pleasure, Sister.
Anything I can do to help you.
You're an angel.
I know.
Look, it's none of my business but even though the orphanage is in financial difficulty, when you get to the race track don't take a tip from the first (mumbles) who comes along.
Make more selling rosaries.
The Lord moves in mysterious ways.
Yeah, so do horses when you get the right odds.
There you go.
Oh wait, Charlie!
Yeah?
How is it you never married?
Well, I, how about you?
Oh, well I married Christ.
You mean I should marry the boss?
Oh.
Right, he's not my type.
(engine starting)
Bye, sister.
Bye!
Wave to Charlie!
Bye!
(dolphins squeaking)
Okay, okay.
You getting hungry, eh?
(dolphins squeaking)
Let me pop in this diner and get something to eat just down the road.
(dolphins squeaking)
(pinball dinging)
Hiya, Bob.
Hiya Charlie.
You got any fresh fish?
Yes, we got fish.
He's been playing that same ball for the past 45 minutes.
Eh.
Give me 35 pounds.
35 pounds of fish?
You heard the man.
And I bet he wants it raw.
[Bob] Raw?
Is that right, Charlie?
Yeah, I want it raw.
I also want a triple hamburger and three beers.
And cake with lots of whipped cream.
Funny, I didn't know that.
[Charlie] You didn't know what?
That raw fish goes with beer.
I would have chosen a nice chilled white wine.
(sneers)
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi.
(sneers)
(chuckles)
Oops!
Good catch.
You like onions and beans, don't you?
Here you are, Charlie.
Here's your triple hamburger.
Nice.
Hey, how about that.
About what?
I'm up to eight million points.
Don't you think I deserve a discount for orange juice?
Yeah sure why not, 10 cents a glass.
Hey, you wanna bet a nickel...
I don't gamble, blue eyes.
I'll bet you a nickel that I can drink more orange juice than you can squeeze.
That's impossible.
Impossible!
Come on, I'll bet you a nickel.
Okay, the bet's on.
(juicer buzzing)
I'm full, that's enough, Bob.
You win.
Here.
I'm going back to the pinball machine.
See that Charlie?
Anyway man, I should have doubled the stakes.
How many oranges you squeeze?
I don't know, about 10 I guess.
For five cents, you got a lot of smarts.
(laughs)
Oy vey.
Two of you stay here.
You two come with me.
(laughing)
Listen you half-assed little monkey, I've been told you refuse to have one of our slot machines in your joint.
You're darn right, I got a pinball machine, don't need one.
And pinball machines don't have our seal of approval.
Talk to them other guys.
Out of the way, you.
Hey sorry.
(smashing)
Hey, hey stop that!
Stop, please, you're breaking up my business!
How am I gonna explain that?
It's a rented machine!
You broke it, how am I gonna explain that?
(muffled yelling)
(laughs)
Here you are, Bob.
Thanks, Charlie.
I really wish you hadn't done that.
It ain't fair to shove the little guy's face into the cake, especially when the cake is mine.
Shh.
Shut up.
Talking to me?
Yeah.
(chuckles)
(hits)
It's a wiseass.
Stick 'em up.
Or you'll look like Swiss cheese.
You turkeys!
He's holding the pool cues on you!
(hitting) (shouting)
(light piano music)
[Charlie] Hey blue eyes, get me a cue ball.
Your nails are filthy.
Bad boy!
Bad boy!
(crashes)
(groaning)
(crashing)
Let's get the hell out of here!
[Man] Alright already.
I just got smacked, come on, go go go!
(crashes)
[Driver] Who put the phone box there?
Look over your shoulder, come on, come on!
[Man] We're making a getaway, this isn't a demolition derby.
[Driver] I forgot it wasn't a truck.
(ringing)
Hey, jackpot!
[Charlie] Now you can pay for the orange juice.
My name's Johnny.
My name's Charlie Firpo.
Charlie Firpo?
The famous Charlie Firpo?
The number one gambler on the Gulf Coast?
Pleased to meet ya!
The pleasure's all yours.
Bob, give me the fish.
Here you are, Charlie.
No, you don't have to do that.
Come on, take it.
Okay.
Mr. Firpo, would you mind giving me a lift to Miami?
I'm going there too.
How'd you know I'm going to Miami?
Huh?
'Cause that's where they have the aquarium with the dolphin and you're transporting dolphins, so.
How do you know what I'm carrying in my rig?
How do I know?
Hmm.
By simple deduction.
I figured no matter how big and ugly you are you couldn't possibly eat 35 pounds of raw fish.
You're really on the ball, ain't you?
Well.
How come you don't know I gave up gambling?
And I don't give lifts to strangers.
Have a nice walk.
Charlie?
Wanna bet you're gonna give me a lift?
I'll put up all I got from the slot machine.
That money's all for Bob.
To cover the damage.
You're right.
About your offer.
I took the pledge, gave up betting for good.
But this time I'll make an exception.
Oh yeah?
If you get me to give you a lift.
I promise you I'll swallow all 35 pounds of this raw fish.
That's a deal.
Okay.
Bye bye, blue eyes.
You don't like beans and onions?
(shakes head)
(upbeat music)
Got the bags?
(whistling)
Sister I bet you knew I'd show.
Didn't you swear you wouldn't bet anymore?
Hi there.
Okay ball breaker.
You gonna get out by yourself or am I gonna throw you out?
I'm surprised at you, Charlie Firpo.
When a gambler loses he respects the rules and I won the bet, didn't I?
[Charlie] I won the bet, didn't I?
Hold it!
Alright, I haven't got the heart.
Anyway, it isn't fair to deprive the dolphins of their daily bread.
I mean daily fish.
(dolphins squeaking)
Hey, they're saying the fish is not fresh!
Don't get mad, I'm just the interpreter.
I really speak their language.
Wanna see?
Hi there.
(dolphins squeaking)
No kidding, she says your driving makes her seasick.
Have a nice day.
Listen blue eyes, you can talk to the trees for all I care.
What I'd like to know is why are you sticking to me like I was fly paper?
My gypsy granny used to say it's all written on your hand.
Let me see.
Aha.
Born under the sign of Taurus.
Irish father and unknown mother.
Bachelor, you're very shrewd and resourceful.
You've got a kind heart and you've got a scar on your bottom.
Okay now you hear this, wiseguy.
You so goldarn smart then you oughta know you're running one heck of a risk.
You quit polluting my environment.
Look, take it easy.
I'm not trying to be funny.
I'm trying to help you, Charlie Firpo.
Help me?
You bet.
Wanna know something?
No.
I'll tell you anyway.
I read on the palm of your hand that one of these nights they are going to steal your truck.
When it happens, don't go around saying I didn't warn you.
Now listen, this is between you and me.
Anyone tries to rip off my truck and they're in for a big surprise.
(yawning)
Where are we?
For you it's the end of the line.
I'm tired, it's my turn to sleep now.
I got a long haul tomorrow if I'm gonna keep my schedule to Miami.
Hey, what do you say to a round of poker?
This joints got to have a game going.
Get out.
You're on my pillow.
Get out, get out.
What am I gonna do now?
I'm wide awake?
Why don't you read your palm?
Great, thanks a lot pal.
You'll be sorry.
(upbeat disco music)
Beer please.
Hey there.
Hey yourself.
You're not from around here.
Are you going to play that beer?
You like dice?
Actually I like cards better.
Like poker.
Only I'm not very good at it.
Well you're lucky, rough stuff.
My name's Johnny.
I'm here with some friends right now.
They're playing poker, there's a red hot minute.
Bores the hell out of me.
But if you like, I'll introduce.
That's a good idea.
Let's go, baby.
Yeah, come to daddy.
Hey boys, got a friend here who'd like to join in the fun.
I don't know.
I'm not very good.
Yeah well none of us is great shakes neither.
Have a chair, join the game.
- Dippo, Fingers...
- Hi.
This is Bugsy, and I'm Nynfus.
And this is rough stuff.
Name's Johnny.
Thanks baby, now go back to the bar.
Okay.
Go ahead, deal him in.
See you later, rough stuff.
Name's Johnny.
Bring us some sandwiches.
Go ahead.
I meant cut the deck.
Oh yeah.
(mumbles)
I got it!
What do I win?
The prize is you get to deal.
Oh.
Oh, sorry.
Thank you.
(bangs)
Ouch!
Sorry.
Not to me, to the right.
Oh, sorry.
Thank you.
You gotta ante up first, eh?
$10.
I'll do it.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Five, right?
Thanks.
Yeah, five.
Which is higher, ace or king?
The ace.
Thank you.
I'm out.
Four cards.
You won.
Oh yeah?
(laughs)
It's my lucky night, I can feel it.
(light snoring)
How'd it go?
Huh?
Oh great.
I lost $1,283.30.
Yeah plus the $10,000 you still owe us.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I told you guys, I haven't got it.
Would you take an IOU?
Oh no, you're gonna pay in cash, right now.
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna end up like Joe Damiro.
Remember Joe Damiro in his cement shoes?
Joe Damiro?
Not really.
I've always been bad with names.
Jog his memory.
Move your trousers, baby doll.
Hey now you guys, take it easy.
Listen to me.
I've got a truck outside that's worth much more than $10,000.
Why don't I pay you off with that?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Why sure, I saw a truck outside.
See?
Okay.
Now what you're gonna do is sign us a transfer of ownership and don't forget your phone number and the truck's registration.
Sure thing.
Oh yeah and make it out in favor to Nynfus Corporation.
Wait a minute, who's this corporation?
Bugsy, you're a jerk.
(cracking)
It's all yours.
Take this and put it away in the safe.
Hey you're a real crook.
Truck's worth twice what he owes.
What do you got rocks in your head?
Mind your own business!
Excuse me, but this beautiful young lady's got a point there.
I mean, it's not a four wheeler.
Could you just give me a couple hundred dollars so I could rent a car?
Okay.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Hey, just a minute.
I guess I should warn you I left a bum sleeping in the cab of the truck.
I picked him up along the way.
If he should make a fuss, just throw him out.
Don't worry.
Thanks baby, I'll remember that.
And I'll always remember you, rough stuff.
What's wrong with Johnny?
It's an okay name I guess, just like rough stuff.
'Cause I think you're sweet.
(snoring)
I wonder what he's carrying in the trailer.
What's the difference?
We only want the truck.
Can I drive, boys?
Bugsy, you're a jerk.
This thing's worth about 40 grand.
Rise and shine buddy, let's get out of the truck.
It's okay officer, all the papers are in order.
Brakes, lights, all okay, goodnight.
Pull him out.
Hey you, out huh!
Why?
Why?
He says why.
'Cause it now belongs to us and we want to take it home.
Hey...
'Cause it now belongs to us and we wanna take it home, see?
Where?
He says where.
It's none of your business, now step out of there.
Move or I'll pull you out by the beard.
Getting very impatient.
You get the picture?
(crying)
What's he doing?
First.
I'm sleeping and somebody wakes me up abruptly.
I always cry.
Second.
When I cry I get upset and when I get upset, then I gotta get up.
And when I get up I get mad.
And when I get mad, I gotta get it out of my system.
If you didn't cry, it wouldn't get to you!
(chuckles)
(hitting) (crying out)
Oh, I'm sorry boss...
You're a jerk!
Hey you, wait a minute!
Right.
Wait a second.
See you around, Charlie Firpo.
Hey, where you going?
Hey, you can't do that!
My rig, my rig!
(upbeat music)
Yeah, easy for you to say.
Sure.
As least you're covered by insurance, and the dolphins too.
How am I supposed to work now without my rig?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I saw who it was.
The only thing I know is that his name is Johnny.
No, the guy (mumbles) is called Johnny.
There's at least 10 million people in this country called Johnny.
Yeah, 10 million people.
Give me a beer.
Come on, cappy.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
Yeah.
Is there a big guy here named Charlie with a beard who looks mad?
Just a minute.
Hey Charlie.
It's for you.
You wanna take it on the phone you just called from?
Yeah, who's speaking?
[Johnny] We have a collect call for Mr. Charlie Firpo.
Are you Mr. Charlie Firpo, sir?
Yeah.
[Johnny] Will you accept the call, Mr. Firpo?
Who's calling me?
[Johnny] The party's name is Johnny.
No!
Uh yes, yes, give me Johnny.
[Johnny] Right away, deposit 50 cents, sir.
50 cents.
Hello?
[Johnny] Excuse me sir, 25 cents more, please.
Can't get away with nothing these days.
Hello?
Hello Charlie?
This is Johnny!
How are ya?
I'm going bananas.
Where's my truck?
Where are you?
And how'd you know I was here?
You're not carrying a grudge, I hope.
Who me?
No, I'm not mad.
I just want to give you a big hug, coochie coochie.
Now please, won't you tell me where you are?
Actually I'm not far from you, Charlie.
But if you want to see me, come to the (mumbles) speedway, you know the record room?
Yeah.
Good, I work there.
You better be there.
Now please, please tell me where the rig is, tell me.
Sorry sir, you have to deposit six dollars and 25 cents.
Hello Charlie, bye Charlie, hope to see you soon!
Bye bye, Charlie.
Just a minute, please!
Operator, operator, operator!
Hey Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Just get my hands on him.
(light band music)
Hey the race is about to begin, pal.
I'll give you double your money.
How about it, baby?
Yeah, alright.
I'll tell you what, give me 20 bucks on 43.
Just to place.
You've got it.
Hey, you need a mechanic?
I could fix any kind of car.
We don't fix cars here, we smash 'em up, buddy.
I'm the best wrecker in the business.
Yeah, you wanna drive for my team?
My best boy broke his leg this morning.
Give you $50.
Just be sure you don't win.
Come on, I'll show you the car, we've got about 10 minutes.
What's 32 pay?
Five to two.
$50 to win.
143.
No one's betting on you today so we souped up your machine.
You'll be impossible to beat.
The boys have spoken to the other drivers.
The track'll be like cruising down the freeway.
You get one of these when you win, okay?
It's fine with me.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Lou Spurling giving you a great welcome from the (mumbles) Speedway.
We have two minutes to start time of today's demolition derby and these cars are all high-performance machines.
Yeah, it looks like it's gonna be a great race.
Cars are out on the track, just about to complete the promotion lap.
And here they come, past the stands, they line up on starting grid.
With just under 60 seconds to go.
And we have a latecomer, number 26, sponsored by Tom's Tires.
Grabbing a space in time for the lineup.
Hey, you miserable little runt!
Where's my rig?
Oh say, it's Charlie Firpo!
I'm glad to see ya!
Now darnit I asked you a question, where's the dolphins and my rig?
Oh, I turned 'em loose!
You know, I felt sorry for 'em.
Start of the race.
(engines rumbling)
(cheering)
First turn, number 26 making a bid for fifth, he's got it, sixth place, number 37, right behind 26 who's moving up on third place followed by 37.
Bumper to bumper, 26 has the lead, look out he's sideways, he's gonna lose it.
37 is gaining ground, moving up on the outside.
They've left the traffic behind.
[Charlie] Okay blue eyes, where's my rig?
What?
[Charlie] My rig!
What?
I'm warning you, where's my rig?
You drove off in it.
Oh, your truck.
I lost it playing poker.
You know how it is.
Easy come easy go, Charlie.
What were you doing gambling with my truck?
I want something to win and buy one myself and work with you!
Great idea, blue eyes.
26 is staying right with him, you'd think they were married.
Hey, you know (mumbles).
Look at that 37!
What the hell is going on?
Don't ask me, you were the one that told him he should lose.
58 is trying to put up a challenge but he ain't got a snowball's chance in hell.
This is neck and neck.
Did 37 get the word?
Hey I told him boss, just like you said.
That 26 was to win.
This is a double-cross, someone'll pay.
(mumbling)
37 is back in first place.
26 is pulling back on the track.
He comes past the stands with seven laps to go in this race, it's 37 out in front, he's about all sewed up.
It's 26 and he's driving his heart out.
Moving up the track, passing one car after another.
33, seven, moving up towards 62.
Coming around (mumbles) out of control, they're all taking the curve.
(tires squealing)
26 just keeps moving up, look at him go.
He's fourth, he's third, he's second, he's right on the bumper of 37!
And he makes another turn.
They're running neck and neck!
Hey, meet me off the track and I'll kick your ass
(mumbles).
I'm ready.
37 is taking no slack.
How long can he keep up this pace?
Wait a minute, where they going?
Stop, stop!
(crashing)
Let's go get him.
(hitting) (shouting)
(laughs)
Alright fatso, now I'm gonna trim you down to size.
Look out, it's an earthquake!
Hey, that fat ox made you lose.
Why you taking his side?
That fat ox, huh?
That fat ox happens to be my brother.
(light music)
You have pistachio?
Pistachio's melted.
Tutti frutti or caramel toffee.
Tutti frutti.
Charlie, how could I tell you right away
I was your brother?
You might have, you might have held it against me.
I wanted us to be friends first.
You know, you always blame me, you always blame me 'cause our father left your mother to marry mine.
Nice guy, your father.
Like a sailor with a woman in every port.
Hey!
How could you say such a think about our papi?
Know what?
I've done some figuring.
I only need to sell 137 million of these.
Thank you, kid.
Before I raise enough for the down payment.
Why wait, Charlie?
I mean, a guy like you, a real genius at cards.
You got it made.
In one month you can make enough money to buy yourself 10 trucks.
Gambling's for suckers.
The house want you to drop a bundle it don't matter how good you are.
I got an education.
When I was dealing in that casino for Paragoulis.
The Greek in Havana.
Your eyes would have turned green at the crookings.
I smashed everything there to little pieces and left.
I heard you broke The Greek's nose, too.
Hey.
Pass me a cone, will you?
Tutti frutti or caramel toffee?
Pistachio.
Pistachio melted.
Vanilla, tutti frutti, caramel toffee, bitter egg, and coffee.
Okay, then give me a vanilla cone with pistachio.
The pistachio melted.
Vanilla, caramel toffee, tutti frutti, bitter egg, and coffee.
Okay look, just give me a chocolate cone with a little pistachio.
What are you, deaf?
The pistachio's melted and I didn't say chocolate.
Wow, don't get so excited.
I was just asking.
Alright, what do you have again?
We have vanilla, tutti frutti, caramel toffee, bitter egg, and coffee.
Oh I got it.
Then give me a big mix, grandma.
Tutti frutti, caramel toffee, vanilla, bitter egg, and coffee.
Tutti frutti.
Hey, don't forget the pistachio.
(cheery music)
Hey salami, guess what I got for you?
Oh, thanks.
I thought you said it melted.
I changed my mind now.
What'd you say?
I said I love pistachio.
Bet your sweet ass.
You know everything about me.
Let's hear a little about you.
How come you learned to converse with the fishes?
Well I've done just about everything.
I've been a waiter, salesman, dockworker, shoe repairman, mason, halfback, I've been...
Instructor, yeah, I know, jack of all trades, master of none.
I had to do it.
I had to do it for papi.
You walked out on him.
Who do you think took care of him?
Don't speak to me about him.
Made life miserable for me and mama.
Lousy bum couldn't even get a job.
10 years ago I walked out on him.
So help me one of these days he crosses my path again,
I'll show him.
Save your breath.
You won't be able to show him anything no more.
Why?
'Cause...
Come on, why?
'Cause papi's blind now.
(whistling)
(laughs)
I sold it to pay for an eye operation for him, that's why I stole it, Charlie.
But then I lost all the money gambling.
I must have been taken by every shark from Mexico to Florida.
Hey, there he is.
(playing ukulele) (singing)
Where did he learn those words from, your mother?
Believe me, I've always done my best to give him enough to live on.
But he wants to sing.
It makes him feel he's on his own.
He's hard-headed.
He thinks he has a nice voice.
Papi!
Papi!
Who's that, my boys?
[Charlie] Papi!
My boys, my boys!
(crashing)
Hi Papi, I brought you Charlie!
It's me and Charlie!
My boys, my boys!
Charlie, Charlie, it's Charlie, oh Charlie you feel more like your mother every day.
Oh Charlie, Charlie, my boys.
Come on, come on!
(shouting)
Charlie's right, Papi.
You'll be happy here.
Everything is so beautiful.
I only wish you could see it.
Sister Suzanne will take good care of you.
And Johnny and me'll find a way to raise the money for your eye operation, don't you worry.
Thanks, Charlie.
You see what those bastards done to me?
Charlie, that's when he went blind.
After they beat him up.
And only because I'm your father.
I'll give you back your sight, Papi, if it's the last thing I ever do.
How much this operation cost?
Oh not much, $100,000.
$100,000?
Does that including green stamps?
It's a very difficult operation.
Besides, Papi wants blue eyes, and you know blue eyes cost more.
Hey Papi, how about some other color?
You see just as good, eh?
It's that or nothing.
Like father, like son.
Ah, the prettiest nun since Jennifer Jones.
In For Whom The Bell Tolls?
No, that's Gary Cooper.
Hiya, Sister.
I thought you'd all like some tea.
Let me pour you a cup, Mr. Firpo.
No no no no, I want to serve myself.
I'm self-sufficient.
Certainly are, Papi.
Here, let me help you.
This is the teapot.
And this is the cup.
Now there you are.
Hold the cup nice and steady.
Is it good and hot, Sister?
It is?
Ah, Papi, Papi!
That's it, that's fine.
Milk or lemon?
Lemon, lemon.
Let me do it, let me do it, let me do it.
Papi, please.
I think it's better somebody else squeezes your lemon.
Oh I do hope your father can stay here until the operation because as I told you in about a month we will have to move from here.
How we gonna raise $100,000?
That ain't easy in the best of times.
We'll make it, Charlie.
'Cause we'll do it together, like brothers.
Papi, Charlie will teach me to become as great a gambler as he is.
We'll go to all the legal gambling spots in town.
And if that isn't enough to make the $100,000 we need,
Charlie can always introduce me to Paragoulis The Greek.
He's the one who roughed up Papi, you know.
He knows where he hangs out, don't you?
Yeah, well, yeah, I know where he is, but you don't know Paragoulis The Greek.
He's too much for you to handle, he's dangerous.
Nothing is too dangerous for the Firpo brothers.
And Papi's worth it, right?
Okay, okay, so okay, we win enough for the operation.
And a new truck for me.
And after that we quit, right?
Right, right good.
And Papi loves Firpo brothers.
Right!
Bye bye.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I'm happy to be able to return the favor after all you've done for me.
We will take good care of him.
Come on, Mr. Firpo, I'll show you to your room.
Thanks.
This way.
But I can get out of here sometimes can I?
I mean quite often?
Of course you can, Mr. Firpo, this is not a prison.
Ah, that is exactly what I wanted to hear.
Oh, and Sister?
Yes?
Could I please have a television set in my room please?
Of course you can.
What did you say?
A television?
Oh yes, I love to listen to the dog races on TV.
(laughing)
(cheery music)
Now here's what we do.
Sixth race we bet $100 on a favorite.
But shouldn't we pick a horse that gives better odds?
The race is fixed.
If you want to learn, don't ask questions.
Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
See the guy in the checked jacket?
That's what's called a bookie.
At racetracks they come out of the woodwork.
And they all work for the syndicate.
Now I will approach one of them and put the $100 on the favorite.
Then we make sure the favorite wins.
You wait here.
Hiya Charlie, it's good to see you again.
Can I buy you a drink?
I'm gonna show my friend that betting with you is better than at the window.
Good.
You're gonna take $100 on Lightning Rod, number seven.
And instead of two to one, I'll take 11 to one.
11 to one?
Yeah.
Okay, but what should I do with this ticket?
Why don't you eat 'em?
Eat 'em?
Yeah.
A beer.
Hey there.
Hey yourself.
What are you doing here, betting on the nags?
Only on the ones that win.
I got a sure tip for you.
There's a killing to be made on the sixth race.
Lightning Rod.
No, Lightning Rod's the favorite, but he won't win.
Bet on Cookie, he'll come in first, it's all taken care of.
They had a word with the jockeys, if you understand.
Thank you.
Catch you later.
Yeah, you bet.
It's just like you said, they're clamoring to put money on Lightning Rod, over 50 grand so far.
What'd you expect, he's the favorite.
You bet he's the favorite.
And that nag had better not win, or we'll be up the creek.
Don't worry, the driver knows the life of his little baby's at stake.
He'd break the horse's legs first.
Why don't we go now?
What do you mean, go?
If we hurry we just have time to throw ourselves under the Miami New Orleans express.
The tracks are about 50 yards from here.
What is it, you think that's funny?
Come on.
You think it's funny?
That you're gonna lose all the cash we have to our name?
My fairy godmother just gave me a hot tip.
Lightning Rod is not gonna win.
Yeah?
Well you wait and see who's gonna win.
Well, what do you want?
Lightning Rod's driver.
Hold on a second.
Hey, are you Lightning Rod's driver?
Yeah, why?
You're wanted on the telephone.
Jeez, I hope nothing's happened to the kid.
Hello?
Who's calling?
Hello, hello?
[Charlie] Just sit back, leave the driving to us.
Hey, that doesn't look like Lightning Rod's usual driver.
Sure it's him, what do you think it is?
Hey, what you smiling at?
I'll smile at whatever the hell I want to.
[Announcer] They're lining up behind the starting line folks for this evening's sixth race.
Look at those drivers, they're all...
Hey buddy, you're not Sam Stallion.
Of course I'm Sam Stallion, don't you recognize me?
I'm not that stupid, you're not Sam!
Why don't you call me and see if I answer you?
Hey Sam hi.
Oh hi!
See?
[Announcer] And they're off and running!
The favorite, Lightning Rod, is on the inside.
(announcer drowned out by cheering)
Lightning Rod seems to have gotten himself boxed in.
Cayenne Pepper's still at the front, followed by (mumbles).
Positions are unchanged as they go into the first turn.
(mumbles) is challenging Cayenne Pepper.
There's quite a tussle going on out there.
In the back stretch it's still anybody's race.
But now it's Lightning Rod is making his move.
He's gaining gradually from the inside.
Cayenne Pepper has broken stride.
Lightning Rod's alongside to (mumbles) and he's taking the lead.
Come on, come on!
Shut up!
Come on!
You shut up!
Hey, what's that fool up to?
Hey!
Hold him back, Sam!
I can't help it, he's going too fast!
Hey, you're going too fast!
[Announcer] (mumbles) is fighting back.
With Lightning Rod...
Hey boss, I took a bet on that horse for 11 to one odds.
11 to one?
You jerk, Bugsy!
What are you picking on me for?
It was you said Lightning Rod was going to get beat.
But look!
[Announcer] Home stretch it's still lightning rod with (mumbles) fighting all the way.
But Lightning Rod isn't taking any chances.
And as they past the post...
Hey!
(cheering)
Go to the house of that dumb bastard Sam Stallion, you know what to do.
And if he ain't there then give it to his baby.
Understand?
Let's go.
Now what were the odds you said you gave on Lightning Rod?
11 to one.
(slapping)
One, two, three, four, five, six...
You heard what the boss said about if he's not there.
And the boss's orders are the boss's orders.
You go up and get the baby.
Hey George, there's something here that ain't quite kosher.
Stop being a turkey.
Throw the kid out the window and let's get out of here.
You ever picked up a kid before?
Ready?
Coochie coochie coo.
Hey George, doesn't that kid look like someone we know?
All babies look alike.
(hitting) (crying out)
(splashing)
Next time pick on a kid your own side.
Got that?
(mariachi music)
Head for the royal flush.
Then comes four of a kind.
Then a full house, three of a kind, two pair, and a pair.
You remember where the ordinary flush and straight go, right?
Now what's that?
Four of a kind.
Hey, that's a pretty good hand.
In more ways than one.
What else, master?
Then you got IF.
I never heard of that.
The luck factor.
When lady luck decides you're high on a list and you ain't a bad player, nobody can beat you.
Let me see now.
In American poker using all 52 cards with no jokers, you've got one point 75 probabilities in a million of coming up with the royal flush.
Three point 75 four of a kind, 11 point nine for a straight.
64 for a full house, 186 for three of a kind.
275 for a pair, but none of it is of any use unless you've got the IF.
How's that, Mr. Firpo?
Arithmetic ain't my strong point.
Let's see your money, boys.
Here's two tens.
Ah baby come to daddy.
Hey Mike Firpo.
You seem pretty happy.
You see that?
I won!
Yeah but you're playing in our territory.
Go on.
Hey, your blind stuff won't work with me.
Now we told you to keep out of here.
Well yeah.
(hits)
(shouting)
I'll raise you two bananas.
Hey.
That's Papi.
Oh come on, that's impossible.
Well take a look, there he goes!
There he goes!
(crying out)
He's gotta be down here, I know I saw him.
Let's take a look.
But I think you're nuts, Charlie.
I don't see him, but I know I saw him.
Come on Charlie, I've still got a lot to learn.
Gosh darnit I tell you I'm sure I saw him.
Let's go back upstairs, huh?
Come here, come here!
Now who were you running after?
You were running after our papi.
Come on, knock it off.
You know our father's blind.
Don't go telling me the old coot's... (slapping)
Whatever you're doing that'll teach you not to do it, huh?
Right Charlie?
Oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
Listen blue eyes, if you and Papi are putting me on,
I'll smash your face.
Go on, why don't you say what you really mean?
That you don't believe your own flesh and blood?
Your own,
(fly buzzing) your own father.
Give you your most precious gift, your existence.
And you don't even believe me.
Your own brother!
Was trying to help you find a purpose!
Your aimless, empty, wasted life!
(sneezing)
See he really made me catch a cold.
Are you happy now?
Well, I...
That's okay.
Let's just keep our minds on how we can make the money we need, come on, Charlie.
I know there's so much more you can teach me.
Let's go back upstairs and start all over again, okay?
Sweat blood to put this little stake together.
Now we're gonna use it.
You take it and bet it all on the guy I told you too.
Sure okay, Charlie.
I'll see ya.
Okay, let's go.
Hey, where's the famous Jai Alai world champion?
Jamon Serrano?
Charlie Firpo?
Hey, amigo!
Hola amigo mio.
Hey, caught you with your girdle off, eh?
Ah, don't make fun of me, I'm not what I once was when you and I played together.
Look what I have to do to look younger.
Ah, you look terrific.
I know.
To tell the truth I can hardly follow the ball anymore, it's kind of embarrassing.
But it's not all my fault.
Had plebitus in the leg here, touch of arthritis.
Arthritis?
Here, tell me the good news over one of these.
I think tonight'll be my last match.
They hire me because I'm a clown.
But the time has come to give it up.
No more pelota, getting too old.
Don't give me that.
Tomorrow all the papers'll be talking about you just like in the good old days.
How I wish.
But the bookies are giving 10 to one odds, you know what that means.
Would you believe my brother's betting $50,000 on you?
$50,000?
Your brother's loco, you better get him to the nut house right away.
Yeah, I know, he's been that way for years.
I'm the guy they gotta watch.
Would you please make an offering for the orphans?
Thank you very much.
Would you please, an offering please?
Will you make a donation please?
Hey.
Fine, I'm coming.
Go inside.
Hey there.
Want a candy?
Hey, rough stuff.
I'm really glad to see you again.
I'm glad to see you too.
By the way, thanks for the tip you gave me at the race track, remember?
I do the same for all my friends.
Hey those guys over there are your friends, huh?
Not in the sense you mean.
I belong to me.
You'd be the only one I could really go for.
Oh really?
I'll remember that.
What are the odds on Jamon Serrano?
10 to one.
Well, I'm gonna put the whole wad on him, $50,000.
Are you crazy?
Jamon Serrano's finished, he's run down.
Nobody bets on him.
Nynfus and the gang are giving those odds 'cause they know he won't win.
Well I like risks.
Ha ha.
Hey, remember me?
Hey, wanna place a bet?
Yes sir.
One minute to game time, take your seats, ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're coming up to the last match of this evening's main event.
Players are on the court.
And in first post we have number 24, Arrina Padilla.
Post two, number 32, Mendez Killer Jose.
Post four, number 50, Ruez El Toto.
Post five, number 42, Salazar.
Post six, number 45, Primero.
Post seven, Gonzalez.
And at post three, Ramon Jamon Serrano, just as colorful as always.
Post eight, number 51, Luis Del Rey.
There you are ladies and gentlemen, let's start the match.
The first encounter is between Arrina in red and Mendez in light blue.
In this particular contest, the individual player gains points by outplaying and eliminating his opponent.
And the first match has begun.
Players must throw the ball, or pelota, in such a way that his opponent cannot return.
And there you have it, Arrina is the loser.
Now, Mendez must face Ramon Jamon Serrano in the white jersey.
(ball clacking)
Terrific throw by the veteran Serrano eliminates Mendez.
In spite of his courageous attempt to recover the ball.
Now out on the court comes Ruez El Toto.
As you may know, the ball can bounce off the end and side walls, but can only bounce once on the floor before it must be returned by the opposing player.
(applause)
After a fine volley, Ruez fails to return the ball.
Number three wins again.
He now has two points and it's one time world champion
Salazar, he gets the ball off the wall and returns it at high speed, but Serrano curls it back into play.
Salazar goes up on the wall again but loses his balance.
Outclassed.
Serrano now has won three games, he faces Carlo Primero.
Primero goes up but can't reach high enough and Jamon Serrano wins his fourth straight game.
Now it's Gonzalez's turn to try and stop this amazing winning streak.
(applause)
Serrano continues to win and now has five points.
He must now face Luis Del Rey.
This is sensational!
Ramon Serrano, the Jamon, has proved he can still win!
He's done it!
He's won the match!
He is the new champion!
Jamon!
Bravo!
Hey hey!
[Announcer] But tonight he has come back to beat some of the world's best players.
So Serrano ain't worth a dime but with his (mumbles), his beer drinking, his slipped disk.
But you Bugsy, you're a jerk, a numbskull, you got a pea brain Bugsy.
The wager's gonna cost a half a million dollars.
And who's gonna break the news to The Greek?
I will.
Just take me to his place and I'll be glad to tell him.
I'll put up $500,000 you owe me for this match in a poker game, but I only want to play with him.
Paragoulis The Greek.
Huh?
Hey listen boss.
You know, this guy's a real nerd at cards.
Remember when we played with him before?
He lost his shirt.
Believe me, against The Greek he won't even have a chance at winning.
He's right you know.
The boss'll take him to the cleaners and he'll lose it all anyway.
It's a deal.
Consider yourself invited to The Greek's.
For a friendly little family game, alright?
Would you mind giving me the money first?
Pay him.
$100,000.
200, 300, 400, 500.
Everything is going as planned.
Lieutenant Firpo is close to pinpointing the location of The Greek, the man we've been after, thanks to the help he's had from his father, Mike Firpo.
Admiral, as you requested, we arranged to have the police drop the charges against Firpo's father.
They were after him for everything from bouncing bad checks to raising mayhem.
Raising mayhem?
I thought you got a medal for that.
(phone ringing)
Admiral O'Connor.
Hello?
I'm calling for Johnny Firpo.
He said to tell you that he's on his way to the place he has been looking for and that you should follow him as you had arranged to.
No, that's all he said.
You're welcome.
Hiya Sister.
Oh, hello Charlie.
You seen my brother around here?
Oh yes, he said to say hello to you.
He won a lot of money.
He gave me enough for...
Hey what are you doing?
Put that (nervous laughter).
Anything else?
Oh yes, he also said to give you this note.
[Johnny Voiceover] How are you, Charlie?
I'm gonna put up all the money we won in a poker game since you're my master.
I bet I beat the pants off The Greek.
You and Papi and Sister Suzanne and the orphans too, huh?
Please root for me?
Thanks.
Yours forever, your brother.
PS, don't get mad, huh?
Good news?
Very bad news.
He's alive.
But?
This way, we're taking a boat ride.
Where we going?
Didn't you tell me you wanted to play with Paragoulis?
Well let's go.
There's still time.
For what?
To pull out.
I'll jump in the water, you jump into save me, we'll swim back to shore and then you beat it.
What do we have to do all that for?
'Cause I don't want you ruined.
I saw how you play, like a baby.
Paragoulis is the biggest card shark around.
Listen to me, rough stuff, just keep your money and beat it.
Your plan wouldn't work, baby.
But I like the part about the mouth to mouth resuscitation to save your life.
Well, no need for that.
Hey, what are those two doing?
Bugsy, you know what you are?
Yeah, I'm a jerk.
(funky music)
Hey, looks like we got a big bird in the sky for an escort.
(laughing)
Navy command, navy command, this is condor eight zero two zero, calling navy command.
Admiral, the launch is going outside territorial waters.
So it's impossible to pursue any further.
Damnit.
Now we can't intervene.
The launch has gone outside territorial waters.
That means Lieutenant Firpo will find himself alone without help in the hands of the underworld somewhere at sea.
Our whole plan will fail.
You listen to me, friend.
Never trust people that got blue eyes.
Never.
Especially if they your brother.
Get on the line.
They got here.
(funky music)
(chattering)
Nice place, huh?
After you.
And we have 24, black, even.
Sorry about that ma'am.
I'd like to play just black this time.
Okay.
Let's stay here for a minute, please.
There you are, sir.
Two was the last number, right?
Yes, two was the last number.
Right.
That's 100 on 11 please.
One two three four five.
Okay, $10,000 on the nine.
The (mumbles) and dust.
$3,000 on the column (mumbles) and $2,000 on red.
Watch this guy, he's really something.
No more bets please.
Here we go.
And we have a nine!
Not bad, eh?
I'm a wizard in infinitesimal calculus.
I just worked out the probabilities.
Thanks ma'am.
What number should I play now?
Please advise me.
Well you have to wait for your mathematical probability to come around again.
And with this wheel it'll be in 90,822 turns.
What do you mean I have to wait that long?
Just have to be patient.
This the creep who won all that money which you guys owe to me?
Yeah, that's him.
He's trying to bankrupt us.
He won a half million at pelota and now 154,000 in one go at roulette.
On board my boat no one is allowed to get away with that.
Some way he must be made to understand that winning will be very bad for his health.
I've been doing some thinking, boss.
You know that guy is real lucky when it comes to picking winners.
But when it comes to playing poker he's a babe in arms.
While you are the sharpest in the whole world.
And in outer space.
[Nynfus] In the whole universe, boss.
Okay, we clip his wings in poker.
Call him.
Nice truck.
I had a truck once too.
Nice truck.
But my brother stole it.
My brother stole my truck.
Your brother took your truck?
Yep.
You're lucky.
My brother took my wife.
I'm glad to make your acquaintance, Johnny Firpo.
That is your name, isn't it?
A name that's not completely new to me.
Not as new as that nose of yours that my brother Charlie rearranged for you.
So you're Charlie Firpo's brother?
You bet.
He's strong with cards and tough with his fists.
(chuckles)
But they tell me you're better at cards.
That right?
Well I have learned to play the game, Mr. Paragoulis.
Well now we'll see.
Cut.
A grand.
A full pot makes me hot.
I hate smart remarks when I play poker, they make me very nervous.
Me too.
I'm in.
How many?
The pot's still light.
(snaps)
Three cards.
The same.
One.
Take three.
Anybody want a bite?
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
It's a six, I can do it with my eyes closed.
See that?
(laughing)
Now I will show you Firpo's most famous shot.
Known as the Firpo double whammy which succeeds only one time in a hundred
and I'm gonna do it backwards.
(laughing)
Charlie!
I can see you!
Charlie!
I can see you!
Yes!
It's a miracle!
It's a miracle, Charlie!
A miracle, eh?
A miracle!
(smashing)
(clamoring)
Hey man, what are you doing to my place?
Shut up.
It was a favor for Johnny.
(shouting)
(crashing)
I've had enough!
Charlie, what are you doing?
I was happy driving my truck.
Go find blue eyes.
Straight.
Ah shit.
I'd sure like to know how the hell you managed to win all the time.
I got a whole orphanage praying for me.
10.
No shame in a friendly game.
Just stop with the wisecracks, they're not funny and we're not amused.
Me neither, me neither.
[Bugsy] How many cards?
Four.
Three.
Two.
And the dealer takes three.
Two grand.
I'll raise you double.
I'm out.
Double again.
Ah, alright.
I'll see you.
Full house.
(laughing)
Ah, good hand.
Excuse me, excuse me.
I've got a five, a six, a seven, an eight, and a nine.
All hearts.
I guess that beats a full house, huh?
Right?
I don't believe it.
You took four cards, how did you do it?
Don't ask me, ask the orphans.
Let's play again.
Okay.
Cut.
Well, what are we gonna play for?
I put up the boat, the casino, and everything that goes with it.
But first, you'll have to excuse me for a double P.
What's that?
A double P.
Pee pee.
I'll be back in a flash.
Excuse me.
Would you hold this please?
Thank you.
There you go.
You know it's not that I don't trust you folks.
I always do this.
Thank you.
Oh.
Hey, where is everybody?
Sleeping.
Already?
Yeah.
Hey!
Thank you.
Gonna wait for me?
Wouldn't want you to get lost.
(squeaking)
(slams)
Oh, did you want to come in?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hey, what's going on?
Aren't you guys gonna play?
[Paragoulis] No, Johnny Firpo.
Why not?
'Cause now it's just between us two.
One to one, face to face.
And we're gonna play five card stud, alright?
Sure, that's fine with me.
Get out.
Good luck.
Thanks, baby.
Should we put a value on this old tub?
This old tub cost me more than a million dollars.
You got ripped off.
I've always had a pretty good nose for a deal.
Maybe, before you met my brother.
Let's say it's worth half a million.
The top on the first card, you won't have much left for the others.
(laughing)
Hey!
When I give you the signal, cut me loose!
[Mike] Alright my boy, but be careful!
Your pants.
What?
Your pants.
You're bluffing.
You can't be serious.
You've got to be bluffing.
If you want to see you got to pay and you're short $3,000.
And $3,000 for a pair of pants is not a bad deal.
What else have you got?
The upper hand.
Ho ho ho.
Let me see.
That's not enough.
This isn't worth more than $300.
Come on, come on, your pants.
What are you guys waiting for?
Throw him to the sharks!
Hey, hold it, hold it, take it easy, guys.
Let's not get uptight about a little game between friends.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Paragoulis.
What if we do it this way?
You take me to shore on this nice beautiful boat and you can have it all back.
It's all yours, here, it's all yours, Mr. Paragoulis.
First I want to see if you were bluffing.
Push the joker in the water.
Geronimo!
(crashing)
Hey, look who's here!
Charlie's here.
Shut up.
Peace.
What a nice surprise!
Did you come to gamble?
I come to get a pair of blue eyes for our papi.
Great punch.
Charlie.
(chuckles)
(punches)
(chuckles)
Johnny.
Now take it easy Charlie, calm down.
I know when you're nervous it's hard for you to understand but let me explain, I can explain everything.
(punches)
Charlie, remember when we were kids, united we'd stand and divided we'd fall?
And remember how together we used to beat everybody, right?
Huh?
(punches)
Oh gosh, I'm sorry, don't get mad.
(punches)
Not again, poor guy.
It's just not my day.
Hey buddy.
Yeah?
Are you fighting yourselves or against us?
You didn't get it yet?
No.
I'll explain it to you.
Good.
(punching) (grunting)
(cheery music)
It's your lucky night.
One for you, one for you.
Hey, buzz off.
My hand slipped.
Hey I want to show you something.
Hey, come up to the bar, it's on me.
(smashing)
Hey, what do you want?
Coke.
This okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
Hey, slim, you keeping your nails clean?
Don't worry, I'm not going to use this.
Look.
Let's see.
(cries out)
Oh, that smarts.
You want a hit?
Yes please.
Thank you very much.
(smashes)
Hey Greek, wait a minute.
Forgot this.
Learned your lessons, have you?
Nothing like working together, huh?
Yeah, behind you.
Hey.
(punching)
Watch out.
You'd think they'd have learned, wouldn't you?
Why don't you hit him?
That one?
Let's get 'em all up.
Nice going.
Hey, Nynfus, come here.
Yeah sure, sure.
Now the joker's on the table.
Folks will you look at that, forgot one.
Hold on friend, help is on its way.
You'll never get the boat to land.
Who says?
(punches)
He's right, we gotta find a way to get this tub back to land.
Huh.
No we don't.
(sirens wailing)
Okay men, get them on their feet and get them out of here.
Hey, how'd you do that?
Simple.
(dolphins squeaking)
Actually it was them, I only told them what to do.
(squeaking)
What were you guys talking about?
Why don't you learn how to speak dolphinese?
It comes in handy on occasions like this.
I also speak turtlese, crocodilese, hippopotomese.
[Pupa] Hey rough stuff.
Oh hey.
Hi.
Hey yourself.
Here's a souvenir.
Thanks.
Come see me in the clink?
I don't have to do that.
I'm gonna pay your bail and take you out to dinner tonight.
What do you say, huh?
That sounds even better.
Johnny.
See you later.
My boys!
Johnny!
And Charlie!
I'm proud of you.
Admiral, I hope you keep your promise.
Admirals always keep their promises.
And I wanna make one thing clear.
This mission would not have been successful without the help of your son Charlie Firpo to whom the United States Navy wishes to offer a brand new truck.
And it's got the works.
CB radio, automatic shift, radial tires, you name it.
As for your other son, there'll be a decoration.
Congratulations, Lieutenant Firpo.
What's this, Lieutenant Firpo?
You putting me on?
No, not this time, Charlie.
Admiral, I'd like to make a last bet with my brother, sir.
A bet?
Gentlemen, what do you say we look over this ship?
Okay.
Let's make the bet of a lifetime.
We got a cool million dollars between us, all from gambling.
What do you say we flip for it?
Heads or tails?
Boys, boys, what about me?
What about me?
What about your poor old father who loves you so?
Don't worry, don't worry papi.
I'll decide how we do this.
Heads it's all for you, okay?
Uh huh.
Tails it's half for Papi, half for me.
If it's neither heads or tails, it all goes to Sister Suzanne and the orphanage.
Deal.
Papi, you flip it.
Like you used to do on the beach when we were kids.
Okay boys.
(cawing)
You see that?
Neither heads nor tails, it all goes to the orphanage.
How did you do that?
You know what that was?
Jonathan Livingston Firpo.

WET LIPS (aka COCKTAIL SPECIAL)
- Hello.
- How are you, Eugenie?
- Is that you, Martine?
- Yes.
I wanted to hear your sweet voice.
You're so kind.
You know, I like you very much.
And I want to see you again.
- But I...
that's very nice!
It will get even nicer.
What're you doing in the next few days?
I don't know yet.
Would you like to spend the weekend at my place?
I'd love that.
We still have to discuss several things.
I like you very much.
When we met the second time, you asked me certain delicate questions.
You admitted to being completely uninformed about sex.
And you wanted me to be your guide in this field, so to speak.
Yes.
It's always flattering for a writer to guide a girl as fascinating like you.
I've noticed that you're interested in my novels and maybe they even excite you a little?
Yes.
You know, I'm just as exicted, I can't get you out of my mind.
Yes, my angel.
Through my books I've become...
A lesbian.
I know that.
And I believe I'm one too.
When you come this weekend, I'll introduce all these pleasures to you, the most refined, exiciting.
- Yes.
I'd like to.
I'm really excited by the idea, but...
But you're afraid to come, right?
Yes.
Of course, I'd also love to, but...
So, you'll come?
I don't know what my parents would say...
Talk to them.
You have to come.
I want you.
At nights I can't sleep anymore.
I dream of you, of your body.
I can't forget it.
Do you believe me?
- Yes.
If you want...
I could speak with your father.
You must come.
- Yes!
- Come, darling.
I'll welcome you with my friends and servants.
Everyone wants to meet you.
I'm not alone right now.
I've Berto's penis in my hand.
While his wife licks me from behind.
But you're the one that truly excites me.
Imagine having in your hands what I have.
Feel blood pulsing.
Imagine it's you feeling the tongue at your anus.
It also touches the vulvar.
It's fantastic!
It's getting bigger and harder!
My brother Christian is here with us too.
In my bed.
Shy and inexperienced as he is.
I want him to see you.
Come!
We're all waiting!
Have a marvellous weekend with us.
I masturbated.
- Thinking of me?
I'm thinking of you all the time.
I'll call you again tonight.
I hear my parent's car coming.
We'll talk tonight, alright?
She's coming, Christian.
Who was that on the phone?
A friend of mine.
Why are you walking around nude?
Why?
We're family, daddy.
No, first of all I'm a man.
- You're my father.
I don't want to see you nude again!
Come here!
- Yes, right away.
The judgement?
You've been bad to your friend and you need to be punished.
Yes, certainly.
Thank you.
You can't expect me... to do that.
No!
I won't do something like that...
I don't want it.
Why not?
I'll invite your daughter for the weekend to meet my little brother, nothing serious.
- They'll only play with each other.
- No, not with Eugenie.
Would you like to be the hero of my new book?
Raymond Raspe, the respectable politician, unmasked.
He's just a little masochist.
You won't do this!
- I do whatever I want to.
So then, she will come.
What do you want from her?
What do you want?
She's still a child.
I had always sought pleasure without ever finding it, without arriving at true pleasure.
But that night, I was blessed with luck and discovered all my senses.
My mouth sought my brother's sex and while I took it between my lips.
and he was touching my breasts,
I felt how it grew... how it hardened...
My brother Christian was just 14... but his penis became bigger and bigger between my lips which moved up and down.
My tender, wet tongue caressed the reddish, soft crest of the young penis.
He exploded and the semen splashed into my mouth.
Christian was shocked and pulled out his sex.
A new outpour touched my belly, my legs and my lap.
I swallowed the warm liquid, a little spicy, a little bitter, delicious.
I had a neverending orgasm.
Magnificent!
I begged him to take care of my sex and he kissed me on the mouth which was delicious as well.
And then between my legs.
Martine!
Hello?
- Good evening, my love.
Is it you, Martine?
Yes, my angel, with good news.
Your father has nothing against your coming here.
Are you happy?
Oh yes... it's really fantastic.
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning then.
I'm very happy!
See you tomorrow!
Thanks Martine.
- Sleep well.
Where is Eugenie going?
And with whom?
I gave her permission.
Come here.
What's wrong?
- I'm worried about her.
There's no need.
She's spending the weekend with a famous novelist.
You could have told me.
I want to introduce you.
This is Eugenie.
Good morning.
- Hello.
Berto and Anna will show you the room.
- Of course.
They're my most faithful servants.
Show Eugenie to her room.
- Gladly!
Are you coming?
This is your room.
It's really nice.
Nicer than mine at home.
Berto, could you fill the bathtub?
I'm afraid...
I'm afraid of women.
Why... it was magnificent.
Eugenie is a sweet girl.
You don't need to be afraid.
- I love you.
She's probably still a virgin.
Her hands are as soft as silk.
She'll satisfy you, dear brother.
Come!
Let's unbotton your blouse.
The trousers.
You have beautiful skin.
I like that!
- You do?
- Yes!
What are you doing?
Berto!
Berto, come here.
Berto, don't frighten the girl.
You need to proceed with caution.
Do you understand?
- Sure.
You're really pretty, Eugenie.
- Thank you, Martine
Anna, make a special cocktail.
Do you like the cocktail?
- Yes.
Did you recognise all the ingredients?
- No.
It's nice that you liked it.
Soon, you'll taste things you'll like even more.
Hello, Eugenie.
- Hi.
My name is Sandra.
And I'm Carlo.
Relax, Eugenie.
Let us do everything, dear.
Just let yourself go.
- Are you starting to feel the desire?
- Yes.
The most important thing is to give in to the pleasure.
It's much better than actually making love.
Uninhibitedly experiencing pleasure without restraint, without taboos.
Let your imagination run wild.
Be ready to experience pleasure.
Now let's daw lots to decide who will do what.
Sandra will lick Martine's and Anna's asses.
Now, Anna's mouth and Berto's penis will show us a unique fight of resistance.
My dear sister Martine will be fucked by Carlo.
Oh, no!
Let me go!
I don't want to!
Martine!
Martine!
Martine, come!
Martine!
Finally!
Here I am my darling.
I love you, Martine.
Keep going!
Why don't you keep going?
Come on.
Come!
D'you want to join us?
Good morning, girls, Hello Martine!
I'm Johan.
I'm going for a walk.
Who'd like to come with us?
Me!
No!
Yes!
We just want to see that you're a man!
- I don't want to!
Let go of me!
Who will make the first dive?
This is your big night, Eugenie.
And your last one.
At this masquerade ball, nobody knows what mask the others have chosen.
Choose yours so we can start.
But you mustn't be recognized by anyone.
Good evening, sir.
Are you alone?
Where's my daughter.
- Eugenie?
She left a while ago.
Our party wasn't to her taste.
Won't you stay with us?
- No, thank you.
Really?
You can disguise yourself.
No one will recognize you.
I'll offer you the most beautiful woman here.
You can feed all your desires.
This is the most interesting man I invited.
I offer him to you.
It's midnight.
Take off your masks.
Eugenie... it's you!
- Daddy!
Daddy!
Oh daddy!
- Eugenie!
My god!
She's a good student.
- No wonder, with a teacher like you.

WET LIPS (aka COCKTAIL SPECIAL)
- Hello
- How are you, Eugenie?
- Is that you, Martine?
- Yes
- I wanted to hear your sweet voice.
- You're so kind.
I called because I want to see you again.
That's really great.
It could be even better.
What are you doing in the next few days?
I still don't know.
Would you like to spend the weekend at my place?
Sure!
Why not.
I like the idea.
First we'll have to settle a couple of things.
If you say so.
The last time we saw each other, we had a delicate conversation.
You admitted to being completely uninformed about sex.
You wanted me to bring you
- into this scene, so to speak.
- Yes.
For a writer, it's an honor to be a guide for a fascinating girl like you.
Thanks.
Do you read my books because they excite you?
Yes.
You get excited reading my books and I get excited thinking about you.
- Really?
- Yes, my angel.
Lately I've become a bit lesbian.
I can imagine.
And maybe I am a bit too.
When you come, you'll meet my friends and learn their specialities.
I confess the idea appeals to me.
What's wrong?
You're afraid of trying new things, right?
Yes
But, at the same time, I want to experience them.
- So, you'll come?
- I don't know.
- What would I say to my parents?
- Talk to them.
You have to come.
I want you.
At nights I can't sleep anymore.
I always think of you.
I dream of your body.
I dream of kissing you.
If you want...
I could speak with your father.
Yes.
- You have to come.
- I'll come soon.
Come, dear, I'll happily wait for you with my friends and servants.
Everyone wants to meet you.
You know, I'm not alone right now.
I'm playing with Berto.
- While his wife licks me.
- Yes.
But you're the one that truly excites me.
Come.
Imagine having in your hands what I have.
Feel the blood pulsing.
Imagine feeling Anna's tongue licking you everywhere... touching you.
It's fantastic!
Yes.
It's getting harder, bigger.
My brother Christian is here with us.
In my bed.
Who is experienced with me.
I want him to see you, so come.
Come, Eugenie.
All of us are waiting for you to join us for a nice weekend.
I touched myself.
Thinking of me?
Yes, of you and the things you told me.
- I'll call you again tonight.
- Bye, Martine.
Who was that on the phone?
A friend of mine.
Why do you wander around nude?
Aren't you ashamed?
We're a family, daddy.
So what, I'm a man - got it?
You're my father.
I don't want to see you nude.
Is that clear?
Come here... closer.
Yes, right away.
The judgement?
You've been bad to your friend and you need to be punished.
Yes, certainly.
Thank you.
You can't expect this from me.
Something like that I won't do...
I don't want to.
Why not?
I only want to invite your daughter over.
to meet my little brother, that's it.
They'll only play with each other.
No
Would you like to be the hero of my new book?
Raymond Raspe, public politician... finally removing his mask... is only a little masochist.
You can't do this... no.
I do everything I want to.
So, she will come?
What do you want from her?
She's still a kid.
I had always enjoyed so much
But without arriving at the true pleasure.
But finally, that night
I discovered all my senses.
My mouth sought my brother's orgasm.
While I took him between my lips...
I felt how it grew...
how it hardened.
My brother Christian was just 14... but his organ became bigger and bigger between my lips... while my tender, delicate tongue... maneuvered unyieldingly.
It exploded and that was the first time
I had a neverending orgasm.
Stupendous.
I begged him to feel safe with me.
He kissed me on the mouth and then between the legs.
Martine!
Martine!
- Hello.
- Good evening, my love.
It's you, Martine.
Yes, my angel, with good news.
Your father has nothing against your coming here.
Are you happy?
Oh, Martine, it's really fantastic.
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning then.
- Thanks Martine.
- Sleep well.
Where is Eugenie going?
- I gave her permission.
- But with who?
What's the difference?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
- I'm worried about her.
- There's no need.
She's passing the weekend with a famous author of novels.
You could have at least told me about it first.
I want to introduce you...
This is Eugenie.
- Good morning.
- Hello.
- Show her to her room.
- OK.
They're my best housekeepers.
Accompany Eugenie to her room.
You'll sleep here.
It's really nice.
Berto, could you fill the bathtub?
OK
I'm afraid...
I'm afraid of women.
Why?
It was stupendous.
Eugenie is a sweet girl, very sweet.
Don't be afraid.
I love you.
She's definitely still a virgin.
Her hands are as soft as silk.
She'll make you happy, little brother.
What are you doing?
Berto!
Berto, come here.
No, don't touch me.
I don't want to.
Berto.
Berto!
Don't frighten the little ones, understand?
OK.
- You need to proceed with caution.
- OK.
You can't be in a hurry.
Good evening, my love.
You know Eugenie, you're really pretty.
Anna, make a special cocktail.
Do you like the cocktail?
Very much.
- Did you recognise all the ingredients?
- No.
It's nice that you liked it, you know.
Soon, you'll taste things you'll like even more.
- Hi Eugenie.
- Hi.
My name is Sandra.
And I'm Carlo.
Relax, Eugenie.
Relax, c'mon.
Let us do everything, dear, you need only relax.
- You're starting to like the feeling?
- Yes.
The most important thing is to release yourself to the pleasure.
Attain the heights of love.
Experience pleasure without reserve, without restraint, without taboo.
Let your imagination run wild, be ready to experience pleasure.
Now we'll draw lots.
It's time to decide which of you will do it.
Sandra...
Sandra will lick Martine and Anna.
Now, Berto will give us an example of exceptional endurance.
My dear sister will be fucked by Carlo.
Hold her tight.
No!
Leave me alone!
No!
No!
I don't want to!
Martine!
Martine!
Come...
Come.
Martine.
Martine, finally!
Come here, Martine.
Come here.
I love you, Martine.
Why don't you keep going?
C'mon.
Don't you want to hang out with us?
Aha!
Good morning you lovely girls!
Hello, Martine.
I'm Jovan, and I'd like to go for a walk with one of you ladies.
Who's coming?
Me!
Come here a sec, Christian.
We only want to see if you're a man.
- C'mon
- No!
- C'mon
- Wait!
No!
Wait!
I beg you!
Leave me alone!
That's enough!
C'mon!
This is your big night, Eugenie.
Take advantage of it.
In this masquerade ball, nobody knows what mask the others have chosen.
Choose yours and join them.
You won't be recognized by anyone.
Good evening, sir.
Are you alone?
I want my daughter.
Eugenie?
She left a while ago.
- Our party wasn't to her taste.
- Where did she go?
Don't you want to stay with us?
I really want you to.
You don't want to join our party?
You can disguise yourself.
No one will recognize you.
I'll offer you the most beautiful woman.
- I don't have time to lose.
- Come on, don't make me beg.
Is she at least sweet?
Yes... so you'll stay?
Come.
I offer you... the most interesting man I've invited.
Just like you
It's midnight.
Take off your masks.
Eugenie... it's you!
Daddy!
She's a good student.
A marvel, with a teacher like you.
subtitled by Sophia0429 for Cinemageddon
All right.
Spread out.
Spread out.
Ferguson, Rich!
Don't sit on top of each other.
You know, Rich, if we were in a telephone booth... the sarge'd still tell us to spread out.
[ Man ] So take a couple giant steps, Fergy.
- [ Incoming Shells ]
- Incoming!
Hit the dirt!
[ Men Shouting ]
- [ Machine Gun Firing ] - [ Man ] Rich.!
- [ Man Coughing ]
- Rich,you okay?
[ Shouting Continues ]
[ Man Gagging ]
Medic!
Medic!
Don't try and talk, Rich.
You're hit there.
Medic!
Damn it, Medic!
Easy, Rich.
Easy.
- Where you been?
- What have we got?
He took some stuff in his neck.
He's bleeding.
Okay.
Take it easy.
Litter!
You're gonna be all right, fella.
We'll get you out of here.
Let's get him out.
Hold his head.
Okay.
Move.
Things'll bounce a bit, so hold on.
Let's go!
- Okay, let's lift him.
- [ Man ] Got him.
Go, go, go.!
[ Men Chattering ]
They'll fix you up at MASH.
Don't you worry.
- All right.!
Let's move it out.!
- You're on your way now, Rich.
First-class seat on one of them choppers.
- Keep in touch, eh, punk?
- Let's go!
See you sometime.
Low bridge!
Watch out!
I need a pair of hands here.
How ya doin', partner?
You got a reservation?
- Okay, sir.
I'll take this end.
- pretty big guy, Radar.
That's okay.Just don't take any of those giant steps of yours.
All right.
One, two, three, up.!
- Oh.!
You got it?
- Holy cow!
- Let's go, people.
Move it, move it, move it!
- I'm moving, sir!
- What are you two, out for a stroll?
- Sir, he kinda weighs a ton.
I don't care what he weighs.
Just pick up the damn pace!
Klinger, come on.
Give me some help here.
[ BJ.] He certainly got up on the wrong side of the bedlam.
One beast of burden coming up.
Okay.
Okay, pal.
Take it easy.
Have a nice ride down.
Enjoy the view.
- We'll leave the top down.
- All aboard the Toledo Express!
Nonstop to pre-op at a lightning speed of five miles an hour.
- He's just kidding.
- Ah, come on!
- Come on!
- [ Engine Starts ]
It works!
See?
I told you.
Not a thing to worry about.
Oh, hi.
I'm Corporal O'Reilly, the company clerk.
They call me Radar.
Only that's not my real name.
They just use it like it was.
Uh, listen, if it's okay with you, I gotta take your valuables here.
But don't worry about 'em.
They'll be in a real safe safe.
Only me and Colonel Potter know the combination.
Oh, I think Major Houlihan knows it too.
And I think maybe Captain Pierce, and he probably told Captain Hunnicutt.
But don't worry about it, 'cause you can trust us all.
Yeah.
Okay, we're almost there.
Well, listen.Just relax.
The surgeons here are the best.
I mean, the best.
They're really special guys.
Okay, come on!
We need some help here!
I'd look up to 'em even if I was tall.
Am I talking too much?
Okay.
Now, I know everybody's tellin' ya that you're gonna be okay, but you're really gonna.
So just relax.
Move him out now.
Let's go!
[ Radar ] Easy.
Okay.
He's got a throat injury there.
[ O.R. Chatter]
[ Man ] Okay, keep 'em comin'.
Keep 'em comin'.
Hold tight.
Doctor'll be along in a second.
Working as fast as we can.
It'll bejust a few more minutes.
Hey, lamb chop.
Hey,you.
Tall, blonde, and...
hubba-hubba.
- Is there something I can do for you?
- Let me count the ways.
- You're wounded, Private.
- Right in the heart.
They're such leches, bless 'em.
Klinger, you clown!
How many times have I told you... not to wear that flowing stuff in here?
I never wear this during the day, sir, but, I don't know, I had a whim.
Then ""whim" it off and get into fatigues!
I'm tired of lookin' at ya.
- Then please, fire me.
- Move!
- Moving, sir.
Moving.
- [ Fabric Tears ]
Hey.
Rich.
Rich, is that you?
Hiya, buddy!
Well, the sarge warned us to spread out, didn't he, huh?
- Well, how ya doin'?
- [ Coughing ]
You don't have to talk.
I got it in the leg... and boy, did it hurt for a while... but they gave me a shot.
- It don't look too bad, huh?
- No, no.
The whole blood is over here for him.
Bring a unit for me.
Straight up.
No ice.
Hi, there.
I'm Captain Pierce.
What do you think of me so far?
Okay, now just relax.
I only want to look under your bandage.
Army regulations.
You could be hiding a jeep.
- Hey, Beej?
- Yeah.
You got a second?
Come here.
Take a look at this.
Oh, yeah.
We've already met.
I pulled him off the chopper.
Step into my office.
Don't worry.
We really are doctors.
- [ Indistinct Chatter] - [ Coughing ]
Ah!
Right!
We were talking about you.
Okay, what I have to do is get the shrapnel out of your neck.
Then I'm gonna put a tube in so you can breathe easier.
If you want to brag about this to the folks at home, it's called a tracheostomy.
And after the swelling goes down, your-- your voice should come back.
I know what you're thinking--
""This guy looks like he couldn't even fix a bicycle tire."
Well, I can't, but I'm gonna get you through this.
You wait and see.
Hello.
Private Rich.
I'm Father Mulcahy.
I'll be your spiritual leader for the next few days.
I see you're a Protestant.
Well, no problem.
I'm familiar with the procedures of most of the current denominations... although I'm a little inhibited when it comes to the Southern Baptist service.
It's so frenetic and forceful.
Bit of a stretch for me... but then, that's my problem.
Well,just close your eyes, rest easy... and remember, He's watching over you.
and remember, He's watching over you.
Hey, fellow, we're gonna take a quick X-ray.
What's your good side?
Makes no difference.
This camera sees right through you.
Raise your head, please.
You know, as much as I hate the army, at least they taught me how to use one of these.
Could be I'll make it my profession.
With all the hoods in Toledo swallowing watches and jewelry... there's a big need for experts in this field.
[ potter ] Damn it, Klinger.!
What's keeping you?
- I got doctors here without X-rays.
- Coming, sir.
Never rush an artist.
Boy, what's with him lately?
He really loves me though.
He must.
Why else would he keep me here?
Uh,just hold still.
Think ""cheese." Chin up!
Okay, guys.
Okay, let's go.
Move it.
I got the whole senior class to do.
Sir, I'll have this developed in no time.
- Tracheostomy here.
- I got dibs.
Gloves, please.
Nurse, more orange juice over here.
Gonna leave some for the rest of us, Charles?
I will leave for you exactly what you deserve, Hunnicutt-- the pulp.
Gee, that's great, Charles.
I can start my own newspaper.
Private Rich, glad you could make it.
Let me introduce you to the rest of the band.
On vital signs, Nurse Able.
Workin' the rest of the instruments, Nurse Campbell.
Our wandering minstrel, Major Margaret Houlihan.
And, of course, yours truly, sitting in the conductor's chair.
[ Charles ] Colonel, why don't we ever have enough orangejuice... to get us through these endless sessions?
[ potter ] Drop it,you ding-dong.
- Merely curious.
- Hey.
What's with Colonel Potter?
This is definitely not the time to ask for a raise.
Something's gettin' to him.
Okay, Rich, we're going to anesthetize your neck.
You won't feel anything.
- Everybody in their places?
-Just hold still and relax.
- Why don't you close your eyes?
- [ Garbled Shouting ]
Hey, hey.
Come on.
Come on.
Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise.
Hey, there, Sleeping Beauty.
Who kissed you awake?
Nurse Charming?
How's it goin'?
Oh, yeah.
Can't talk.
Boy, that'd kill me.
How 'bout mine, huh?
This hickey ain't enough to get me into the lobby of an evac hospital.
But I'm playin' it up.
Anytime a nurse or doc comes by, I'm in first-class agony.
You watch.
I'll spend the rest of the war lying' right here.
Oh, by the way, I don't think I ever introduced myself.
Hey, what'd I say?
He's just sleeping off the anesthetic.
Well, men,you played a great first half, but if you really expect to score... you gotta throw a pass.
Let me show you.
Nurse, meet me in the showers after the game?
- Aw, get off it, Hawkeye.
- See what I mean?
[ Chuckles ] Penalty.
Fifteen yards for acting like an idiot.
- Did you hear about Colonel Potter and Radar?
- No.
Are they an item now?
The colonel chewed him out in the Mess Tent about the daily report or something.
Poor Radar just had to sit there and take it.
Somebody ought to get Potter into O.R. and remove that thorn from his paw.
I'd love to know what's bothering him, but I'm afraid to get within 20 feet.
- I know what the problem is.
- Hmm?
- Senility.
- Senility?
Well, look at the symptoms:
chronic irritability... difficulty relating to others, uh, self-absorption--
That's not Potter.
That's you.
The only thing wrong with the colonel is every so often... he gets sick of the madness, just like the rest of us.
You'll see, Pierce.
Wait'll he forgets how to tie his shoes.
Boy, am I glad you're here, Doc.
This thing's killin' me.
The pain's shootin' through my body.
You think you could've missed something?
- Private, I do not miss things.
- [ Groans ]
You have a superficial laceration of the trapezius.
Or, put into words that you could understand... you've got a boo-boo on your shoulder.
You can put it back down now.
If there is any pain, it will subside.
By the way... that was the worst performance I've ever seen in here.
It lacked sincerity, depth.
You're lucky I stayed through the whole show. [ Chuckles ]
Oh, caught me.
I was just eavesdropping on your condition.
These charts come in handy, you know?
Everybody ought to have one.
Anybody asks you how you're doing, you don't have to answer.Just show him your chart.
So how ya doin'?
Oh, a wise guy, huh?
All right, look.
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna block off your tube for a second.
I want to see how you're breathing.
No, no, no.
It's not gonna hurt.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- [ Tracheostomy Tube Sucking ]
- Now try to say a few words for me.
- Anything.
- [ Gagging ]
All right.
That's enough.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
But it's still a little swollen.
Give it a chance to come down a little.
Meantime, stay off your throat.
Do me a favor.
Don't sing Pagliacci.
I'll come back and check on you a little later.
Try to get a little sleep.
Hey, kid.
Don't worry.
They take real good care of you here.
[ Margaret ] private Rich?
Private Rich?
Good morning.
I came by to change your dressing.
There.
As long as I'm here, how about a nice sponge bath?
First we'll loosen your top.
Just relax, Private.
I've done this hundreds of times... and no one's ever died of embarrassment.
You see, the technique in giving a sponge bath... is never to let the ""bathe-ee" know that he's being bathed at all.
You just keep looking at him straight in the eye and talking to him at the same time.
Doesn't matter about what... just so long as he doesn't notice that he's being sponged... and soaped and rinsed off.
And pretty soon, before he's even aware of it... he's had his very first sponge bath.
There.
Done.
That wasn't so bad, now was it?
Judging by that smile, I'd say no.
Well, Private, if you'll excuse me...
I have some other patients to attend to.
[ Man ] Hey, lamb chop.
Bathe me next.
- Sorry.
You're too eager.
- Morning, Major.
Oh, good morning, sir!
Oh, Colonel, you look wonderful this morning.
Back to your old self again.
You've got that spunky look in your eyes.
Leave it by the side of the road, Major.
Feel better, sir.
Please.
Good morning, son.
I'm Colonel Potter, the C.O. around here.
Pleased to meet ya.
From Texas, aren't ya?
I just knew it.
Friendliest boys in the world.
I haven't met a Texan here yet who didn't offer up his hand... no matter how many tubes were comin' out of his arm.
I make it a point to meet everyone who passes through the 4077 th.
I hope you'll excuse my not having stopped by before now... but, uh, the last few days I've had something on my mind.
- It's been kind of pushin' everything else out and I--
- Colonel Potter.
Just a second, son.
What is it, Klinger?
Uh, two things, sir.
First, ""I" Corps is on the phone with their biweekly paper snafu.
Second, and more important, I had nothing to do with it.
I'd better get on it.
Where's Radar?
Anxiously waiting for you in his office, sir.
Just look under his bunk.
Well, speak to you later, son.
If it's General Imbrie, please ask him if he got those flowers I sent him.
Make a hole!
That man's been like a father to me.
Just wish he'd let up on the strap though.
Hey, Rich, Captain Pierce said you could go ambulatory.
How'd you like to see the rest of the grounds?
Okay.
Hang on.
Lieutenant, would you mind bringing that wheelchair over here, please?
We'll go by the Mess Tent, and you'll see how it got its name.
If the trip gets too much for you, let me know and I'll have you home in no time, okay?
- All set?
- Not exactly a Packard... but did you ever try to push a Packard?
[ Imitating Jackie Gleason ] And away we go!
I think we should march right into Colonel Potter's office...
- and demand to know what's bothering him.
- Absolutely right.
When you get back, let me know what he said.
That's the spirit, D'Artagnan.
All for one and one for himself.
- Afternoon, sirs.
- Klinger!
- Hey, Rich!
- I think the tour of the nurses' shower did him a world of good.
Now you've come in here to look at the seamier side of the war, huh?
- Our daily bread is stale again.
- This meat is from the Civil War.
Blue on one side, gray on the other.
Oh, too much for you, huh, kid?
Okay, we'll get you home.
Hey, Klinger, you ought to know better than that.
The Mess Tent is no place to bring a sick person.
Howdy, Texas.
You better remind them to clean up your room.
You're goin' home soon.
Now that you've got that pad, we can finally have a talk.
Which part of the Lone Star state do you hail from?
[ Chuckles ] You don't say.
Got my medical training at Fort Sam Houston.
Good old San Antone.
A bowl of chili down there... would keep you alive for days.
- Uh, Colonel, you forgot to sign this chart.
- I didn't forget.
I'll sign it later.
Now shoo!
I guess it shows, huh?
It's, uh, Mildred, my wife back home.
Lovely girl.
We've been married for 3 5 years as of last Saturday.
Every anniversary, no matter where I am...
I manage to call her.
Tell her how much I--
Well, you know.
This year--
This year I clean forgot.
My thoughts are so filled with this damn war...
I forgot her on our most important day.
I just can't forgive myself for missing it.
I'd like to, son.
Even picked up the phone about 20 times.
But there-
- There's no excuse for my forgetting.
- I don't know what to say to her.
- Evening, boys.
- Excuse me, Pierce.
- Colonel--
What?
What is it?
""Forgo"-
- Oh, yeah. ""Forgot"-- What?
""Forgot anni"-- ""Forgot anniversary."
Oh, so that's what's been getting under Dr.Jekyll's hide.
All right, Pierce.
Admit it.
You broke into my footlocker, and you read through my personal diary, didn't you, swine?
Charles, in all the times I've broken into your footlocker...
I have never looked at your diary.
- Then who drew all these disgusting pictures in it?
- It's dry reading.
- You need illustrations.
- I've had it with you, Pierce.
- It's two-by-fours at dawn.
- [ Gagging ]
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, Rich.
Take it easy.
- [ Coughing ]
- Something's irritating his airway.
Kellye, give me that suction here.
Not doing too well, huh?
Still not getting any air around the tube.
- Fractured larynx?
- I don't know.
It didn't show up before.
- We better take some more pictures, huh?
- Mmm.
Kellye, you want to call for a litter?
- How are you around the larynx?
- Tricky spot.
I wouldn't trust it to anyone but me.
We'll do it together.
And I want credit in your diary.
You still with me, kid?
Let's get him into X-ray.
Doctor?
Colonel.
- Rich, welcome back.
- You gave us quite a scare, son.
But fortunately for you, there was me.
You were on the table for two hours, minus his curtain calls.
- How is his airway?
- So far, okay.
Rich, you had a fractured larynx.
That's what the problem was.
I'm gonna plug your tube, and I want you to talk very quietly and carefully.
Just a few words now.
Okay, talk.
[ Weak Whisper ] Don't know what to say.
- You just spoke volumes.
- Loud and clear.
As if there were any doubt.
Good work, Pierce, although you never could have done it without me.
Congratulations, kid.
You're the talk of the town.
Uh, Colonel Potter, there's a very important phone call for you.
- Tell 'em to hold on, Radar.
- Uh, it's Mrs. Colonel Potter, Colonel.
- Mildred calling me?
- Uh, no, sir.
You called her.
- What?
- It's okay, sir.
She understands.
I explained this is the first time in a week you had a chance to talk to her, so talk to her.
Colonel, wish her a belated happy anniversary for all of us, okay?
I appreciate it, boys.
Remind me to make it up to everybody.
Nope.
This I won't forget.
- A gold star, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, how's he doing?
- Better.
I told ya.
Rich, I want to tell you something.
That operation we had to perform on you was tricky, and, uh...
I was a little worried.
When we were carrying you on that litter... you-you gave me a look of confidence, and that, uh--
I just want you to know that helped a lot.
[ Raspy ] Thank you.
[ Man Over p.A.] Attention.
Attention all personnel.
The night evac bus leaves for Seoul in one minute.
Immediate seating in the club car.
All aboard.!
Ah, Private Rich.
Been nothing but trouble from the minute he came in here.
- I'm glad he's leaving.
- It's smooth sailing from here on, son.
Evac hospital, Tokyo, then home to San Antone.
- Sounds too good, Colonel.
I'm going with him.
- So long, sirs.
Hey, hey.
What did I tell you?
No unnecessary talking unless you meet a good-looking nurse.
- Take care, son.
- Let us know how everything turns out.
Have a nice life.
[ Engine Starts ]
We're going home!
Well, how about it, buddy, huh?
We made it!
We made it!
Yahoo!
Oh!
Oh, you, Rio Grande!
Get in there!
Come on, speed!
¡Viva Mexico!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
Oh!
Yah!
Hah!
Ee-ha ha ha!
¡viva Mexico!
This here's Mexican dirt!
You can't touch me!
Ha ha!
Hee hee hee!
Oh!
Ooh hoo hoo!
You thought you'd get the old man in the moon.
You Texas clown buzzards is a disgrace to the confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down.
Get up!
Come on, speed!
Goddamn it, speed!
You can't do this!
This is Mexican territory!
I don't believe it!
He got across the river, and his horse faints on him!
I can't believe it!
It's a goddamn foreign country here!
This ain't fair, goddamn it!
This ain't fair!
This ain't fair!
They're stringing up old speed.
I have here a very fine animal once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey!
I still own that horse.
When we want to hear from you, amigo, we'll rattle your cage.
Ha ha ha!
Is that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted, but he got up, didn't he?
Ha ha ha!
What?
What?
Oh!
Towfield, I told you to keep these buzzards out of here!
Take it easy, moon.
You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just wanted to take a gander at the man of the hour.
Yeah.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card, moon.
I'm going to miss you.
Your family's here.
Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe,
Jimmy, Gussie, and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy.
He thought you was really my family.
That's how I figured.
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
How you doing, Henry?
Well...
Roll it out.
Nothing like that, Henry.
We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too goddamn good on your own, Henry, did you?
Now, you should have stuck with us because we was going places, goddamn it!
What do you mean "was"?
All you got to do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get ourselves...
Yeah, but that's without my plans.
Ah, cut that out.
Big Abe, they're going to send me to the bone orchard.
If you got anything you want to give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your good-byes, boys.
Nice knowing you.
Yeah, Coogan, sure.
You know, it just ain't right.
Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
The law's got to be changed, Henry.
Come on now, Clyde.
So long, moon.
Adios.
Oh...
Well, honey, least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had...
Except for maybe that circus feller.
Why does that always upset you so?
What the hell did you bring a thing like that up at a time like this for, Hermine?
Shit!
Henry!
Henry!
Don't you worry none, moon.
I'll take care of this girl like she's my very own.
Come on, now.
Oh, Henry!
Henry!
Mr. moon?
It's about that time.
What about my last meal?
You're smoking it.
Ha ha ha!
Hands behind your back, Mr. moon.
He ain't for you, serene.
I wouldn't take you to a dogfight if you was the defending champ.
You oughtn't have done that,
Mr. moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
You tell him about the ordinance?
No.
Why not?
I don't like him, and people I don't like
I don't tell nothing.
Goddamn it, Towfield.
What ordinance?
What ordinance?
Sheriff pile?
Kyle.
We got this ordinance here.
It was passed after the civil war on account of a lot of our boys didn't come home, and the women was beginning to chew up the grass.
I feel sorry for the grass.
I'm feeling sorry for the women.
Anyhow, this ordinance states that any man short of being a murderer can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female, providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, too, as I recollect.
Sweet Jesus H. Christ almighty!
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
I think there's a couple of things about me that I'd like for you to consider.
I don't need your insults.
Oh, I agree with you completely, but you got to take into consideration a man can get a little irritated, and he can act like the dickens when he's about to pull hemp.
Buzzards, huh?
Well, buzzards can fly, and they keep the desert clean.
I cook!
I cook like the son-of-a-bitch!
I mean, like the dickens!
Oh!
Hello, son.
Go to hell.
I understand.
Be quiet!
Shh!
Henry Lloyd moon, you've been found guilty of horse thievery and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this.
I want to tell you good people of longhorn...
Especially you lovely ladies, that the old saying...
"you can't judge a book by its cover"...
It's true.
It's true.
Some books is all scruffed up on the outside, but when you turn around and look inside, why, the words is...
Just...
Wonderful.
Is that it, moon?
Well, isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The lord is my Shepherd."
"I shall not want."
Aw...
"He maketh me to lie down
"in green pastures.
"He leadeth me
"beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul."
That's not right.
"The lord is my Shepherd.
"I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down
"In green pastures.
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me
"beside the still waters.
Yea, though I walk through the valley..."
oh!
I'm a veteran of the great civil war!
The only reason why I turned to crime is there wasn't no jobs...
Not one single job for a man that risked his life for the country...
"Thou anointest my head..."
and the confederacy!
This one's dumb.
He'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the lord forever."
Bullshit!
He's ready to go!
Stop!
I'll take him.
Florence.
Now...
Ah!
Don't you think that you're a mite too elderly to be taking on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran.
He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this son-bitching blindfold off me and let me see my bride!
Where is she?
Florence!
Aah!
Florence!
Ah ha ha!
Ah!
Mrs. Henry moon, let me look at you.
Stand back, folks.
Florence.
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
I think I made her dizzy.
Down she go, up you go!
Is she dead?
At least she died happy.
Then I'll take him.
Julia, what are you saying?
He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you were hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff Kyle, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink!
You want him?
According to the law I can claim him, right?
I asked you out 10 times.
What do I get?
A flap of your umbrella.
Shit!
All right.
Ok, Julia.
Mr. moon, what do you say?
Well, I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off, but...
What the hell.
Fine by me.
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't takin' Frank Tokin's business tonight.
Somebody's taking his business, or we ain't got no business.
¶
¶
Wonderful!
Aha!
Now, Mr. moon, no drinking.
No gambling.
No wife-beating.
No alley-catting, whatnot, and what have you.
You've got to mind her.
If you try running, there will be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you.
Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
Adios!
¡Bienvenidos!
See?
I told you he had a plan.
You'll dance in the air, you son-of-a-bitch...
For stealing' my girl!
Miss, ah...
In case you want to know who you're dealing with...
I used to ride with Quantrell's raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
'Course a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find.
You were standin' in front of the whole town with a rope around your neck.
Yeah.
You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
I'm sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, rover.
That's Grover.
Grover.
This is where I live.
Well, Julia, it ain't much, but it's a start.
Well, I guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
Well then, it, uh...
Looks like an opera house.
Please take your clothes off,
Mr. moon.
Don't sit there.
Here.
Put these on.
These is, uh...
These are work clothes.
That's right.
Well, I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine?
In Texas?
It's going to be.
Looks like mice been into it.
First you'll begin crevassing, then crosscut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't, uh, familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Huh?
Then you insert the drill like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Simple.
Yeah.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blisters easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Uh...
Mr. moon...
Pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck, so let's not waste any more time.
Well,
I'll do all I can do, but that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How did you come into this place?
It was my father's.
Did he believe in this gold mine?
He believed, but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
How's about a little dessert?
Said, uh...
How's about a little dessert?
I heard you the first time.
You didn't answer me the first time.
Um...
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time that you had a man?
I hope you don't mind working in confined spaces because tomorrow we start tunneling.
Goddamn!
I should have known.
You can always tell a virgin on account of the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
Ha ha ha!
See, I got this theory on virgins...
That they always look peaked and grouchy on account of they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back, but in my time, I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Oh, listen.
Don't, uh, let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is, uh...
Hee hee ha hee!
I'll be outside in the barn if you feel like getting acquainted, or, uh, talking about tunneling.
And remember, nature is the great provider.
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh, goddamn.
Well, good morning, spot.
Get you some bacon?
Good morning, miss!
What's for breakfast?
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me.
I know how to pace myself.
If I want to...
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about...
All day long.
Where are you supposed to set?
Where are you going?
Well...
I want to...
Take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacin' yourself.
You just go on trimming' your wicks.
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long!
All day long!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, lady!
No cabeza, no trabajo.
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
An awful lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the city of motherly love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
To Philadelphia?
Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
The pace suits me better...
Slow days and fast nights.
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw the lights and felt we wouldn't be intruding.
Oh, Lorette, you're never intruding.
Uh, y'all remember my husband Henry.
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought along a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
I'll get us some tea.
Shall I help?
We'll help.
Don't be long, now.
We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to, especially now.
Look, honey, what Lorette's trying to say is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Oh.
Since you've never been married before, we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, lorette.
Ha ha ha!
You know, I rode with Quantrell...
Finest revolver gang in history till he died.
Quantrell died?
Last year.
Mmm.
That shorty...
He don't even ask.
He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take no for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night, he got all painted up like an Indian, and did he go on the warpath!
Woo woo woo!
Say, want to have yourself a really wild time?
Why don't you dress up like an Indian?
Ha!
Well, that sounds like it ought to be Julia's cup of tea.
Ha ha ha!
I guess I'll, uh, go on out and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
Uh-huh.
But if it should become one,
I have found that the best thing to do is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
How we doin', ladies?
Bye!
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Let's do it again real soon.
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well...
You know what they say...
Lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog.
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know,
I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air.
Why, it's poetry.
I think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon...
All over America, people's going to be picking up chairs and setting them down.
It's going to be all your doing.
Julia...
What do you say we try canning some of them apricots?
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox
"and looking for two,
"hoping for the help of the lord.
"Why not get rid of all the oxen and count on the maker all the way?"
Very good.
I look forward to hearing it on Sunday.
Thank you.
Morning, ladies.
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night.
Yah!
Julia!
What in the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke.
No.
You don't understand.
A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Miss Tate, please step into the office.
It's, uh, Mrs. moon.
Excuse me.
Miss Tate...
Why, you...
Henry.
I believe this is between Mr. Polty and myself.
Hey, moon!
It looks like the honeymoon is over!
Ha ha ha!
What's the matter, moon?
You're looking like a dog without a bone.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Hector.
Yeah?
Why don't you go down to the Mexican side of town and see what the beans is jumping on.
Beans?
Beans.
You know...
Polty's just another word for chicken.
Good one, Towfield.
Who thought it up for you?
Come on!
Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
Because I'm in a good mood.
Well...
Then, uh, how's about a little snort?
¶
Hey, peachy.
Bottle of mash and two glasses, Norvell.
Not for him.
What do you mean, not for me?
Sheriff's orders.
The sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks.
Ah!
You know, I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for?
Hell!
If you hadn't jerked me back across the border to my just deserts, so to speak, why, I'd never have been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why...
You sort of...
Introduced us.
Yeah, Towfield...
Things is good.
You heard about them matches made in heaven, didn't you?
Well, I'm in one of them.
Goddamn it, moon!
You stole my girl!
Take it easy, Towfield.
You're wrinkling my good-luck bandanna.
How's this...
You give me the bottle, and I'll, uh, I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
She puts chairs up on the wall so's people can't sit on them.
What?
I can't go into it, Towfield.
It's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Duck out back for a snort.
The trouble with Andrew Johnson is he's a damn mugwump.
Oh, don't mention that son-of-a-bitch's name.
Ugh!
Listen, amigo.
I don't ever want you to call me a bean again.
What the hell was that?
This is as difficult for me as it is for you, Julia.
Ha!
You know, a year ago last Christmas Eve,
I had to move 150 Comanche souls off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey?
You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
What do you mean?
This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it concerns me.
The railroad's taking over my land under eminent domain.
Chester, come on!
Eminent domain.
Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature to take away some poor folks' land?
I won't dignify that with an answer.
I ain't askin' for no dignification.
But I do find it interesting that you, uh, prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, moon.
I'm sorry, Julia, but unless I am advised otherwise,
I'll be out to survey.
You know...
Polty's just another way of saying chicken.

Who's there?
What are you doing?
Oh, Julia!
I was just out here surveying.
You liar!
You were spying on me!
Me?
I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia, I swear on my honor
I didn't see a thing!
It's not what you think!
You old...
What's going on here?
Nothing.
You bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying.
There's my equipment...
My tripod, my maps, et cetera.
I caught you, didn't I?
I swear, no.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then apologize.
I apologize.
All right.
Now eminent domain your ass out of here.
Ha ha ha!
Woo, nasty.
Ooh!
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know.
Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
That's all you like to do.
No, that ain't all I like to do.
Uh-uh, moon.
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Ha ha ha!
Ooh!
Nasty!
Damn.
A norther.
It's a norther.
Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Julia...
An outlaw doesn't know how to take no for an answer.
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
Huh?
What am I doing?
Oh, I guess I was dreaming about a tunnel or something.
Get up!
You got me drunk.
I don't remember a thing!
I didn't get you drunk!
Aah!
I will not have that kind of talk in my house!
Hey!
You tricked me!
I didn't trick you.
You get your clothes and get out!
There's work to do!
Oh.
I get it.
You're so afraid that you're going to like that...
That you're going to forget about the gold and Philadelphia!
You get your clothes, and you get out of here!
Son-of-a-bitch!
I was right all these years!
There ain't a lady that knows how to appreciate a man.
No goddamn...
Unnatural questions!
"How did it feel?"
Damn it!
I feel sorry for the poor son-of-a-bitch that, son-of-a-bitch that winds up with you!
Nice being married to you!
Ugh!
Uh!
Oh!
You haven't got a plugged nickel!
You haven't even got a gun!
Yeah!
Uh!
You won't get 20 Miles before a posse will come and get you and string you up!
The only reason why I slept with you was so you'd keep on working!
I hope they hang you!
You...
Oh!
Not the curtain!
You wouldn't dare!
Well...
I hadn't thought of it, but now that you mention it, up in San Francisco,
I seen some Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilization.
They understand things about pleasure that,
I've never even thought of.
One thing for sure...
We ain't had a boring marriage.
¶
Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
But 15 days?
That's not fair.
Tell it to the railroad.
We've been here since '43.
Well, them's the breaks.
Come on!
Damn black goo!
Giddy-up!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Giddy-up!
Huh!
Well...
I was just going into town to...
Buy an anvil.
Julia?
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Uh, me and the little woman haven't been getting along of late.
Don't go in there!
Oh!
Julia?
Julia?
Where's the doctor?
What's the matter, dear?
Where's the doctor?
Doctor...
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I never did get over there.
This pea brain grabbed me and stuck me in an animal wagon.
It would have broke your heart to see it, honey.
You never told me about no doctor.
You never asked me about no doctor.
Is something wrong, Julia?
Female trouble.
Oh...
The vapors.
I better put you to bed, darling.
I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell did you pick him up for, Towfield?
He was dressed up like a Mexican.
You can't arrest a man for that.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
Julia.
I told him.
I told you, but, no, you would...
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not.
Yeah.
I can see it.
Them eyes ain't angry.
They're relieved, and they ain't bloodshot no more.
I wanted you back for one reason...
To work the mine.
Naw.
You missed the old man in the moon.
Ha ha ha!
Hell, I got my faults.
I admit it, but...
Aw, hell, I got my ways, too.
Yeah, I...
I missed you a little bit, too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border,
I couldn't stop but thinking nobody's ever saved my life before.
And I just couldn't leave you in your time of need of me.
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out.
I think I'll take a poca siesta.
Oh, you don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
Bats.
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up, too.
Didn't I want to ride with the younger gang, and they wouldn't have me?
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a younger.
My feelings was hurt, but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw, you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good lord almighty, I've found gold!
Gold!
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I been here.
I know it's around here somewheres.
I can feel it!
I don't see nothing.
It's here.
Believe me.
It's here.
Where?
Goddamn!
Ha ha ha!
Gold.
Look at that!
Gold!
Oh!
Gold!
Goddamn, it's all over everything.
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, honey, kiss me.
I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich.
I knew it.
You wait long enough, and pretty soon, down it's going to come right on you.
Like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know,
I'm going to get my initials put on my saddle, in gold.
They like it that way in Mexico.
All's we got to do now is...
Deposit this first bunch in the bank and then...
"we"?
What do you mean, "we"?
What are you saying?
Well, just that, in all fairness,
I played a part in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd have never struck it if it wasn't for me.
Correcto?
So?
So...
Ha ha!
Where's my...
where's my share in the stake?
Ha ha!
You're right.
I'll give you 10%.
Ha ha ha!
You don't understand.
You see, sharing is giving to each other.
50%.
We'll talk about it later.
Oh, all right, all right, all right.
Uh, 25%, and we can...
Stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny actually depositing something in a bank, huh, moon?
Yeah!
It's a whole new experience for me.
That's it.
Sure are sorry to have you and Miriam leaving us.
Thank you, Mrs. Haber, but with the railroad and this black stuff springing up everywheres, a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Ohhh!
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
Well, I'll guard it with my life.
Aw, you can do better than that, whitey.
Henry Lloyd moon at the bank.
Hmm.
Want one of these?
Sure.
Goddamn it.
I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the younger gang.
Doll,
I think I'll buy me a little cantina
South of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey, I'm going to be a patron.
Tequila...
Cards...
Senoritas...
Hey.
Wait till the Domingi sisters get a load of me!
Ha ha ha!
"Buenas noches, señor moon.
Como esta usted, señor moon?"
"Muy bien, gracias.
Y usted?"
Ha ha ha!
Woo!
Don't do that.
You're acting foolish.
Maybe you ought to try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
50%?
You're going to give me... 50%?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're going to put it that way.
Yeah.
I don't know how to...
Say this, Henry...
But...
I think I got...
Greedy and selfish living alone so long.
Well...
That's how you get.
Once you get started...
You don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
¶
¡Dios mio!
Friends of yours?
Used to be.
What are they doing here?
Good question.
Well, ha ha!
Sorry to keep you all waiting, but, uh...
Me and the missis was just playing a little game of fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree, moon.
Oh, did you?
Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was, uh, going to have you all out.
Well, you damn sure got your wish, didn't you?
Ha ha ha!
I damn sure did.
Ain't you going to ask us in, Henry?
Why, sure, honey pie.
Mi casa es su casa.
Don't you boys know how to wipe your feet?
Hey, hog Coogan!
Wipe your feet off.
Hope you like Taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me big Abe.
Old Henry still snore in his sleep?
¶
I want them out of here!
Not as much as I do.
Moon!
You want them to find out about the dust?
Ha ha ha ha!
Well!
Anybody hungry?
Hungry?
Shit, I could eat a frozen dog.
Ha ha ha!
Well, we'll go on out to the kitchen, and see if we got one already froze.
Ha ha ha!
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
Ha ha ha!
¶
¡Estufado Del diablo!
A feast fit for a king.
That's his speciality.
Them female bullfeathers make it tasty.
Did you know that old Henry used to cook for the raiders?
He cooked for Quantrell's raiders?
No.
He never told me that.
I bet there's a lot of things he never told you.
Shit!
Abe!
Goddamn, Abe.
Jesus Christ!
You'll loosen my molar up!
¶
¶ Grab your girl, now pull on her mane ¶
yahoo!
Just play along a little while longer.
Well, you go on ahead.
I don't want to spoil your fun.
Well, I ain't having a good time.
I swear I ain't.
I'm just trying to throw them off the track.
They wouldn't know it was me if I wasn't acting wild and...
Aw...
Forget about all this.
Get in there and have a good time.
Act foolish!
Woo!
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶

I'll give you my old coyote call.
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶ remember?
A-woo...
Not now.
¶ To me ¶ woo hoo!
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
Nope.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow for the tooth fairy?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Tooth fairy!
You won't get nothing for his molar.
Well, come on, boys.
Let's help big Abe find his goddamn molar.
No!
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Moon, let's you and me go buy big Abe a whole damn set of gold teeth!
Ha ha!
You'll ruin everything acting like a goddamn fool.
I don't give a damn what anybody says!
I'm a gentleman!
And I'm not going to throw up in this here house.
I'm going outside to throw up 'cause I...
I respect your house.
Um...
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house any old time.
Ha ha ha!
Goddamn gold!
Gold!
That son-of-a-bitch is keeping gold from us.
God almighty.
Son-of-a-bitch.
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing?
You don't understand outlaws!
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and start singing your damn fool head off!
Hog liked my singing.
That's why they call him hog!
A-woo!
A-woo!
Aah!
Damn, Hermine.
Quit your goddamn coyote calling.
I'm here.
Your wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
She just had a little too much bug-juice.
Ha ha ha!
I figure you ain't had much of anything of anything in a long time.
How's come you and the boys decided to stop by tonight?
I want to make it good for you, Henry.
Honey, you ain't hearing what I'm asking.
What was the question?
I don't want to hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling, but I told you things has changed.
Crawl in, Henry.
See what I got.
Hermine, you ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell.
We had some times together that I'll never forget.
But, Hermine, now I'm took.
Henry.
Aah!
Hold it.
That's enough.
Uh...
Don't shoot.
Vamoose.
Well...
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why did you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you ain't going to believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of Hermine.
That wasn't all you were trying to get off of her.
All I wanted to know was if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about that damn gold than about me.
That ain't true.
I could have done what you think, but I didn't.
I don't believe you didn't.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman!
You take her, but you forget all about the gold.
People can't afford business partners that cheat on them.
We made an agreement.
And I'm breaking it.
You can't do that to me.
I just did.
That tears it.
Going to put the old double "x" to Henry moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
You want your gun back, moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
What gold?
That gold there.
That's real gold!
Where is it?
You ain't as ignorant as you look, are you?
Come on in.
How much we got here?
Enough.
In fact, I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure, you was.
We're going to hit the longhorn bank.
There ain't nothing in that chicken-feed bank but sun-filled windows.
And all the little lady's gold.
Let's hit her in the morning.
Not yet.
Got a plan?
I'm going to make that woman sorry she ever said, "I do."
I tell you, he's hiding something from us.
I don't think so.
I know so.
I was certain he had a plan.
Me, too, but I don't know if we're going to be in it.
Let's keep a watch on the son-of-a-bitch.
Come on, gang!
You...
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I've got nothing to say.
I keep my word.
Julia!
Honey!
Moon!
Honey, are you all right?
Goddamn!
You all right?
Yes.
Oh!
All right.
Can you stand there?
Yes.
O.K. All right.
You all right?
Well, I've been better.
Easy.
Easy.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Here, hold this.
You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take us a little Spanish pause.
Henry Lloyd?
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but if we're going to die,
I...
I want it to be as partners.
50/50.
We was a good team.
Good?
Shit.
We were the best.
Honey pie...
Moon, I've been thinking.
Since we're going to go anyway, why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Moon, tie me up.
Julia...
We're alive.
I've been watching you, Henry.
Figured.
Ain't you up early?
We don't hit the bank till 10:00.
Well, there's been a little change in plans.
Well, I got to tell big Abe.
You got to do what you got to do.
I'll never forget you, Hermine.
You was the first woman
I didn't have to pay for.
Adios.
You're a mite early, compadre.
I want to make a withdrawal.
Your better half has to do that.
Ordinance husbands aren't allowed to make withdrawals.
Besides, we're closed.
You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there in the bin.
Hurry up, whitey.
I never figured you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, whitey.
Hyah!
Julia!
Julia?
Grover, where is Julia at?
Julia!
Goddamn.
Rocks.
Goddamn, honey pie.
Freeze, moon!
Mr. moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
I guess he ain't heard the news.
Ha ha ha!
What news?
Your wife sold her property to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
When?
Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're on your way to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, moon.
You're on your way to meet senor Peter.
Come out, moon.
We know you got it!
I ain't got nothing!
We don't believe you!
Henry, who the hell is that?
The ex-moon gang.
¡Chinga LA Luna!
If they want a gunfight, they picked the wrong hombresto mess with!
Goddamn you!
Watch it, big Abe!
Ok. 1, 2, 3!
When did she leave?
Why should I tell you?
About a half-hour ago.
Now!
Moon.
Shoot back.
Yes, sir, this is mighty strange stuff.
Muriel dropped a lantern in a puddle of it the other night, and the whole farm 'bout near went up in flame!
Burned half the hair off of my head.
Stunk for two weeks.
The railroad said they've got no use for it, so I thought I'd take samples back east and maybe sell it.
What do you think, miss Julia?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. standard.
I didn't hear what you said.
Hyah!
Aah!
Whoa in there!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Hold up in there.
All right.
Stay calm.
Whoa.
Whoa.
All right.
Step down, Julia.
Whoa.
Cotton, that son-of- a-bitch can shoot.
He rode with Quantrell.
Come on, you've run far enough.
Come on, now.
I'm losing my patience.
You ain't taking my gold!
They discovered gold!
Nah.
They had a little too much bug-juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I supposed to write?
"Good luck, Henry and Hermine"?
I was going to explain everything.
See, I...
Mr. moon.
Are you robbing this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle, or I'll blow everybody into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr. moon.
It's all right, sheriff.
You go on ahead.
He's just trying to impress me.
Are you sure, Julia?
Oh.
Well...
You two ought to try and get along, then.
We all had to.
Hyah!
My heart froze when I came home and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up.
Oh!
Thank you, moon.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure, you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways...
First, let's get used to being rich.
[ Horse whinnies ]
Oh!
Oh, you, Rio Grande!
Get in there!
Come on, speed!
¡Viva Mexico!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
Oh!
Yah!
Hah!
Ee-ha ha ha!
¡viva Mexico!
This here's Mexican dirt!
You can't touch me!
Ha ha!
Hee hee hee!
Oh!
Ooh hoo hoo!
You thought you'd get the old man in the moon.
You Texas clown buzzards is a disgrace to the confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down.
Get up!
Come on, speed!
[ Yelling ]
Goddamn it, speed!
You can't do this!
This is Mexican territory!
[ Yelling ]
I don't believe it!
He got across the river, and his horse faints on him!
I can't believe it!
It's a goddamn foreign country here!
This ain't fair, goddamn it!
This ain't fair!
This ain't fair!
They're stringing up old speed.
I have here a very fine animal once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey!
I still own that horse.
When we want to hear from you, amigo, we'll rattle your cage.
Ha ha ha!
Is that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted, but he got up, didn't he?
Ha ha ha!
What?
What?
Oh!
Towfield, I told you to keep these buzzards out of here!
Take it easy, moon.
You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just wanted to take a gander at the man of the hour.
Yeah.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card, moon.
I'm going to miss you.
Your family's here.
Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe,
Jimmy, Gussie, and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy.
He thought you was really my family.
That's how I figured.
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
How you doing, Henry?
Well...
Roll it out.
Nothing like that, Henry.
We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too goddamn good on your own, Henry, did you?
Now, you should have stuck with us because we was going places, goddamn it!
What do you mean "was"?
All you got to do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get ourselves...
Yeah, but that's without my plans.
Ah, cut that out.
Big Abe, they're going to send me to the bone orchard.
[ Big Abe spits ]
If you got anything you want to give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your good-byes, boys.
Nice knowing you.
Yeah, Coogan, sure.
You know, it just ain't right.
Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
The law's got to be changed, Henry.
Come on now, Clyde.
So long, moon.
Adios.
Oh...
Well, honey, least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had...
Except for maybe that circus feller.
Why does that always upset you so?
What the hell did you bring a thing like that up at a time like this for, Hermine?
Shit!
Henry!
Henry!
[ Sobbing ]
Don't you worry none, moon.
I'll take care of this girl like she's my very own.
Come on, now.
Oh, Henry!
Henry!
Mr. moon?
It's about that time.
What about my last meal?
You're smoking it.
Ha ha ha!
Hands behind your back, Mr. moon.
He ain't for you, serene.
I wouldn't take you to a dogfight if you was the defending champ.
[ Hector laughs ]
You oughtn't have done that,
Mr. moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
You tell him about the ordinance?
No.
Why not?
I don't like him, and people I don't like
I don't tell nothing.
Goddamn it, Towfield.
What ordinance?
What ordinance?
Sheriff pile?
Kyle.
We got this ordinance here.
It was passed after the civil war on account of a lot of our boys didn't come home, and the women was beginning to chew up the grass.
I feel sorry for the grass.
I'm feeling sorry for the women.
Anyhow, this ordinance states that any man short of being a murderer can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female, providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, too, as I recollect.
Sweet Jesus H. Christ almighty!
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
I think there's a couple of things about me that I'd like for you to consider.
I don't need your insults.
Oh, I agree with you completely, but you got to take into consideration a man can get a little irritated, and he can act like the dickens when he's about to pull hemp.
Buzzards, huh?
Well, buzzards can fly, and they keep the desert clean.
I cook!
I cook like the son-of-a-bitch!
I mean, like the dickens!
Oh!
Hello, son.
Go to hell.
I understand.
[ Cow moos ]
Be quiet!
Shh!
Henry Lloyd moon, you've been found guilty of horse thievery and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this.
I want to tell you good people of longhorn...
Especially you lovely ladies, that the old saying...
"you can't judge a book by its cover"...
It's true.
It's true.
Some books is all scruffed up on the outside, but when you turn around and look inside, why, the words is...
Just...
Wonderful.
Is that it, moon?
Well, isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The lord is my Shepherd."
"I shall not want."
Aw...
"He maketh me to lie down
"in green pastures.
"He leadeth me
"beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul."
That's not right.
"The lord is my Shepherd.
"I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down [ Groaning, sobbing ]
"In green pastures.
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me
"beside the still waters.
Yea, though I walk through the valley..."
oh!
I'm a veteran of the great civil war!
The only reason why I turned to crime is there wasn't no jobs...
Not one single job for a man that risked his life for the country...
"Thou anointest my head..."
and the confederacy!
This one's dumb.
He'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the lord forever."
Bullshit!
[ Rapping on window ]
He's ready to go!
Stop!
I'll take him.
Florence.
Now...
Ah!
Don't you think that you're a mite too elderly to be taking on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran.
He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this son-bitching blindfold off me and let me see my bride!
Where is she?
Florence!
Aah!
Florence!
Ah ha ha!
Ah!
Mrs. Henry moon, let me look at you.
[ Sheriff Kyle ] Stand back, folks.
Florence.
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
I think I made her dizzy.
Down she go, up you go!
Is she dead?
[ Man ] At least she died happy.
Then I'll take him.
[ Crowd gasping ]
Julia, what are you saying?
He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you were hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff Kyle, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink!
You want him?
According to the law I can claim him, right?
I asked you out 10 times.
What do I get?
A flap of your umbrella.
Shit!
All right.
Ok, Julia.
Mr. moon, what do you say?
Well, I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off, but...
What the hell.
Fine by me.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't takin' Frank Tokin's business tonight.
[ Gunfire ] Somebody's taking his business, or we ain't got no business.
¶ [ "Wedding march" ]
¶ [ Ranchera ]
Wonderful!
Aha!
Now, Mr. moon, no drinking.
No gambling.
No wife-beating.
No alley-catting, whatnot, and what have you.
You've got to mind her.
If you try running, there will be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you.
Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
Adios!
¡Bienvenidos!
See?
I told you he had a plan.
You'll dance in the air, you son-of-a-bitch...
For stealing' my girl!
Miss, ah...
In case you want to know who you're dealing with...
I used to ride with Quantrell's raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
'Course a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find.
You were standin' in front of the whole town with a rope around your neck.
Yeah.
You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
I'm sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, rover.
That's Grover.
Grover.
[ Rooster crows ]
This is where I live.
Well, Julia, it ain't much, but it's a start.
Well, I guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
Well then, it, uh...
Looks like an opera house.
Please take your clothes off,
Mr. moon.
[ Laughing ]
Don't sit there.
Here.
Put these on.
These is, uh...
These are work clothes.
That's right.
Well, I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine?
In Texas?
It's going to be.
Looks like mice been into it.
First you'll begin crevassing, then crosscut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't, uh, familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Huh?
Then you insert the drill like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Simple.
Yeah.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blisters easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Uh...
Mr. moon...
Pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck, so let's not waste any more time.
Well,
I'll do all I can do, but that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How did you come into this place?
It was my father's.
Did he believe in this gold mine?
He believed, but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
[ Sniffs ]
How's about a little dessert?
Said, uh...
How's about a little dessert?
I heard you the first time.
You didn't answer me the first time.
Um...
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time that you had a man?
I hope you don't mind working in confined spaces because tomorrow we start tunneling.
Goddamn!
I should have known.
You can always tell a virgin on account of the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
Ha ha ha!
See, I got this theory on virgins...
That they always look peaked and grouchy on account of they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back, but in my time, I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Oh, listen.
Don't, uh, let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is, uh...
[ Whistles ]
Hee hee ha hee!
I'll be outside in the barn if you feel like getting acquainted, or, uh, talking about tunneling.
[ Door closes ] And remember, nature is the great provider.
Ha ha ha ha!
[ Crowing ]
[ Grunting ]
Oh, goddamn.
Well, good morning, spot.
Get you some bacon?
Good morning, miss!
What's for breakfast?
[ Clucking ]
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me.
I know how to pace myself.
If I want to...
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about...
All day long.
Where are you supposed to set?
Where are you going?
[ Panting ] Well...
I want to...
Take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacin' yourself.
You just go on trimming' your wicks.
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long!
All day long!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, lady!
No cabeza, no trabajo.
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
An awful lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the city of motherly love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
To Philadelphia?
Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
The pace suits me better...
Slow days and fast nights.
[ Footsteps ]
[ Knock on door ]
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw the lights and felt we wouldn't be intruding.
Oh, Lorette, you're never intruding.
Uh, y'all remember my husband Henry.
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought along a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
I'll get us some tea.
Shall I help?
We'll help.
Don't be long, now.
[ Lorette ] We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to, especially now.
Look, honey, what Lorette's trying to say is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Oh.
Since you've never been married before, we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, lorette.
Ha ha ha!
[ Laughter continues ]
You know, I rode with Quantrell...
Finest revolver gang in history till he died.
Quantrell died?
Last year.
Mmm.
That shorty...
He don't even ask.
He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take no for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night, he got all painted up like an Indian, and did he go on the warpath!
Woo woo woo!
[ Fly buzzing ]
[ SWAT ]
Say, want to have yourself a really wild time?
Why don't you dress up like an Indian?
Ha!
Well, that sounds like it ought to be Julia's cup of tea.
Ha ha ha!
I guess I'll, uh, go on out and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
Uh-huh.
But if it should become one,
I have found that the best thing to do is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
[ Teakettle whistling ]
How we doin', ladies?
Bye!
Thank you for the lovely gift.
[ Henry ] Let's do it again real soon.
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well...
You know what they say...
Lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog.
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know,
I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air.
Why, it's poetry.
I think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon...
All over America, people's going to be picking up chairs and setting them down.
It's going to be all your doing.
Julia...
What do you say we try canning some of them apricots?
[ Door slams shut ]
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox
"and looking for two,
"hoping for the help of the lord.
"Why not get rid of all the oxen and count on the maker all the way?"
Very good.
I look forward to hearing it on Sunday.
Thank you.
[ Henry ] Morning, ladies.
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night.
[ Julia ] Yah!
Julia!
[ Braying ]
What in the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke.
No.
You don't understand.
A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[ Sneezes ]
Miss Tate, please step into the office.
It's, uh, Mrs. moon.
Excuse me.
Miss Tate...
Why, you...
Henry.
I believe this is between Mr. Polty and myself.
Hey, moon!
It looks like the honeymoon is over!
Ha ha ha!
What's the matter, moon?
You're looking like a dog without a bone.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Hector.
Yeah?
Why don't you go down to the Mexican side of town and see what the beans is jumping on.
Beans?
Beans.
[ Neighs ]
You know...
Polty's just another word for chicken.
Good one, Towfield.
Who thought it up for you?
Come on!
Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
Because I'm in a good mood.
Well...
Then, uh, how's about a little snort?
¶ [ Honky-tonk ]
Hey, peachy.
Bottle of mash and two glasses, Norvell.
Not for him.
What do you mean, not for me?
Sheriff's orders.
The sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks.
Ah!
You know, I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for?
Hell!
If you hadn't jerked me back across the border to my just deserts, so to speak, why, I'd never have been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why...
You sort of...
Introduced us.
Yeah, Towfield...
Things is good.
You heard about them matches made in heaven, didn't you?
Well, I'm in one of them.
Goddamn it, moon!
You stole my girl!
Take it easy, Towfield.
You're wrinkling my good-luck bandanna.
How's this...
You give me the bottle, and I'll, uh, I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
[ Sighs ]
She puts chairs up on the wall so's people can't sit on them.
What?
I can't go into it, Towfield.
It's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Duck out back for a snort.
[ Man ] The trouble with Andrew Johnson is he's a damn mugwump.
Oh, don't mention that son-of-a-bitch's name.
[ Horse urinating ]
Ugh!
[ Gunshot ]
[ Neighs ]
Listen, amigo.
I don't ever want you to call me a bean again.
[ Glass shattering ] [ Blows landing ]
What the hell was that?
This is as difficult for me as it is for you, Julia.
Ha!
You know, a year ago last Christmas Eve,
I had to move 150 Comanche souls off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey?
You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
[ Gunfire ]
[ Yelling, shouting ]
[ Henry ] What do you mean?
This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it concerns me.
The railroad's taking over my land under eminent domain.
[ Woman ] Chester, come on!
Eminent domain.
Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature to take away some poor folks' land?
I won't dignify that with an answer.
I ain't askin' for no dignification.
But I do find it interesting that you, uh, prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, moon.
I'm sorry, Julia, but unless I am advised otherwise,
I'll be out to survey.
You know...
Polty's just another way of saying chicken.
¶ [ Julia singing, indistinct ]
¶ They worship gold and dross ¶

Oh, yes.
Oh, oh.
I love you!
[ Sneezes ]
Who's there?
What are you doing?
Oh, Julia!
I was just out here surveying.
You liar!
You were spying on me!
Me?
I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia, I swear on my honor
I didn't see a thing!
It's not what you think!
You old...
What's going on here?
Nothing.
You bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying.
There's my equipment...
My tripod, my maps, et cetera.
I caught you, didn't I?
I swear, no.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then apologize.
I apologize.
All right.
Now eminent domain your ass out of here.
Ha ha ha!
Woo, nasty.
Ooh!
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know.
Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
That's all you like to do.
No, that ain't all I like to do.
Uh-uh, moon.
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
[ Thunder rumbling ] Ha ha ha!
Ooh!
Nasty!
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Thunder continues ]
Damn.
A norther.
It's a norther.
Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Julia...
[ Henry's voice echoing ] An outlaw doesn't know how to take no for an answer.
[ Thunderclap ]
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
Huh?
What am I doing?
Oh, I guess I was dreaming about a tunnel or something.
Get up!
You got me drunk.
I don't remember a thing!
I didn't get you drunk!
Aah!
I will not have that kind of talk in my house!
Hey!
You tricked me!
[ Panting ]
I didn't trick you.
You get your clothes and get out!
There's work to do!
Oh.
I get it.
You're so afraid that you're going to like that...
That you're going to forget about the gold and Philadelphia!
You get your clothes, and you get out of here!
Son-of-a-bitch!
I was right all these years!
There ain't a lady that knows how to appreciate a man.
No goddamn...
Unnatural questions!
"How did it feel?"
Damn it!
I feel sorry for the poor son-of-a-bitch that, son-of-a-bitch that winds up with you!
Nice being married to you!
[ Thunder continues ]
Ugh!
Uh!
Oh!
You haven't got a plugged nickel!
You haven't even got a gun!
Yeah!
Uh!
You won't get 20 Miles before a posse will come and get you and string you up!
The only reason why I slept with you was so you'd keep on working!
I hope they hang you!
You...
Oh!
[ Clucking ]
Not the curtain!
You wouldn't dare!
Well...
I hadn't thought of it, but now that you mention it, up in San Francisco,
I seen some Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilization.
They understand things about pleasure that,
I've never even thought of.
One thing for sure...
We ain't had a boring marriage.
¶ [ Men singing, indistinct ]
[ Man ] Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
But 15 days?
That's not fair.
Tell it to the railroad.
We've been here since '43.
Well, them's the breaks.
[ Hector ] Come on!
[ Spits ]
Damn black goo!
Giddy-up!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Giddy-up!
Huh!
Well...
I was just going into town to...
Buy an anvil.
[ Knocking ]
Julia?
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Uh, me and the little woman haven't been getting along of late.
Don't go in there!
Oh!
Julia?
Julia?
[ Julia ] Where's the doctor?
What's the matter, dear?
Where's the doctor?
Doctor...
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I never did get over there.
This pea brain grabbed me and stuck me in an animal wagon.
It would have broke your heart to see it, honey.
You never told me about no doctor.
You never asked me about no doctor.
Is something wrong, Julia?
Female trouble.
Oh...
The vapors.
[ Henry ] I better put you to bed, darling.
I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell did you pick him up for, Towfield?
He was dressed up like a Mexican.
You can't arrest a man for that.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
Julia.
I told him.
I told you, but, no, you would... [ hoofbeats departing ]
[ Door closes ]
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not.
Yeah.
I can see it.
Them eyes ain't angry.
They're relieved, and they ain't bloodshot no more.
I wanted you back for one reason...
To work the mine.
Naw.
You missed the old man in the moon.
Ha ha ha!
Hell, I got my faults.
I admit it, but...
Aw, hell, I got my ways, too.
Yeah, I...
I missed you a little bit, too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border,
I couldn't stop but thinking nobody's ever saved my life before.
And I just couldn't leave you in your time of need of me.
[ Laughing ]
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out.
I think I'll take a poca siesta.
Oh, you don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
[ Bats screeching ]
Bats.
[ Groaning ]
[ Rumbling ]
[ Boards creaking ]
[ Coughing ]
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up, too.
Didn't I want to ride with the younger gang, and they wouldn't have me?
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a younger.
My feelings was hurt, but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw, you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good lord almighty, I've found gold!
Gold!
[ Creaking ]
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I been here.
I know it's around here somewheres.
I can feel it!
I don't see nothing.
It's here.
Believe me.
It's here.
Where?
[ Creaking ]
Goddamn!
Ha ha ha!
Gold.
Look at that!
Gold!
Oh!
Gold!
Goddamn, it's all over everything.
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, honey, kiss me.
I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich.
I knew it.
You wait long enough, and pretty soon, down it's going to come right on you.
Like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know,
I'm going to get my initials put on my saddle, in gold.
They like it that way in Mexico.
All's we got to do now is...
Deposit this first bunch in the bank and then...
"we"?
What do you mean, "we"?
What are you saying?
Well, just that, in all fairness,
I played a part in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd have never struck it if it wasn't for me.
Correcto?
So?
So...
Ha ha!
Where's my...
where's my share in the stake?
Ha ha!
You're right.
I'll give you 10%.
Ha ha ha!
You don't understand.
You see, sharing is giving to each other.
50%.
We'll talk about it later.
Oh, all right, all right, all right.
Uh, 25%, and we can...
Stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny actually depositing something in a bank, huh, moon?
Yeah!
It's a whole new experience for me.
That's it.
Sure are sorry to have you and Miriam leaving us.
Thank you, Mrs. Haber, but with the railroad and this black stuff springing up everywheres, a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Ohhh!
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
Well, I'll guard it with my life.
Aw, you can do better than that, whitey.
[ Laughing ]
Henry Lloyd moon at the bank.
Hmm.
Want one of these?
Sure.
[ Indistinct ]
Goddamn it.
I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the younger gang.
Doll,
I think I'll buy me a little cantina
South of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey, I'm going to be a patron.
Tequila...
Cards...
Senoritas...
Hey.
Wait till the Domingi sisters get a load of me!
Ha ha ha!
"Buenas noches, señor moon.
Como esta usted, señor moon?"
"Muy bien, gracias.
Y usted?"
Ha ha ha!
Woo!
Don't do that.
You're acting foolish.
[ Owl hooting ]
Maybe you ought to try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
50%?
You're going to give me... 50%?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're going to put it that way.
Yeah.
I don't know how to...
Say this, Henry...
But...
I think I got...
Greedy and selfish living alone so long.
Well...
That's how you get.
Once you get started...
You don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
[ Bell ringing ]
¶ [ Fiddle ]
[ Shouting ]
¡Dios mio!
Friends of yours?
Used to be.
What are they doing here?
Good question.
[ Pounding on door ]
[ Henry ] Well, ha ha!
Sorry to keep you all waiting, but, uh...
Me and the missis was just playing a little game of fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree, moon.
Oh, did you?
Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was, uh, going to have you all out.
Well, you damn sure got your wish, didn't you?
Ha ha ha!
I damn sure did.
Ain't you going to ask us in, Henry?
Why, sure, honey pie.
Mi casa es su casa.
Don't you boys know how to wipe your feet?
[ Big Abe ] Hey, hog Coogan!
Wipe your feet off.
[ Stomping feet ]
Hope you like Taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me big Abe.
Old Henry still snore in his sleep?
¶ [ Tapping piano keys ]
I want them out of here!
Not as much as I do.
Moon!
You want them to find out about the dust?
Ha ha ha ha!
Well!
Anybody hungry?
Hungry?
Shit, I could eat a frozen dog.
Ha ha ha!
Well, we'll go on out to the kitchen, and see if we got one already froze.
Ha ha ha!
[ Hog ] I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
Ha ha ha!
¶ [ Tapping on piano ]
¡Estufado Del diablo!
A feast fit for a king.
That's his speciality.
Them female bullfeathers make it tasty.
Did you know that old Henry used to cook for the raiders?
He cooked for Quantrell's raiders?
No.
He never told me that.
I bet there's a lot of things he never told you.
[ Laughs, spits ] Shit!
Abe!
Goddamn, Abe.
Jesus Christ!
You'll loosen my molar up!
¶ [ Fiddle ] [ Laughing, shouting ]
¶ Grab your girl, now pull on her mane ¶
yahoo!
Just play along a little while longer.
Well, you go on ahead.
I don't want to spoil your fun.
Well, I ain't having a good time.
I swear I ain't.
I'm just trying to throw them off the track.
They wouldn't know it was me if I wasn't acting wild and...
Aw...
Forget about all this.
Get in there and have a good time.
[ Slaps bottom ] Act foolish!
Woo!
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶
¶ awaken to me ¶
¶ beautiful dreamer ¶
¶ waken to me ¶
¶ starlight and dewdrops are waitin' for thee ¶ [ hog ] ¶ thee ¶ ah, shit.
¶ [ Continues ]
This ain't no real marriage.
Come on.
Meet me tonight, huh?
I'll give you my old coyote call.
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶ remember?
A-woo...
Not now.
¶ To me ¶ woo hoo!
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
Nope.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow for the tooth fairy?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Tooth fairy!
You won't get nothing for his molar.
[ Julia ] Well, come on, boys.
Let's help big Abe find his goddamn molar.
No!
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Moon, let's you and me go buy big Abe a whole damn set of gold teeth!
Ha ha!
[ Whispering ] You'll ruin everything acting like a goddamn fool.
I don't give a damn what anybody says!
I'm a gentleman!
[ Blows raspberry ]
And I'm not going to throw up in this here house.
I'm going outside to throw up 'cause I...
I respect your house.
Um...
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house any old time.
Ha ha ha!
Goddamn gold!
Gold!
That son-of-a-bitch is keeping gold from us.
God almighty.
Son-of-a-bitch.
[ Hoofbeats departing ]
[ Footsteps ]
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing?
You don't understand outlaws!
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and start singing your damn fool head off!
Hog liked my singing.
That's why they call him hog!
[ Door slams shut ]
[ Hermine ] A-woo!
[ Henry howling ]
A-woo!
[ Coyotes howling ]
Aah!
Damn, Hermine.
Quit your goddamn coyote calling.
I'm here.
Your wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
She just had a little too much bug-juice.
Ha ha ha!
I figure you ain't had much of anything of anything in a long time.
How's come you and the boys decided to stop by tonight?
I want to make it good for you, Henry.
Honey, you ain't hearing what I'm asking.
What was the question?
I don't want to hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling, but I told you things has changed.
Crawl in, Henry.
See what I got.
Hermine, you ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell.
We had some times together that I'll never forget.
But, Hermine, now I'm took.
Henry.
Aah!
[ Coyote howling ]
[ Julia ] Hold it.
That's enough.
Uh...
Don't shoot.
Vamoose.
Well...
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why did you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you ain't going to believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of Hermine.
That wasn't all you were trying to get off of her.
All I wanted to know was if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about that damn gold than about me.
That ain't true.
I could have done what you think, but I didn't.
I don't believe you didn't.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman!
You take her, but you forget all about the gold.
People can't afford business partners that cheat on them.
We made an agreement.
And I'm breaking it.
You can't do that to me.
I just did.
That tears it.
Going to put the old double "x" to Henry moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
You want your gun back, moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
What gold?
That gold there.
That's real gold!
Where is it?
You ain't as ignorant as you look, are you?
Come on in.
How much we got here?
Enough.
In fact, I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure, you was.
We're going to hit the longhorn bank.
There ain't nothing in that chicken-feed bank but sun-filled windows.
And all the little lady's gold.
Let's hit her in the morning.
Not yet.
Got a plan?
I'm going to make that woman sorry she ever said, "I do."
I tell you, he's hiding something from us.
[ Coogan ] I don't think so.
I know so.
[ Hog ] I was certain he had a plan.
Me, too, but I don't know if we're going to be in it.
Let's keep a watch on the son-of-a-bitch.
[ Abe ] Come on, gang!
You...
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I've got nothing to say.
[ Creaking ]
I keep my word.
[ Explosion ]
[ Henry ] Julia!
[ Rocks falling ]
Honey!
Moon!
Honey, are you all right?
Goddamn!
You all right?
Yes.
Oh!
All right.
[ Creaking ]
Can you stand there?
Yes.
O.K. All right.
[ Rumbling ]
[ Julia screaming ]
You all right?
Well, I've been better.
[ Creaking ]
Easy.
Easy.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Here, hold this.
You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take us a little Spanish pause.
[ Creaking ]
Henry Lloyd?
[ Henry ] What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but if we're going to die,
I...
I want it to be as partners.
50/50.
We was a good team.
Good?
Shit.
We were the best.
Honey pie...
Moon, I've been thinking.
Since we're going to go anyway, why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Moon, tie me up.
Julia...
We're alive.
I've been watching you, Henry.
Figured.
Ain't you up early?
We don't hit the bank till 10:00.
Well, there's been a little change in plans.
Well, I got to tell big Abe.
You got to do what you got to do.
I'll never forget you, Hermine.
You was the first woman
I didn't have to pay for.
Adios.
[ Knocks on door ]
You're a mite early, compadre.
I want to make a withdrawal.
Your better half has to do that.
Ordinance husbands aren't allowed to make withdrawals.
Besides, we're closed.
You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there in the bin.
Hurry up, whitey.
I never figured you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, whitey.
Hyah!
Julia!
Julia?
Grover, where is Julia at?
Julia!
Goddamn.
Rocks.
Goddamn, honey pie.
Freeze, moon!
Mr. moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
I guess he ain't heard the news.
Ha ha ha!
What news?
Your wife sold her property to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
When?
Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're on your way to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, moon.
You're on your way to meet senor Peter.
[ Gunfire ]
Come out, moon.
We know you got it!
I ain't got nothing!
We don't believe you!
Henry, who the hell is that?
The ex-moon gang.
¡Chinga LA Luna!
If they want a gunfight, they picked the wrong hombresto mess with!
Goddamn you!
Watch it, big Abe!
Ok. 1, 2, 3!
When did she leave?
Why should I tell you?
About a half-hour ago.
Now!
Moon.
Shoot back.
Yes, sir, this is mighty strange stuff.
Muriel dropped a lantern in a puddle of it the other night, and the whole farm 'bout near went up in flame!
Burned half the hair off of my head.
Stunk for two weeks.
The railroad said they've got no use for it, so I thought I'd take samples back east and maybe sell it.
What do you think, miss Julia?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. standard.
I didn't hear what you said.
[ Gunshot ]
Hyah!
Aah!
Whoa in there!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Hold up in there.
All right.
Stay calm.
Whoa.
Whoa.
All right.
Step down, Julia.
Whoa.
Cotton, that son-of- a-bitch can shoot.
He rode with Quantrell.
Come on, you've run far enough.
Come on, now.
I'm losing my patience.
You ain't taking my gold!
They discovered gold!
Nah.
They had a little too much bug-juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I supposed to write?
"Good luck, Henry and Hermine"?
I was going to explain everything.
See, I... [ sheriff Kyle ] Mr. moon.
Are you robbing this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle, or I'll blow everybody into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr. moon.
It's all right, sheriff.
You go on ahead.
He's just trying to impress me.
[ Sheriff Kyle ] Are you sure, Julia?
Oh.
Well...
You two ought to try and get along, then.
We all had to.
Hyah!
My heart froze when I came home and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up.
Oh!
Thank you, moon.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure, you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways...
First, let's get used to being rich.
[ Horse Whinnies ]
OH!
OH, YOU, RIO GRANDE!
GET IN THERE!
COME ON, SPEED!
i¡¡VIVA MEXICO!
AH HA HA HA HA!
OH!
OH!
YAH!
HAH!
EE-HA HA HA!
i¡¡VIVA MEXICO!
THIS HERE'S MEXICAN DIRT!
YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME!
HA HA!
HEE HEE HEE!
OH!
OOH HOO HOO!
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D GET THE OLD MAN IN THE MOON.
YOU TEXAS CLOWN BUZZARDS IS A DISGRACE TO THE CONFEDERACY.
SPEED, THIS AIN'T NO TIME
TO LET ME DOWN.
GET UP!
COME ON, SPEED!
[ Yelling ]
GODDAMN IT, SPEED!
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!
THIS IS MEXICAN TERRITORY!
[ Yelling ]
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
HE GOT ACROSS THE RIVER,
AND HIS HORSE FAINTS ON HIM!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
IT'S A GODDAMN FOREIGN COUNTRY HERE!
THIS AIN'T FAIR, GODDAMN IT!
THIS AIN'T FAIR!
THIS AIN'T FAIR!
THEY'RE STRINGING UP OLD SPEED.
I HAVE HERE A VERY FINE ANIMAL
ONCE OWNED BY THEHOMBRE
WE'RE ABOUT TO HANG.
WHAT AM I OFFERED?
HEY!
I STILL OWN THAT HORSE.
WHEN WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU, AMIGO,
WE'LL RATTLE YOUR CAGE.
HA HA HA!
IS THAT THE HORSE THAT FAINTED?
YEAH, HE FAINTED,
BUT HE GOT UP, DIDN'T HE?
HA HA HA!
WHAT?
WHAT?
OH!
TOWFIELD, I TOLD YOU
TO KEEP THESE BUZZARDS OUT OF HERE!
TAKE IT EASY, MOON.
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE GETTING A DECENT HANGING.
I'D HAVE DONE IT OUT THERE
ON A SCRUB OAK.
GODDAMN VULTURES HANGING AROUND HERE
ALL MORNING.
THEY JUST WANTED TO TAKE A GANDER
AT THE MAN OF THE HOUR.
YEAH.
WELL, I'M FLATTERED AS HELL.
YOU'RE A REAL CARD, MOON.
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.
YOUR FAMILY'S HERE.
MAKE IT SHORT.
BOYS!
BROTHER ABE,
JIMMY, GUSSIE, AND EVERYBODY.
DUMB-ASS DEPUTY.
HE THOUGHT YOU WAS REALLY MY FAMILY.
THAT'S HOW I FIGURED.
YOU LOOK PRETTY AS A PAINTING, HONEY.
HOW YOU DOING, HENRY?
WELL...
ROLL IT OUT.
NOTHING LIKE THAT, HENRY.
WE JUST COME TO SEE YOU OFF.
SEE ME OFF?
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU DID TOO GODDAMN GOOD
ON YOUR OWN, HENRY, DID YOU?
NOW, YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH US
BECAUSE WE WAS GOING PLACES, GODDAMN IT!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WAS"?
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS SPRING ME.
IF WE TRIED ANYTHING,
WE'D ONLY GET OURSELVES--
YEAH, BUT THAT'S WITHOUT MY PLANS.
AH, CUT THAT OUT.
BIG ABE, THEY'RE GOING TO SEND ME
TO THE BONE ORCHARD.
[ Big Abe Spits ]
IF YOU GOT ANYTHING YOU WANT TO GIVE AWAY, HENRY,
NOW'S THE TIME.
SAY YOUR GOOD-BYES, BOYS.
NICE KNOWING YOU.
YEAH, COOGAN, SURE.
YOU KNOW, IT JUST AIN'T RIGHT.
JUST FOR CUTTING A FEW HORSES AND ROBBING A FEW BANKS.
THE LAW'S GOT TO BE CHANGED, HENRY.
COME ON NOW, CLYDE.
SO LONG, MOON.
ADIOS.
OH...
WELL, HONEY, LEAST WE HAD
SOME GOOD OLD TIMES TOGETHER.
YOU WAS THE BEST I EVER HAD...
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THAT CIRCUS FELLER.
WHY DOES THAT ALWAYS UPSET YOU SO?
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU BRING A THING LIKE THAT UP
AT A TIME LIKE THIS FOR, HERMINE?
SHIT!
HENRY!
HENRY!
[ Sobbing ]
DON'T YOU WORRY NONE, MOON.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS GIRL
LIKE SHE'S MY VERY OWN.
COME ON, NOW.
OH, HENRY!
HENRY!
MR. MOON?
IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME.
WHAT ABOUT MY LAST MEAL?
YOU'RE SMOKING IT.
HA HA HA!
HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK, MR. MOON.
HE AIN'T FOR YOU, SERENE.
I WOULDN'T TAKE YOU TO A DOGFIGHT
IF YOU WAS THE DEFENDING CHAMP.
[ Hector Laughs ]
YOU OUGHTN'T HAVE DONE THAT,
MR. MOON.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
KEEP ME IN JAIL FOR IT?
YOU TELL HIM ABOUT THE ORDINANCE?
NO.
WHY NOT?
I DON'T LIKE HIM,
AND PEOPLE I DON'T LIKE
I DON'T TELL NOTHING.
GODDAMN IT, TOWFIELD.
WHAT ORDINANCE?
WHAT ORDINANCE?
SHERIFF PILE?
KYLE.
WE GOT THIS ORDINANCE HERE.
IT WAS PASSED AFTER THE CIVIL WAR
ON ACCOUNT OF A LOT OF OUR BOYS
DIDN'T COME HOME,
AND THE WOMEN WAS BEGINNING
TO CHEW UP THE GRASS.
I FEEL SORRY FOR THE GRASS.
I'M FEELING SORRY FOR THE WOMEN.
ANYHOW, THIS ORDINANCE STATES
THAT ANY MAN SHORT OF BEING A MURDERER
CAN BE SAVED FROM THE GALLOWS
BY ANY PROPERTY-HOLDING FEMALE,
PROVIDING SHE DECIDES TO MARRY HIM.
THEY DONE THAT IN ROMAN TIMES, TOO,
AS I RECOLLECT.
SWEET JESUS H. CHRIST ALMIGHTY!
MA'AM!
MA'AM!
I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS
ABOUT ME THAT I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER.
I DON'T NEED YOUR INSULTS.
OH, I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY,
BUT YOU GOT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION
A MAN CAN GET A LITTLE IRRITATED,
AND HE CAN ACT LIKE THE DICKENS
WHEN HE'S ABOUT TO PULL HEMP.
BUZZARDS, HUH?
WELL, BUZZARDS CAN FLY,
AND THEY KEEP THE DESERT CLEAN.
I COOK!
I COOK LIKE THE SON-OF-A-BITCH!
I MEAN, LIKE THE DICKENS!
OH!
HELLO, SON.
GO TO HELL.
I UNDERSTAND.
[ Cow Moos ]
BE QUIET!
SHH!
HENRY LLOYD MOON,
YOU'VE BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF HORSE THIEVERY
AND SENTENCED TO BE HANGED.
DO YOU HAVE ANY FINAL LAST WORDS?
JUST THIS.
I WANT TO TELL YOU GOOD PEOPLE
OF LONGHORN...
ESPECIALLY YOU LOVELY LADIES,
THAT THE OLD SAYING--
"YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER"--
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.
SOME BOOKS IS ALL SCRUFFED UP ON THE OUTSIDE,
BUT WHEN YOU TURN AROUND AND LOOK INSIDE,
WHY, THE WORDS IS...
JUST...
WONDERFUL.
IS THAT IT, MOON?
WELL, ISN'T THERE ANYBODY ELSE GOT ANYTHING TO SAY?
"THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD.
"I SHALL NOT WANT.
AW...
"HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN
"IN GREEN PASTURES.
"HE LEADETH ME
"BESIDE THE STILL WATERS.
HE RESTORETH MY SOUL."
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
"THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD.
"I SHALL NOT WANT.
"HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN [ Groaning, Sobbing ]
"IN GREEN PASTURES.
"HE RESTORETH MY SOUL.
"HE LEADETH ME
"BESIDE THE STILL WATERS.
YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY--"
OH!
I'M A VETERAN OF THE GREAT CIVIL WAR!
THE ONLY REASON WHY I TURNED TO CRIME
IS THERE WASN'T NO JOBS--
NOT ONE SINGLE JOB
FOR A MAN THAT RISKED HIS LIFE
FOR THE COUNTRY...
"THOU ANOINTEST MY HEAD--"
AND THE CONFEDERACY!
THIS ONE'S DUMB.
HE'LL SWING FOR SURE.
HE'S BETTER OFF.
"AND I WILL DWELL
IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER."
BULLSHIT!
[ Rapping On Window ]
HE'S READY TO GO!
STOP!
I'LL TAKE HIM.
FLORENCE.
NOW--
AH!
DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE
A MITE TOO ELDERLY
TO BE TAKING ON A RESPONSIBILITY LIKE THIS?
I'VE GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT HIM, ANDREW.
THE BOY'S A VETERAN.
HE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE.
SOMEBODY TAKE THIS SON-BITCHING BLINDFOLD OFF ME
AND LET ME SEE MY BRIDE!
WHERE IS SHE?
FLORENCE!
AAH!
FLORENCE!
AH HA HA!
AH!
MRS. HENRY MOON,
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.
[ Sheriff Kyle ] STAND BACK, FOLKS.
FLORENCE.
STAND BACK, PLEASE.
JUST AIN'T YOUR DAY.
MAYBE SHE JUST FAINTED.
I THINK I MADE HER DIZZY.
DOWN SHE GO, UP YOU GO!
IS SHE DEAD?
[ Man ] AT LEAST SHE DIED HAPPY.
THEN I'LL TAKE HIM.
[ Crowd Gasping ]
JULIA, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
HE'S AN OUTLAW.
I ASSUMED THAT'S WHY YOU WERE HANGING HIM.
ARE YOU DRUNK?
SHERIFF KYLE, YOU KNOW I DON'T DRINK.
'COURSE SHE DON'T DRINK!
YOU WANT HIM?
ACCORDING TO THE LAW I CAN CLAIM HIM, RIGHT?
I ASKED YOU OUT 10 TIMES.
WHAT DO I GET?
A FLAP OF YOUR UMBRELLA.
SHIT!
ALL RIGHT.
OK, JULIA.
MR. MOON,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WELL, I AIN'T NO SIDE OF BEEF TO BE AUCTIONED OFF,
BUT...
WHAT THE HELL.
FINE BY ME.
[ Crowd Murmuring ]
WELL, I THINK I'LL SKIP THE WEDDING.
I AIN'T TAKIN' FRANK TOKIN'S BUSINESS TONIGHT.
[ Gunfire ] SOMEBODY'S TAKING HIS BUSINESS,
OR WE AIN'T GOT NO BUSINESS.
?
[ "Wedding March" ]
?
[ Ranchera ]
WONDERFUL!
AHA!
NOW, MR. MOON, NO DRINKING.
NO GAMBLING.
NO WIFE-BEATING.
NO ALLEY-CATTING, WHATNOT, AND WHAT HAVE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT TO MINDHER.
IF YOU TRY RUNNING,
THERE WILL BE $500 ON YOUR HEAD.
WELL, GENTLEMEN,
MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU.
MUCH OBLIGED.
SHALL I TAKE THE REINS, DEAR?
ADIOS!
i¡¡BIENVENIDOS!
SEE?
I TOLD YOU HE HAD A PLAN.
YOU'LL DANCE IN THE AIR, YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH...
FOR STEALIN' MY GIRL!
MISS, AH...
IN CASE YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH...
I USED TO RIDE WITH QUANTRELL'S RAIDERS.
YOU ALWAYS THIS QUIET?
WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, YOU'LL HEAR IT.
WELL LOOK, I CAN GET OFF RIGHT HERE
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
'COURSE A GOOD HUSBAND'S HARD TO FIND.
YOU WEREN'T HARD TO FIND.
YOU WERE STANDIN' IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE TOWN
WITH A ROPE AROUND YOUR NECK.
YEAH.
YOU SURE ARE A SMART WOMAN.
I LIKE SMART WOMEN.
I'M SURE YOU DO.
WHO'S THAT?
ONE OF THE REASONS WE GOT MARRIED.
HEY, ROVER.
THAT'S GROVER.
GROVER.
[ Rooster Crows ]
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE.
WELL, JULIA, IT AIN'T MUCH,
BUT IT'S A START.
WELL, I GUESS I DON'T GET TO CARRY YOU
ACROSS THE THRESHOLD.
WIPE YOUR FEET, PLEASE.
ALWAYS DO.
WELL THEN,
IT, UH...
LOOKS LIKE AN OPERA HOUSE.
PLEASE TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF,
MR. MOON.
[ Laughing ]
DON'T SIT THERE.
HERE.
PUT THESE ON.
THESE IS, UH...
THESE ARE WORK CLOTHES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, I JUST GOT MARRIED.
DON'T COUNT ON THAT TOO MUCH.
THIS IS A GOLD MINE?
IN TEXAS?
IT'S GOING TO BE.
LOOKS LIKE MICE BEEN INTO IT.
FIRST YOU'LL BEGIN CREVASSING,
THEN CROSSCUT USING THE SINGULAR JACKING METHOD.
I AIN'T, UH, FAMILIAR WITH THAT PARTICULAR METHOD.
YOU PRY AWAY ANY LOOSE ROCKS.
ARE YOU WATCHING?
HUH?
THEN YOU INSERT THE DRILL
LIKE THIS.
THEN YOU USE THE SLEDGEHAMMER.
SIMPLE.
SIMPLE.
YEAH.
WHERE'S THE GLOVES?
MY HANDS BLISTERS EASY.
BETTER BLISTERS THAN NECK BURNS.
UH...
MR. MOON--
PRETEND WE'RE FRIENDS AND CALL ME HENRY.
THE RAILROAD IS BREATHING DOWN MY NECK,
SO LET'S NOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME.
WELL,
I'LL DO ALL I CAN DO,
BUT THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.
I'LL BE OUTSIDE RUNNING AURIFEROUS TESTS.
WHY DON'T YOU RUN ONE ON YOUR SKULL
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?
SUPPER'S READY.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN WASTING TIME
AT THE TABLE.
HOW DID YOU COME INTO THIS PLACE?
IT WAS MY FATHER'S.
DID HE BELIEVE IN THIS GOLD MINE?
HE BELIEVED,
BUT NOT ENOUGH.
SOUNDS LIKE HE WAS THE BRAINS
IN THE FAMILY.
BOILED CHICKEN?
BOILED IS BETTER FOR YOU.
[ Sniffs ]
HOW'S ABOUT A LITTLE DESSERT?
SAID, UH...
HOW'S ABOUT A LITTLE DESSERT?
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME.
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER ME THE FIRST TIME.
UM...
CAN I ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION?
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT YOU HAD A MAN?
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND WORKING IN CONFINED SPACES
BECAUSE TOMORROW WE START TUNNELING.
GODDAMN!
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL A VIRGIN
ON ACCOUNT OF THE WHITES OF THE EYES AIN'T CLEAR.
HA HA HA!
SEE, I GOT THIS THEORY ON VIRGINS--
THAT THEY ALWAYS LOOK PEAKED AND GROUCHY
ON ACCOUNT OF THEY'RE GOING AGAINST NATURE.
I DON'T WANT TO GET CALLUSES PATTING MYSELF ON THE BACK,
BUT IN MY TIME, I HAVE PUT A GAL OR TWO IN TUNE WITH NATURE.
I'M SURE NATURE IS VERY GRATEFUL.
OH, LISTEN.
DON'T, UH, LET STARTING LATE BOTHER YOU NONE.
SOME OF THEM LATE BLOOMERS IS, UH...
[ Whistles ]
HEE HEE HA HEE!
I'LL BE OUTSIDE IN THE BARN
IF YOU FEEL LIKE GETTING ACQUAINTED,
OR, UH, TALKING ABOUT TUNNELING.
[ Door Closes ] AND REMEMBER,
NATUREIS THE GREAT PROVIDER.
HA HA HA HA!
[ Crowing ]
[ Grunting ]
OH, GODDAMN.
WELL, GOOD MORNING, SPOT.
GET YOU SOME BACON?
GOOD MORNING, MISS!
WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST?
[ Clucking ]
CONSERVE YOUR ENERGY.
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME.
I KNOW HOW TO PACE MYSELF.
IF I WANT TO...
I CAN DO THIS ALL DAY LONG.
I'M TALKING ABOUT...
ALL DAY LONG.
WHERE ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO SET?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
[ Panting ] WELL...
I WANT TO...
TAKE A LITTLE SPANISH PAUSE.
THAT'S ONE OF THE KEYS
TO PACIN' YOURSELF.
YOU JUST GO ON TRIMMIN' YOUR WICKS.
I CAN DO THIS ALL DAY LONG.
I'M TALKING ABOUT ALLDAY LONG!
ALL DAY LONG!
HA HA HA HA!
HEY, LADY!
NO CABEZA, NO TRABAJO.
UNDERSTAND?
SHE SURE IS FULL OF PISS AND VINEGAR TODAY, AIN'T SHE?
AN AWFUL LOT OF LITERATURE ON PHILADELPHIA.
WHAT'S THE FASCINATION WITH THE CITY OF MOTHERLY LOVE?
BROTHERLY.
I'M MOVING THERE.
TO PHILADELPHIA?
JUST AS SOON AS I STRIKE GOLD.
I LIKE IT DOWN THERE IN MEXICO.
THE PACE SUITS ME BETTER--
SLOW DAYS AND FAST NIGHTS.
[ Footsteps ]
[ Knock On Door ]
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.
WE SAW THE LIGHTS AND FELT WE WOULDN'T BE INTRUDING.
OH, LORETTE, YOU'RE NEVER INTRUDING.
UH, Y'ALL REMEMBER MY HUSBAND HENRY.
WELCOME TO OUR HUMBLE ABODE.
WE BROUGHT ALONG A LITTLE WEDDING SOMETHING.
OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.
HOW PRETTY.
WE WAS JUST SAYING
HOW MUCH WE NEEDED A FIGURINE.
I'LL GET US SOME TEA.
SHALL I HELP?
WE'LL HELP.
DON'T BE LONG, NOW.
[ Lorette ] WE FELT YOU'D BE NEEDING
SOMEONE TO TALK TO,
ESPECIALLY NOW.
LOOK, HONEY, WHAT LORETTE'S TRYING TO SAY
IS THAT WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON THESE DAYS.
WE DO?
WE'RE ALL ORDINANCE BRIDES.
OH.
SINCE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN MARRIED BEFORE,
WE ALL THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.
DO YOU PREFER ORANGE PEKOE OR LAPSANG OOLONG?
YOU SEE, A HUSBAND HAS CERTAIN RIGHTS.
AND A WIFE HAS CERTAIN DUTIES.
AND THAT'S WHERE THE TROUBLE STARTS.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, LORETTE.
HA HA HA!
[ Laughter Continues ]
YOU KNOW, I RODE WITH QUANTRELL--
FINEST REVOLVER GANG IN HISTORY
TILL HE DIED.
QUANTRELL DIED?
LAST YEAR.
MMM.
THAT SHORTY...
HE DON'T EVEN ASK.
HE JUST GOES RIGHT TO IT.
THOSE OUTLAWS JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.
WHITEY IS SO FUNNY.
WHY, LAST NIGHT,
HE GOT ALL PAINTED UP LIKE AN INDIAN,
AND DID HE GO ON THE WARPATH!
WOO WOO WOO!
[ Fly Buzzing ]
[ Swat ]
SAY, WANT TO HAVE YOURSELF A REALLY WILD TIME?
WHY DON'T YOU DRESS UP LIKE AN INDIAN?
HA!
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE IT OUGHT TO BE JULIA'S CUP OF TEA.
HA HA HA!
I GUESS I'LL, UH, GO ON OUT
AND SEE HOW THE SQUAWS ARE DOING.
I SUPPOSE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY, JULIA,
IS IT'S NOT AS MUCH OF A CHORE
AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD.
UH-HUH.
BUT IF IT SHOULD BECOME ONE,
I HAVE FOUND
THAT THE BEST THING TO DO
IS JUST THINK ABOUT CANNING APRICOTS.
APRICOTS?
WELL, FOR SOME REASON,
APRICOTS JUST SEEM TO WORK BEST.
[ Teakettle Whistling ]
HOW WE DOIN', LADIES?
BYE!
THANK YOU FOR THE LOVELY GIFT.
[ Henry ] LET'S DO IT AGAIN REAL SOON.
NICE FOLKS.
THEY SEEM CONTENT.
WELL...
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
LADY LOVE AN OUTLAW
LIKE A LITTLE BOY LOVE A STRAY DOG.
WE STILL HAVEN'T CLEANED UP THAT TABLE.
YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THEM CHAIRS OF YOURS.
PICKING THEM UP,
SETTING THEM DOWN THROUGH THE AIR.
WHY, IT'S POETRY.
I THINK I'M GETTING A HEADACHE.
PRETTY SOON--
ALL OVER AMERICA,
PEOPLE'S GOING TO BE PICKING UP CHAIRS
AND SETTING THEM DOWN.
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL YOUR DOING.
JULIA...
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TRY CANNING
SOME OF THEM APRICOTS?
[ Door Slams Shut ]
"IT WOULD BE LIKE A MAN HAULING WITH ONE OX
"""AND LOOKING FOR TWO,
"HOPING FOR THE HELP OF THE LORD.
"WHY NOT GET RID OF ALL THE OXEN
AND COUNT ON THE MAKER ALL THE WAY?"
VERY GOOD.
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING IT ON SUNDAY.
THANK YOU.
[ Henry ] MORNING, LADIES.
I SURE DID ENJOY THEM CANNED APRICOTS LAST NIGHT.
[ Julia ] YAH!
JULIA!
[ Braying ]
WHAT IN THE HELL WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?
A JOKE.
NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
A JOKE IS WHEN YOU MAKE SOMEBODY LAUGH.
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ Sneezes ]
MISS TATE, PLEASE STEP INTO THE OFFICE.
IT'S, UH, MRS. MOON.
EXCUSE ME.
MISS TATE--
WHY, YOU--
HENRY.
I BELIEVE THIS IS BETWEEN MR. POLTY AND MYSELF.
HEY, MOON!
IT LOOKS LIKE THE HONEYMOON IS OVER!
HA HA HA!
WHAT'S THE MATTER, MOON?
YOU'RE LOOKING LIKE A DOG WITHOUT A BONE.
HA HA HA!
HEY, HECTOR.
YEAH?
WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN
TO THE MEXICAN SIDE OF TOWN
AND SEE WHAT THE BEANS IS JUMPING ON.
BEANS?
BEANS.
[ Neighs ]
YOU KNOW...
POLTY'S JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR CHICKEN.
GOOD ONE, TOWFIELD.
WHO THOUGHT IT UP FOR YOU?
COME ON!
LET'S GO CHEW THE FAT.
WHAT FOR?
BECAUSE I'M IN A GOOD MOOD.
WELL...
THEN, UH,
HOW'S ABOUT A LITTLE SNORT?
?
[ Honky-Tonk ]
HEY, PEACHY.
BOTTLE OF MASH AND TWO GLASSES, NORVELL.
NOT FOR HIM.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOT FOR ME?
SHERIFF'S ORDERS.
THE SHERIFF DIDN'T TELL ME.
YOU DON'T TELL HIM NOTHING,
SO HE DON'T TELL YOU NOTHING.
THEM'S THE BREAKS.
AH!
YOU KNOW, I OWE YOU A SPECIAL THANKS.
WHAT FOR?
WHAT FOR?
HELL!
IF YOU HADN'T
JERKED ME BACK ACROSS THE BORDER
TO MY JUST DESERTS, SO TO SPEAK,
WHY, I'D NEVER HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO JULIA.
THINKING ON IT THAT WAY, WHY...
YOU SORT OF...
INTRODUCED US.
YEAH, TOWFIELD...
THINGS IS GOOD.
YOU HEARD ABOUT THEM MATCHES
MADE IN HEAVEN, DIDN'T YOU?
WELL, I'M IN ONE OF THEM.
GODDAMN IT, MOON!
YOU STOLE MY GIRL!
TAKE IT EASY, TOWFIELD.
YOU'RE WRINKLING MY GOOD-LUCK BANDANNA.
HOW'S THIS--
YOU GIVE ME THE BOTTLE,
AND I'LL, UH, I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
YOU MEAN YOU WAS JUST JAPIN' ME?
[ Sighs ]
SHE PUTS CHAIRS UP ON THE WALL
SO'S PEOPLE CAN'T SIT ON THEM.
WHAT?
I CAN'T GO INTO IT, TOWFIELD.
IT'S OVER YOUR HEAD.
BUT IT'S BAD, HUH?
LIKE EGGS ROLLED IN SAND.
TSK, TSK, TSK.
DUCK OUT BACK FOR A SNORT.
[ Man ] THE TROUBLE WITH ANDREW JOHNSON
IS HE'S A DAMN MUGWUMP.
OH, DON'T MENTION THAT SON-OF-A-BITCH'S NAME.
[ Horse Urinating ]
UGH!
[ Gunshot ]
[ Neighs ]
LISTEN,AMIGO.
I DON'T EVER WANT YOU TO CALL ME A BEAN AGAIN.
[ Glass Shattering ] [ Blows Landing ]
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
THIS IS AS DIFFICULT FOR ME AS IT IS FOR YOU, JULIA.
HA!
YOU KNOW, A YEAR AGO LAST CHRISTMAS EVE,
I HAD TO MOVE 150 COMANCHE SOULS
OFF THEIR SACRED BURIAL GROUND.
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY FELT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY?
YOU LOOK WHITER THAN AN ALBINO.
YOU BEEN BOTHERING MY WIFE?
WE HAVE 30 DAYS TO VACATE.
[ Gunfire ]
[ Yelling, Shouting ]
[ Henry ] WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.
IF IT CONCERNS HER, IT CONCERNS ME.
THE RAILROAD'S TAKING OVER MY LAND
UNDER EMINENT DOMAIN.
[ Woman ] CHESTER, COME ON!
EMINENT DOMAIN.
AIN'T THAT WHERE SOMEBODY BRIBES THE STATE LEGISLATURE
TO TAKE AWAY SOME POOR FOLKS' LAND?
I WON'T DIGNIFY THAT WITH AN ANSWER.
I AIN'T ASKIN' FOR NO DIGNIFICATION.
BUT I DO FIND IT INTERESTING
THAT YOU, UH, PREFER DOING BUSINESS
WITH THE LADY OF THE HOUSE.
COME ON, MOON.
I'M SORRY, JULIA,
BUT UNLESS I AM ADVISED OTHERWISE,
I'LL BE OUT TO SURVEY.
YOU KNOW...
POLTY'S JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING CHICKEN.
?
[ Julia Singing, Indistinct ]

THEY WORSHIP GOLD AND DROSS ?
?
THEY MAY BE OLD MAIDS ?
?
TILL THEY DIE ?

AND WILL NEVER FEEL THEIR LOSS ?

OH, GEORGE, PLEASE, GEORGE ?

OH, YES.

[ Muttering, Indistinct ]
OH, YES.
OH, OH.
I LOVE YOU!
[ Sneezes ]
WHO'S THERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH, JULIA!
I WAS JUST OUT HERE SURVEYING.
YOU LIAR!
YOU WERE SPYING ON ME!
ME?
I NEVER WOULD DO SUCH A THING.
HELP!
JULIA, I SWEAR ON MY HONOR
I DIDN'T SEE A THING!
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK!
YOU OLD--
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
NOTHING.
YOU BOTHERING MY WIFE AGAIN?
I WAS OUT SURVEYING.
THERE'S MY EQUIPMENT--
MY TRIPOD, MY MAPS, ET CETERA.
I CAUGHT YOU, DIDN'T I?
I SWEAR, NO.
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING.
THEN APOLOGIZE.
I APOLOGIZE.

NOW EMINENT DOMAIN YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE.
HA HA HA!
WOO, NASTY.
OOH!

WHAT'S THE MATTER?
NOTHING.
WHY'D YOU STOP LAUGHING?
I DON'T KNOW.
GET TO WORK.
I'D RATHER LAUGH.
THAT'S ALL YOU LIKE TO DO.
NO, THAT AIN'T ALL I LIKE TO DO.
UH-UH, MOON.
UH-HUH.
UH-UH.
UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.
[ Thunder Rumbling ] HA HA HA!
OOH!
NASTY!
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Thunder Continues ]
DAMN.
A NORTHER.
IT'S A NORTHER.
YEAH.
DID YOU GET STUNG?
YES.
DID YOU?
WHERE?
JULIA...
[ Henry's Voice Echoing ] AN OUTLAW DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.
[ Thunderclap ]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE?
HUH?
WHAT AM I DOING?
OH, I GUESS I WAS DREAMING
ABOUT A TUNNEL OR SOMETHING.
GET UP!
YOU GOT ME DRUNK.
I DON'T REMEMBER A THING!
I DIDN'T GET YOU DRUNK!
AAH!
I WILL NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF TALK IN MY HOUSE!
HEY!
YOU TRICKED ME!
[ Panting ]
I DIDN'T TRICK YOU.
YOU GET YOUR CLOTHES AND GET OUT!
THERE'S WORK TO DO!
OH.
I GET IT.
YOU'RE SO AFRAID THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LIKETHAT...
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FORGET ABOUT THE GOLD AND PHILADELPHIA!
YOU GET YOUR CLOTHES,
AND YOU GET OUT OF HERE!
SON-OF-A-BITCH!
I WAS RIGHT
ALL THESE YEARS!
THERE AIN'T A LADY THAT KNOWS HOW TO
APPRECIATE A MAN.
NO GODDAMN...
UNNATURAL QUESTIONS!
"HOW DID IT FEEL?"
DAMN IT!
I FEEL SORRY FOR THE POOR SON-OF-A-BITCH THAT,
SON-OF-A-BITCH THAT WINDS UP WITH YOU!
NICE BEING MARRIED TO YOU!
[ Thunder Continues ]
UGH!
UH!
OH!
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A PLUGGED NICKEL!
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GOT A GUN!
YEAH!
UH!
YOU WON'T GET 20 MILES
BEFORE A POSSE WILL COME AND GET YOU
AND STRING YOU UP!
THE ONLY REASON WHY I SLEPT WITH YOU
WAS SO YOU'D KEEP ON WORKING!
I HOPE THEY HANG YOU!
YOU...
OH!
[ Clucking ]
NOT THE CURTAIN!
YOU WOULDN'T DARE!
WELL...
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT,
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
UP IN SAN FRANCISCO,
I SEEN SOME CHINESE THAT DONE IT THIS WAY.
THE CHINESE IS AN OLD CIVILIZATION.
THEY UNDERSTAND THINGS ABOUT PLEASURE THAT,
I'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF.
ONE THING FOR SURE...
WE AIN'T HAD A BORING MARRIAGE.
?
[ Men Singing, Indistinct ]
[ Man ] DEPUTY, HOW CAN YOU DO A THING LIKE THIS?
BUT 15 DAYS?
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
TELL IT TO THE RAILROAD.
WE'VE BEEN HERE SINCE '43.
WELL, THEM'S THE BREAKS.
[ Hector ] COME ON!
[ Spits ]
DAMN BLACK GOO!
GIDDY-UP!
HYAH!
HYAH!
GIDDY-UP!
HUH!
WELL...
I WAS JUST GOING INTO TOWN TO...
BUY AN ANVIL.
[ Knocking ]
JULIA?
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
LET'S NOT HAVE NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS.
UH, ME AND THE LITTLE WOMAN
HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ALONG OF LATE.
DON'T GO IN THERE!
OH!
JULIA?
JULIA?
[ Julia ] WHERE'S THE DOCTOR?
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DEAR?
WHERE'S THE DOCTOR?
DOCTOR...
OH, YEAH.
UH, I NEVER DID GET OVER THERE.
THIS PEA BRAIN GRABBED ME
AND STUCK ME IN AN ANIMAL WAGON.
IT WOULD HAVE BROKE YOUR HEART TO SEE IT, HONEY.
YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT NO DOCTOR.
YOU NEVER ASKED ME ABOUT NO DOCTOR.
IS SOMETHING WRONG, JULIA?
FEMALE TROUBLE.
OH...
THE VAPORS.
[ Henry ] I BETTER PUT YOU TO BED, DARLING.
I JUST GOT OUT OF BED, DARLING.
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU PICK HIM UP FOR, TOWFIELD?
HE WAS DRESSED UP LIKE A MEXICAN.
YOU CAN'T ARREST A MAN FOR THAT.
I TOLD HIM.
WELL...
LET'S LEAVE THESE TWO LOVEBIRDS ALONE.
JULIA.
I TOLD HIM.
I TOLD YOU, BUT, NO, YOU WOULD--
[ Hoofbeats Departing ]
[ Door Closes ]
YOU MISSED ME, DIDN'T YOU?
I DID NOT.
YEAH.
I CAN SEE IT.
THEM EYES AIN'T ANGRY.
THEY'RE RELIEVED,
AND THEY AIN'T BLOODSHOT NO MORE.
I WANTED YOU BACK FOR ONE REASON--
TO WORK THE MINE.
NAW.
YOU MISSED THE OLD MAN IN THE MOON.
HA HA HA!
HELL, I GOT MY FAULTS.
I ADMIT IT, BUT...
AW, HELL, I GOT MY WAYS, TOO.
YEAH, I...
I MISSED YOU A LITTLE BIT, TOO.
I DID.
WHEN I WAS HEADING FOR THE BORDER,
I COULDN'T STOP BUT THINKING
NOBODY'S EVER SAVED MY LIFE BEFORE.
AND I JUST COULDN'T LEAVE YOU
IN YOUR TIME OF NEED
OF ME.
[ Laughing ]
IT'S BEEN QUITE A DAY.
I'M A BIT TUCKERED OUT.
I THINK I'LL TAKE A POCA SIESTA.
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SLEEP IN THE BARN.
YOU CAN SLEEP ON THE COUCH.
SAY WHEN.
WHEN.
[ Bats Screeching ]
BATS.
[ Groaning ]
[ Rumbling ]
[ Boards Creaking ]
[ Coughing ]
THAT'S IT FOR ME.
I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND ABOUT DREAMS.
I UNDERSTAND ABOUT WAKING UP, TOO.
DIDN'T I WANT TO RIDE
WITH THE YOUNGER GANG,
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ME?
CLAIMED I WASN'T CUT OUT TO BE A YOUNGER.
MY FEELINGS WAS HURT,
BUT I ACCEPTED IT.
YOU KNOW, FOR AN OUTLAW,
YOU'VE BEEN A PRETTY GOOD FRIEND.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
GOLD!
GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY, I'VE FOUND GOLD!
GOLD!
[ Creaking ]
WATCH OUT.
DON'T KNOCK INTO NONE OF THESE BEAMS.
I BEEN HERE.
I KNOW IT'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERES.
I CAN FEEL IT!
I DON'T SEE NOTHING.
IT'S HERE.
BELIEVE ME.
IT'S HERE.
WHERE?
[ Creaking ]
GODDAMN!
HA HA HA!
GOLD.
LOOK AT THAT!
GOLD!
OH!
GOLD!
GODDAMN, IT'S ALL OVER EVERYTHING.
I TOLD YOU.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
OH, HONEY, KISS ME.
I'M RICH.
GODDAMN, I AM RICH.
I KNEW IT.
YOU WAIT LONG ENOUGH,
AND PRETTY SOON, DOWN IT'S GOING TO COME
RIGHT ON YOU.
LIKE A WALL FULL OF MEXICAN TEETH.
YOU KNOW,
I'M GOING TO GET MY INITIALS PUT ON MY SADDLE,
IN GOLD.
THEY LIKE IT THAT WAY IN MEXICO.
ALLS WE GOT TO DO NOW IS...
DEPOSIT THIS FIRST BUNCH IN THE BANK AND THEN--
"WE"?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WE"?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WELL, JUST THAT, IN ALL FAIRNESS,
I PLAYED A PART IN STRIKING THE GOLD.
YOU NEVER BELIEVED IT EXISTED.
BUT YOU'D HAVE NEVER STRUCK IT
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME.
CORRECTO?
SO?
SO...
HA HA!
WHERE'S MY-- WHERE'S MY SHARE IN THE STAKE?
HA HA!
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE YOU 10%.
HA HA HA!
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU SEE, SHARING IS GIVINGTO EACH OTHER.
50%.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.
OH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
UH, 25%,
AND WE CAN...
STOP THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT HERE.
MUST BE FUNNY ACTUALLY DEPOSITING SOMETHING
IN A BANK, HUH, MOON?
YEAH!
IT'S A WHOLE NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
THAT'S IT.
SURE ARE SORRY
TO HAVE YOU AND MIRIAM LEAVING US.
THANK YOU, MRS. HABER,
BUT WITH THE RAILROAD
AND THIS BLACK STUFF SPRINGING UP EVERYWHERES,
A MAN JUST CAN'T GROW A DECENT EAR OF CORN.
OHHH!
AWFUL HEAVY FOR FIGURINES.
IT'S MY WHOLE COLLECTION.
WELL, I'LL GUARD IT WITH MY LIFE.
AW, YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT, WHITEY.
[ Laughing ]
HENRY LLOYD MOON AT THE BANK.

I LIKE BEING RICH.
MAYBE NOW YOU CAN BUY YOUR WAY
INTO THE YOUNGER GANG.

TIME TO START LIVING THE GOOD LIFE.
GODDAMN IT, HONEY, I'M GOING TO BE APATRON.
TEQUILA...

"BUENAS NOCHES, SENOR MOON.
COMO ESTA USTED, SENOR MOON?"
"MUY BIEN, GRACIAS.

[ Owl Hooting ]
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TRY IT.
YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING FOOLISH?
THAT'S FOOLISH.
50%?
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME... 50%?
WE'RE PARTNERS, AREN'T WE?
WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT THAT WAY.

HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
TOOTH FAIRY!
YOU WON'T GET NOTHING FOR HIS MOLAR.
[ Julia ] WELL, COME ON, BOYS.
LET'S HELP BIG ABE FIND HIS GODDAMN MOLAR.
NO!
WAIT!
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.
MOON, LET'S YOU AND ME GO BUY BIG ABE
A WHOLE DAMN SET OF GOLD TEETH!
HA HA!
[ Whispering ] YOU'LL RUIN EVERYTHING ACTING LIKE A GODDAMN FOOL.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT ANYBODY SAYS!
I'M A GENTLEMAN!
[ Blows Raspberry ]
AND I'M NOT GOING TO THROW UP
IN THIS HERE HOUSE.
I'M GOING OUTSIDE TO THROW UP
'CAUSE I--I RESPECT YOUR HOUSE.
UM...
BIG ABE,
YOU CAN THROW UP IN THIS HOUSE
ANY OLD TIME.
HA HA HA!
GODDAMN GOLD!
GOLD!
THAT SON-OF-A-BITCH IS KEEPING GOLD FROM US.
GOD ALMIGHTY.
SON-OF-A-BITCH.
[ Hoofbeats Departing ]
[ Footsteps ]
YOU ALMOST SPILLED THE BEANS.
COME ON AND HELP ME FIND BIG ABE'S MOLAR.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
TO WATCH WHAT YOU WAS DOING?
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND OUTLAWS!
I UNDERSTOODYOU
WHEN YOU TOLD ME TO ACT FOOLISH.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO GET DRUNK
AND START SINGING YOUR DAMN FOOL HEAD OFF!
HOG LIKED MY SINGING.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL HIM HOG!
[ Door Slams Shut ]
[ Hermine ] A-WOO!
[ Henry Howling ]
A-WOO!
[ Coyotes Howling ]
AAH!
DAMN, HERMINE.
QUIT YOUR GODDAMN COYOTE CALLING.
I'M HERE.
YOUR WIFE'S ACTING TERRIBLE, AIN'T SHE?
SHE JUST HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH BUG-JUICE.
HA HA HA!
I FIGURE YOU AIN'T HAD MUCH OF ANYTHING
OF ANYTHING IN A LONG TIME.
HOW'S COME YOU AND THE BOYS
DECIDED TO STOP BY TONIGHT?
I WANT TO MAKE IT GOOD FOR YOU, HENRY.
HONEY, YOU AIN'T HEARING WHAT I'M ASKING.
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.
I APPRECIATE THE COYOTE CALLING,
BUT I TOLD YOU THINGS HAS CHANGED.
CRAWL IN, HENRY.
SEE WHAT I GOT.
HERMINE, YOU AIN'T HEARING ME.
I SEEN WHAT YOU GOT.
IT WAS SWELL.
WE HAD SOME TIMES TOGETHER
THAT I'LL NEVER FORGET.
BUT, HERMINE, NOW I'M TOOK.
HENRY.
AAH!
[ Coyote Howling ]
[ Julia ] HOLD IT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
UH...
DON'T SHOOT.
VAMOOSE.
WELL...
IF I WAS MONKEYING AROUND,
WOULD I STILL HAVE MY CLOTHES ON?
THEN WHY DID YOU GO OUT THERE?
DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE.
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY, YOU AIN'T GOING TO BELIEVE ME.
GO AHEAD.
WELL, I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET INFORMATION
OFF OF HERMINE.
THAT WASN'T ALL YOU WERE TRYING TO GET OFF OF HER.
ALL I WANTED TO KNOW
WAS IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GOLD.
YOU CARE MORE ABOUT THAT DAMN GOLD THAN ABOUT ME.
THAT AIN'T TRUE.
I COULD HAVE DONE WHAT YOU THINK, BUT I DIDN'T.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T.
I WAS THERE STRICTLY ON BUSINESS.
YOU WANT THAT WOMAN!
YOU TAKE HER,
BUT YOU FORGET ALL ABOUT THE GOLD.
PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD BUSINESS PARTNERS THAT CHEAT ON THEM.
WE MADE AN AGREEMENT.
AND I'M BREAKING IT.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO ME.
I JUST DID.
THAT TEARS IT.
GOING TO PUT THE OLD DOUBLE "X" TO HENRY MOON, HUH?
WELL, WE'LL SEE.
YOU WANT YOUR GUN BACK, MOON?
WHERE'S THE GODDAMN GOLD?
WHAT GOLD?
THAT GOLD THERE.
THAT'S REAL GOLD!
WHERE IS IT?
YOU AIN'T AS IGNORANT AS YOU LOOK, ARE YOU?
COME ON IN.
HOW MUCH WE GOT HERE?
ENOUGH.
IN FACT, I WAS JUST COMING LOOKING FOR YOU BOYS.
SURE, YOU WAS.
WE'RE GOING TO HIT THE LONGHORN BANK.
THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN THAT CHICKEN-FEED BANK
BUT SUN-FILLED WINDOWS.
AND ALL THE LITTLE LADY'S GOLD.
LET'S HIT HER IN THE MORNING.
NOT YET.
GOT A PLAN?
I'M GOING TO MAKE THAT WOMAN
SORRY SHE EVER SAID, "I DO."
I TELL YOU, HE'S HIDING SOMETHING FROM US.
[ Coogan ] I DON'T THINK SO.
I KNOW SO.
[ Hog ] I WAS CERTAIN HE HAD A PLAN.
ME, TOO, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN IT.
LET'S KEEP A WATCH ON THE SON-OF-A-BITCH.
[ Abe ] COME ON, GANG!
YOU...
YOU BETTER TAKE A REST BEFORE YOUR ARM FALLS OFF.
YOU WANT SOME WATER?
ARE YOU ALWAYS THIS QUIET?
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY.
[ Creaking ]
I KEEP MY WORD.
[ Explosion ]
[ Henry ] JULIA!
[ Rocks Falling ]
HONEY!
MOON!
HONEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
GODDAMN!
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YES.
OH!
ALL RIGHT.
[ Creaking ]
CAN YOU STAND THERE?
YES.
O.K. ALL RIGHT.
[ Rumbling ]
[ Julia Screaming ]
YOU ALL RIGHT?
WELL, I'VE BEEN BETTER.
[ Creaking ]
EASY.
EASY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.
HERE, HOLD THIS.
YOU STAY RIGHT HERE.
WHEN I GET BACK, WE'LL TAKE US A LITTLE SPANISH PAUSE.
[ Creaking ]
HENRY LLOYD?
[ Henry ] WHAT?
NOTHING.
I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
I KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER, BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO DIE,
I--I WANT IT TO BE AS PARTNERS.
50/50.
WE WAS A GOOD TEAM.
GOOD?
SHIT.
WE WERE THE BEST.
HONEY PIE...
MOON, I'VE BEEN THINKING.
SINCE WE'RE GOING TO GO ANYWAY,
WHY DON'T WE GO OUT IN A BLAZE OF GLORY?
MOON, TIE ME UP.
JULIA...
WE'RE ALIVE.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU, HENRY.
FIGURED.
AIN'T YOU UP EARLY?
WE DON'T HIT THE BANK TILL 10:00.
WELL, THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE CHANGE IN PLANS.
WELL, I GOT TO TELL BIG ABE.
YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU, HERMINE.
YOU WAS THE FIRST WOMAN
I DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR.
ADIOS.
[ Knocks On Door ]
YOU'RE A MITE EARLY, COMPADRE.
I WANT TO MAKE A WITHDRAWAL.
YOUR BETTER HALF HAS TO DO THAT.
ORDINANCE HUSBANDS AREN'T ALLOWED TO MAKE WITHDRAWALS.
BESIDES, WE'RE CLOSED.
YOU'RE OPEN NOW.
OPEN IT UP.
OVER THERE IN THE BIN.
HURRY UP, WHITEY.
I NEVER FIGURED YOU'D DO THIS TO JULIA.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE MY MARRIAGE, WHITEY.
HYAH!
JULIA!
JULIA?
GROVER, WHERE IS JULIA AT?
JULIA!
GODDAMN.
ROCKS.
GODDAMN, HONEY PIE.
FREEZE, MOON!
MR. MOON, YOU'RE STILL HERE.
WHERE'S JULIA?
I GUESS HE AIN'T HEARD THE NEWS.
HA HA HA!
WHAT NEWS?
YOUR WIFE SOLD HER PROPERTY TO THE RAILROAD.
GENTLEMEN, START TAGGING THE FURNITURE.
WHEN?
DOES THAT CONCERN YOU NOW?
WHERE IS SHE?
I BELIEVE ON HER WAY TO PHILADELPHIA.
AND YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO MEET SAINT PETER.
THAT'S RIGHT, MOON.
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO MEET SENOR PETER.
[ Gunfire ]
COME OUT, MOON.
WE KNOW YOU GOT IT!
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING!
WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU!
HENRY, WHO THE HELL IS THAT?
THE EX-MOON GANG.
i¡¡CHINGA LA LUNA!
IF THEY WANT A GUNFIGHT,
THEY PICKED THE WRONG HOMBRES TO MESS WITH!
GODDAMN YOU!
WATCH IT, BIG ABE!
OK. 1, 2, 3!
WHEN DID SHE LEAVE?
WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU?
ABOUT A HALF-HOUR AGO.
NOW!
MOON.
SHOOT BACK.
YES, SIR, THIS IS MIGHTY STRANGE STUFF.
MURIEL DROPPED A LANTERN
IN A PUDDLE OF IT THE OTHER NIGHT,
AND THE WHOLE FARM 'BOUT NEAR WENT UP IN FLAME!
BURNED HALF THE HAIR OFF OF MY HEAD.
STUNK FOR TWO WEEKS.
THE RAILROAD SAID THEY'VE GOT NO USE FOR IT,
SO I THOUGHT I'D TAKE SAMPLES BACK EAST
AND MAYBE SELL IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MISS JULIA?
OH, I'M SORRY, MR. STANDARD.
I DIDN'T HEAR WHAT YOU SAID.
[ Gunshot ]
HYAH!
AAH!
WHOA IN THERE!
WHOA!
WHOA.
HOLD UP IN THERE.
ALL RIGHT.
STAY CALM.
WHOA.
WHOA.
ALL RIGHT.
STEP DOWN, JULIA.
WHOA.
COTTON, THAT SON-OF- A-BITCH CAN SHOOT.
HE RODE WITH QUANTRELL.
COME ON, YOU'VE RUN FAR ENOUGH.
COME ON, NOW.
I'M LOSING MY PATIENCE.
YOU AIN'T TAKING MY GOLD!
THEY DISCOVERED GOLD!
NAH.
THEY HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH BUG-JUICE.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN WRITE A NOTE WHEN YOU LEFT.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO WRITE?
"GOOD LUCK, HENRY AND HERMINE"?
I WAS GOING TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.
SEE, I--
[ Sheriff Kyle ] MR. MOON.
ARE YOU ROBBING THIS STAGE OR NOT?
BURN THE BREEZE, KYLE,
OR I'LL BLOW EVERYBODY INTO FEATHERS.
WE DON'T DESERT OUR WOMEN OUT HERE, MR. MOON.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SHERIFF.
YOU GO ON AHEAD.
HE'S JUST TRYING TO IMPRESS ME.
[ Sheriff Kyle ] ARE YOU SURE, JULIA?
OH.
WELL...
YOU TWO OUGHT TO TRY AND GET ALONG, THEN.
WE ALL HAD TO.
HYAH!
MY HEART FROZE WHEN I CAME HOME
AND YOU WAS GONE, HONEY.
LET ME HELP YOU UP.
OH!
THANK YOU, MOON.
I'M NOT SURE I'LL EVER GET USED TO MEXICO.
WHY, SURE, YOU WILL, HONEY PIE.
YOU GOT USED TO ME, DIDN'T YOU?
ANYWAYS...
FIRST, LET'S GET USED TO BEING RICH.
Oh, you, Rio Grande!
Get in there!
Come on, Speed!
This here's Mexican dirt!
You can't touch me!
You thought you'd get the old man in the moon.
You Texas clodbusters is a disgrace to the Confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down.
Get up!
Come on, Speed!
Goddamn it, Speed!
You can't do this!
This is Mexican territory!
I don't believe it!
He cross the Grande river and his horse faints on him!
I can't believe it!
It's a goddamn foreign country here!
This ain't fair, goddamn it!
This ain't fair!
This ain't fair!
Good Lord.
They're stringing up old Speed.
I have here a very fine animal... once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey!
I still own that horse!
When we want to hear from you, amigo... we'll rattle your cage.
Is that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted, but he got up, didn't he?
What?
What?
Towfield, I told you to keep these buzzards out of here!
Take it easy, Moon.
You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just wanted to take a gander at the man of the hour.
Yeah.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card, Moon.
I'm gonna miss ya.
Your family's here.
Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe.
Jimmy, Gussie and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy.
He thought you was really my family.
That's how I figured.
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
How ya doing, Henry?
Well... roll it out.
Nothing like that, Henry.
We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too good on your own, Henry, did you?
You should've stuck with us, 'cause we was going places, goddamn it.
What do you mean "was"?
All you gotta do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get ourselves--
Yeah, but that's without my plans.
Cut that out.
Big Abe, they're gonna send me to the bone orchard.
If you got anything you wanna give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your good-byes, boys.
Nice knowing you.
Yeah, Coogan, sure.
It just ain't right.
Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
- Law's gotta be changed.
- Yeah.
Go on outside.
So long, Moon.
Well, honey...
Least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had.
Except maybe that circus feller.
Why does that always upset you so?
What did you bring a thing like that up... at a time like this for, Hermine?
Shit!
Oh, Henry!
Oh, Abe!
Don't you worry none, Moon.
I'm gonna take care of this girl like she's my very own.
Come on, now.
Oh, Henry!
Mr. Moon?
It's about that time.
What about my last meal?
You're smoking it.
Hands behind your back, Mr. Moon.
He ain't for you, Serene.
I wouldn't take you to a dogfight... if you was the defending champ.
You oughtn't have done that, Mr. Moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
You tell him about the ordinance?
No.
Why not?
I don't like him... and people I don't like, I don't tell nothing.
Goddamn it, Towfield.
What ordinance?
What ordinance?
Sheriff Pile?
Kyle.
We got this ordinance here that was passed after the Civil War... account a lot of our boys didn't come home... and women was beginning to chew up the grass.
I feel sorry for the grass.
I feel sorry for the women.
Anyhow, this ordinance states that any man short of being a murderer... can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female... providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, too, as I recollect.
Sweet Jesus H. Christ almighty!
Ma'am?
I think there's a couple of things about me... that I'd like for you to consider.
I don't need your insults.
I agree with you completely... but you gotta take into consideration... that a man can get a little irritated... and he can act like the dickens... when he's about to pull hemp.
Buzzards, huh?
Well, buzzards can fly.
And they keep the desert clean!
I cook!
I cook like a son of a bitch!
I mean, like the dickens!
- Hello, son.
- Go to hell.
I understand.
Henry Lloyd Moon... you've been found guilty of horse thievery... and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this.
I wanna tell you good people of Longhorn... especially you lovely ladies... that the old saying...
"You can't judge a book by it's cover"-- it's true.
It's true.
Some books is all... scruffed up on the outside... but when you turn around and look inside... why, the words is just... wonderful.
Is that it, Moon?
Well, isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul."
That's not right.
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--"
I'm a veteran of the great Civil War!
"For thou art with me."
The only reason why I turned to crime... is there wasn't no jobs!
Not one single job for a man who risked his life... for this great country...
- "Thou anointest my head with oil." - and the Confederacy!
This one's dumb.
He'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
Bullshit!
He's ready to go!
Stop!
- I'll take him.
- Her again?
Florence.
Now--
Don't you think that you're... a mite too elderly to be taking on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran.
He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this sumbitchin' blindfold off me... and let me see my bride!
Where is she?
Florence!
Mrs. Henry Moon...
Let me look at you!
- Stand back, folks.
- Florence.
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
I think I made her dizzy.
Down she go.
Up you go!
Is she dead?
At least she died happy.
Then I'll take him.
Julia, what are you saying?
He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you were hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff Kyle, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink!
You want him?
According to the law, I can claim him, right?
I asked you out ten times.
What did I get?
A flap of your umbrella.
Shit!
All right.
Okay, Julia.
Mr. Moon... what do you say?
Well...
I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off... but what the hell.
Fine by me.
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't taking Frank Towfield's business tonight.
Somebody's taking it... or we ain't got no business.
Now, Mr. Moon, no drinking... no gambling, no wife-beating... no alley-catting, whatnot nor what have you.
You got to mind her... and if you try running, there will be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you.
Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
See?
I told you he had a plan.
You'll dance in the air, you son of a bitch-- stealing my girl.
Miss... in case you wanna know who you're dealing with...
I used to ride with Quantrill's Raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well, look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
Of course, a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find.
You were standing in front of the whole town... with a rope around your neck.
Yeah.
You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
I'm sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, Rover.
- That's Grover.
- Hey, Grover.
This is where I live.
Well, Julia, it ain't much... but it's a start.
Well, I guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
It looks like an opera house.
Please take your clothes off, Mr. Moon.
Take your clothes off, Mr. Moon.
Don't sit there.
Here.
Put these on.
These is--
These is work clothes.
That's right.
Well, I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine?
- In Texas?
- It's gonna be.
Looks like mice been into it.
First you'll begin crevicing.
Then crosscut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Then you insert the drill...
Like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blisters easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Mr. Moon--
Pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck... so let's not waste any more time.
I'll do all I can do... but that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How did you come in to this place?
It was my father's.
He believe in this gold mine?
He believed but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
How's about a little dessert?
Said...
"How's about a little dessert?"
I heard you the first time.
You didn't answer me the first time.
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time that you had a man?
I hope you don't mind working in confined spaces... because tomorrow we start tunneling.
Goddamn!
I should've knowed.
You can always tell a virgin on account of... the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
See, I got this theory on virgins... that they're always looking peaked and grouchy... on account of they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back... but in my time...
I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Listen to me.
Don't let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is--
I'll be outside in the barn... if you feel like getting acquainted or... talking about tunneling.
And remember.
Nature is the great provider.
Goddamn.
Good morning, Spot.
Get you some bacon?
Morning, Miss!
What's for breakfast?
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me.
I know how to pace myself.
If I want to...
I can do this all day long!
I'm talking about... all day long!
Pace myself.
Where are you going?
I want to... take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacing yourself.
You just go on trimming your wicks.
'Cause I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long!
All day long!
Hey, lady!
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
An awful lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the City of Motherly Love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
To Philadelphia?
Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
Pace suits me better.
Slow days and fast nights.
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw the lights and felt we wouldn't be intruding.
Oh, Lorette, you're never intruding.
Y'all remember my husband, Henry?
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought along a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
I'll get us some tea.
- Shall I help?
- We'll help.
Don't be long now.
We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to... especially now.
Look, honey, what Lorette's trying to say... is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Since you've never been married before... we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or Lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, Lorette.
You know, I rode with Quantrill.
Finest revolver gang in history till he died.
Quantrill died?
Last year.
That Shorty, he don't even ask.
He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night, he got all painted up like an Indian... and did he go on the warpath!
Mary!
Say, wanna have yourself a really wild time?
Why don't you dress up like an Indian?
Well, that sounds like it ought to be Julia's cup of tea.
I guess I'll go on out... and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is... it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
But if it should become one...
I have found... that the best thing to do... is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
How we doing, ladies?
- Bye.
- Bye.
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Let's do it again real soon!
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well... you know what they say:
"Lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog."
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know, I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air... why, it's poetry.
I think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon all over America... people's gonna be picking up chairs... and setting them down.
It's gonna be all your doing.
Julia... what do you say we try canning some of them apricots.
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox... and looking for two, hoping for the help of the Lord.
Why not get rid of all the oxen... and count on the Maker all the way?"
Very good.
I look forward to hearing it on Sunday.
Thank you.
Morning, ladies!
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night!
What in the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke?
No, you don't understand.
A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Miss Tate, please step into the office.
It's Mrs. Moon.
Excuse me.
- Miss Tate--
- Why, you--
Henry.
I believe this is between Mr. Polty and myself.
Hey, Moon!
It looks like the honeymoon is over!
What's the matter, Moon?
You're looking like a dog without a bone!
Hey, Hector.
Why don't you go down the Mexican side of town... see what the beans is jumping on.
"Beans"?
Beans.
You know, Polty's just another word for "chicken."
Good one, Towfield.
- Who thought it up for you?
- Come on!
Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
'Cause I'm in a good mood.
Well... then how's about a little snort?
Hey, Peachy.
Bottle of mash, two glasses, Norvell.
Not for him.
What do you mean, not for me?
Sheriff's orders.
Sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks.
You know...
I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for?
Hell!
If you hadn't jerked me back across the border... to my just desserts, so to speak... why, I'd never been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why... you sorta... introduced us.
Yeah, Towfield.
Things is good.
You heard about them matches made in heaven, didn't you?
Well, I met one of 'em!
Goddamn it, Moon!
You stole my girl!
Take it easy, Towfield.
You're a-wrinkling my good luck bandanna.
How's this?
You give me the bottle, and I'll--
I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
She puts chairs up on the wall... so's people can't set on 'em.
What?
I can't go into it, Towfield.
It's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Duck out back for a snort.
The trouble with Andrew Johnson is he's a damn mugwump.
Don't mention that son of a bitch's name to me.
Listen, amigo.
I don't ever want you to call me a bean again.
What the hell was that?
This is as difficult for me as it is for you, Julia.
Do you know, a year ago last Christmas Eve...
I had to move 150 Comanche souls... off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey?
You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
- What do you mean?
- This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it concerns me.
The railroad is taking over my land under eminent domain.
Chester, come on!
Eminent domain.
Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature... to take away some poor folks' land?
I won't dignify that with an answer.
I ain't asking for no dignification.
But I do finding it interesting that you... prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, Moon.
I'm sorry, Julia... but unless I am advised otherwise...
I'll be out to survey.
You know...
Polty's just another way of saying "chicken."
Whoa.
Whoa.
Oh, give me the girl
Who loves a man
And loves him for himself
Who's first consideration
Is not his strength and pelf
All sordid-minded damsels...
May worship golden dross
They may be old maids till they die
- And will never feel their loss
- Lovely.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Mother says I mustn't
Oh, George, please, George
- Not just yet
- Oh, yes.
Swim.
- Oh, Mother says I mustn't
- Swim.
Be naked.
- Mother says I mustn't
- Oh, yes.
Oh, George, please, George
Oh, I love you!
Who's there?
What are you doing?
Oh, Julia!
I was just out here surveying.
You liar!
You were spying on me!
Me?
I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia.
I swear on my honor.
- I didn't see a thing.
- Help!
It's not what you think!
- You old--
- What's going on here?
Nothing.
You bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying.
There's my equipment.
My tripod, my maps, et cetera.
- See?
- I caught you, didn't I?
I swear.
No.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then apologize.
- I apologize.
- All right.
Now eminent domain your ass out of here!
- Ooh, nasty!
- Weasel!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know.
Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
- That's all you like to do.
- No.
That ain't all I like to do.
Uh-uh, Moon.
Ooh!
Nasty!
Damn.
A norther.
- It's a norther.
- Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Outlaw don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
What am I doing?
I guess I was dreaming about the tunnel or something.
- Get down!
- "Get down"?
You got me drunk!
I don't remember a thing!
I didn't get you drunk!
I will not that kind of talk in my house!
- Hey!
- You tricked me!
I didn't trick you.
You get your clothes and get out!
There's work to do!
Oh.
I get it.
You're so afraid that you're gonna like that... that you're gonna forget about the gold and Philadelphia!
You get your clothes and you get out of here!
Son of a bitch!
I was right all these years!
Them painted ladies knows how to... appreciate a man.
There's no goddamn unnatural questions!
"How did it feel?"
Damn it!
I feel sorry... for the poor sumbitchin' son of a bitch that winds up with you!
Nice being married to you!
You haven't got a plug nickel!
- Come on!
- You haven't even got a gun!
You won't even get 20 miles before a posse will come and get you... and string you up!
The only reason why I slept with you is so you'd keep on working!
I hope they hang you!
Not the curtain!
You wouldn't dare!
Well...
I hadn't thought of it.
But now that you mention it... up in San Francisco...
I seen some Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilization.
They understand things about pleasure that...
I've never even thought of.
One thing for sure.
We ain't had a boring marriage.
Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
But 15 days?
- That's not fair.
- Tell it to the railroad.
We've been here since '43.
- Well, them's the breaks.
- Come on.
Damn black goo!
I was just going into town to... buy an anvil.
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Me and the little woman haven't been getting along of late.
Don't go in there!
Where's the doctor?
What's the matter, dear?
Where's the doctor?
Doctor.
Oh, yeah.
I never did get over there.
This pea-brain grabbed me and stuck me in an animal wagon.
It would have broke your heart to see it, honey.
You never told me about no doctor.
You never asked me about no doctor.
Is something wrong, Julia?
Female trouble.
Oh.
The vapors.
I better put you to bed, darling.
I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell did you pick him up for, Towfield?
- He was dressed up like a Mexican.
- You can't arrest a man for that.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
I told him.
I told you, but, no, you wouldn't--
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not.
Yeah.
I can see it.
Them eyes ain't angry.
They're relieved... and they ain't bloodshot no more.
I wanted you back for one reason-- to work the mine.
You missed the old man in the moon.
Hell, I got my faults, I admit it, but... well, hell, I got my ways too.
Yeah, I--
I missed you a little bit too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border...
I couldn't stop but thinking that... nobody's ever saved my life before.
And I just couldn't leave you in your time of need of me.
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out.
I think I'll take a siesta.
You don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
Bats.
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up too.
Didn't I want to ride with the Younger gang... and they wouldn't have me?
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a Younger.
My feelings was hurt... but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw, you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good Lord Almighty, I've found gold!
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I been here.
I know it's around here somewhere.
- I can feel it!
- I don't see nothing.
- It's here.
- Where?
- Believe me, it's here.
- Where?
Goddamn!
Look at that!
Gold!
Goddamn, it's all over everything.
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, honey, kiss me.
I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich.
I knew it.
You wait long enough, and pretty soon... down it's going to come right on you.
Looks like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know, I'm gonna get my initials put on my saddle... in gold.
They like it that way down there in Mexico.
Alls we gotta do now is... deposit this first bunch in the bank and then--
"We"?
What do you mean, "we"?
What are you saying?
Well, just that in all fairness, I played a part... in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd have never struck it if it wasn't for me.
Correcto?
So?
So, where's my--
Where's my share of the stake?
You're right.
I'll give you ten percent.
You don't understand.
You see... sharing is giving to each other.
Fifty percent.
We'll talk about it later.
All right, all right.
Twenty-five percent, and we can... stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny actually depositing something in a bank, huh, Moon?
Yeah.
It's a whole new experience for me.
That's it.
Sure are sorry to have you and Miriam leaving us.
Thank you, Mrs. Haber, but with the railroad... and this black stuff springing up everywheres... a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
Well, I'll guard it with my life.
You can do better than that, Whitey.
Henry Lloyd Moon at the bank.
Want one of these?
Sure.
Goddamn it.
I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the Younger gang.
Doll...
I think I'll buy me a little cantina... south of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey, I'm gonna be a patron.
Tequila, cards... senoritas.
Wait till the Domingi sisters get a load of me!
Don't do that.
You're acting foolish.
Maybe you ought to try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
Fifty percent?
You're going to give me... fifty percent?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're going to put it that way... yeah.
I don't know how to... say this, Henry... but...
I think I got... greedy and selfish...
Living alone so long.
Well... that's how you get.
Once you get started... you don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
- Friends of yours?
- Used to be.
- What are they doing here?
- Good question.
Well!
Sorry to keep you all waiting, but... me and the missus was just playing a little game of fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree, Moon.
Oh, did you?
Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was... gonna have you all out.
Well, you damn sure got your wish, didn't you?
I damn sure did.
Ain't you gonna ask us in, Henry?
Why, sure, honey pie.
Don't you boys know how to wipe your feet?
Hey, Hog Coogan!
Wipe your feet off.
Hope you like taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me Big Abe.
Old Henry still snore in his sleep?
I want them out of here!
Not as much as I do.
You want them to find out about the dust?
Well!
- Anybody hungry?
- Hungry?
Shit.
I could eat a frozen dog.
We'll go on out to the kitchen and see if we got one already froze.
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
- A feast fit for a king.
- That's his speciality.
Them female bull feathers make it tasty.
Did you know that old Henry used to cook for the Raiders?
He cooked for Quantrill's Raiders?
No, he never told me that.
I bet there's a lot of things he never told you.
Shit, Hog!
Goddamn, Abe.
- Jesus Christ!
- You loosened my molar up!
Grab your girl Now pull on her mane
Just play along a little while longer.
Well, you go on ahead.
I don't want to spoil your fun.
I ain't having a good time.
I swear I ain't.
I'm just trying to throw them off the track.
They wouldn't know it was me if I wasn't acting wild and--
Forget about all this and get in there and have a good time.
Act foolish!
Beautiful dreamer
Awaken to me
Beautiful dreamer
Waken to me
Starlight and dewdrops are waitin' for thee
Ah, shit.
This ain't no real marriage.
Come on.
Meet me tonight, huh?
I'll give you my old coyote call.
Remember?
Not now.
To me
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
Nope.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow... for the Tooth Fairy?
You won't get nothing for his molar.
Come on, boys.
Let's help Big Abe find his goddamn molar.
No!
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Moon, let's you and me go buy Big Abe... a whole goddamn set of gold teeth!
You'll ruin everything acting like a goddamn fool.
I don't give a goddamn what anybody says!
I'm a gentleman!
And I'm not gonna throw up in this here house.
I'm going outside to throw up, 'cause I respect your house.
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house... any old time.
Goddamn gold!
Gold!
That son of a bitch is keeping gold from us!
God Almighty.
Son of a bitch.
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find Big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing?
You don't understand outlaws!
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and start singing your damn head off!
Hog liked my singing.
That's why they call him Hog!
Damn, Hermine.
Quit that goddamn coyote calling.
I'm here.
Your wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
She just had a little too much bug juice.
I figure you ain't had much of anything of anything... in a long time.
How's come you and the boys decided... to stop by tonight?
I want to make it real good for you, Henry.
Hermine, you ain't hearing what I'm asking.
- What was the question?
- I don't want to hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling and all... but I told you things has changed.
Crawl in, Henry.
See what I got.
Hermine, you ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell.
We had some times together that I'll never forget.
But Hermine, now I'm took.
Hold it.
That's enough.
Don't shoot.
Vamoose.
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why did you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you ain't gonna believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of Hermine.
That wasn't all you were trying to get off of her.
All I wanted to know was... if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about that damn gold than you do about me.
That ain't true.
I could have done what you think I done, but I didn't.
I don't believe you didn't.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman!
Well, you take her... but you forget all about the gold!
People can't afford business partners that cheat on 'em.
- We made an agreement.
- And I'm breaking it.
You can't do that to me.
I just did.
That tears it.
Gonna put the old double "X" to Henry Moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
You want your gun back, Moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
What gold?
That gold right there, goddamn it!
Real gold!
Where is it?
You ain't quite as ignorant as you look, are you?
- Come on in.
- How much we got here?
Enough.
As a matter of fact...
I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure, you was.
We're gonna hit the Longhorn Bank.
There ain't nothing in that goddamn chicken-feed bank... but sun-filled windows.
And all the little lady's gold.
- Let's hit her in the morning.
- Not yet.
Got a plan?
I'm gonna make that woman sorry... she ever said, "I do."
I tell you, he's hiding something from us.
- I don't think so.
- I know so.
I was certain he had a plan.
I knew he had a plan.
Me too, but I don't know if we're gonna be in on it or not!
Let's keep a watch on the son of a bitch.
Come on, gang!
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I got nothing to say.
I keep my word.
Honey!
Honey, are you all right?
Goddamn!
You all right?
- Yes.
- Watch it.
All right.
- Can you stand there?
- Yes.
Okay.
All right.
You all right?
Well, I've been better.
Easy.
Easy.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
Here, hold this.
You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take us a little Spanish pause.
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but if we're gonna die...
I want it to be as partners.
Fifty-fifty.
We was a good team.
Good?
Shit.
- We were the best.
- Honey pie--
Moon, I've been thinking.
Since we're gonna go anyway... why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Tie me up.
We're alive.
- I've been watching you, Henry.
- Figured.
Ain't you up a little early?
We don't hit the bank till 10:00.
Well, there's been a little change in plans.
Well, I gotta tell Big Abe.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
I'll never forget you, Hermine.
You was the first woman I didn't have to pay for.
You're a mite early, compadre.
I want to make a withdrawal.
Your better half's gonna have to do that.
Ordinance husbands aren't allowed to make withdrawals.
Besides, we're closed.
You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there in the bin.
Hurry up, Whitey.
I would've never figured you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, Whitey.
Grover, where is Julia at?
Goddamn.
Rocks.
Goddamn, honey pie.
Freeze, Moon!
Mr. Moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
I guess he ain't heard the news.
What news?
Your wife sold her property to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
When?
Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're on your way to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, Moon.
You're on your way to meet Señor Peter.
Come on out, Moon!
We know you got it!
I ain't got nothing!
We don't believe you!
Henry, who the hell is that?
The ex-Moon gang.
If they want a gunfight... they picked the wrong hombres to mess with!
Goddamn you!
Watch it, Big Abe!
Okay.
One, two, three!
- When did she leave?
- Why should I tell you?
About a half-hour ago.
Now!
Moon!
Shoot back.
Yes, sir, this is mighty strange stuff.
Miriam dropped a lantern in a puddle of it the other night... and the whole farm about near went up in flame!
Burned half the hair off of my head.
Stunk for two weeks.
Well, the railroad said they've got no use for it... so I thought perhaps I'd take these samples back east... and maybe sell it.
What do you think, Miss Julia?
I'm sorry, Mr. Standard.
I didn't hear what you said.
Whoa in there!
Hold up in there.
All right.
Just stay calm.
All right.
Step down, Julia.
Cotton, that son of a bitch can shoot.
He rode with Quantrill.
Come on.
You've run far enough.
Come on, now.
I'm losing my patience.
You ain't taking my gold!
They discovered gold!
They just had a little too much bug juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I supposed to write?
"Good luck, Henry and Hermine"?
Well, I was gonna explain everything.
- See, I--
- Mr. Moon.
Are you gonna rob this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle... or I'm gonna blow everybody in sight into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr. Moon.
It's all right, Sheriff.
You go on ahead.
He's just trying to impress me.
Are you sure, Julia?
Well... you two ought to try and get along, then.
We all had to.
My heart froze when I came home... and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up.
Thank you, Moon.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways... first, let's get used to being rich.
Oh, you, Rio Grande!
Get in there!
Come on, Speed!
This here's Mexican dirt!
You can't touch me!
You thought you'd get the old man in the moon.
You Texas clodbusters is a disgrace to the Confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down.
Get up!
Come on, Speed!
Goddamn it, Speed!
You can't do this!
This is Mexican territory!
I don't believe it!
He cross the Grande river and his horse faints on him!
I can't believe it!
It's a goddamn foreign country here!
This ain't fair, goddamn it!
This ain't fair!
This ain't fair!
Good Lord.
They're stringing up old Speed.
I have here a very fine animal... once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey!
I still own that horse!
When we want to hear from you, amigo... we'll rattle your cage.
Is that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted, but he got up, didn't he?
What?
What?
Towfield, I told you to keep these buzzards out of here!
Take it easy, Moon.
You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just wanted to take a gander at the man of the hour.
Yeah.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card, Moon.
I'm gonna miss ya.
Your family's here.
Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe.
Jimmy, Gussie and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy.
He thought you was really my family.
That's how I figured.
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
How ya doing, Henry?
Well... roll it out.
Nothing like that, Henry.
We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too good on your own, Henry, did you?
You should've stuck with us, 'cause we was going places, goddamn it.
What do you mean "was"?
All you gotta do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get ourselves--
Yeah, but that's without my plans.
Cut that out.
Big Abe, they're gonna send me to the bone orchard.
If you got anything you wanna give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your good-byes, boys.
Nice knowing you.
Yeah, Coogan, sure.
It just ain't right.
Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
- Law's gotta be changed.
- Yeah.
Go on outside.
So long, Moon.
Well, honey...
Least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had.
Except maybe that circus feller.
Why does that always upset you so?
What did you bring a thing like that up... at a time like this for, Hermine?
Shit!
Oh, Henry!
Oh, Abe!
Don't you worry none, Moon.
I'm gonna take care of this girl like she's my very own.
Come on, now.
Oh, Henry!
Mr. Moon?
It's about that time.
What about my last meal?
You're smoking it.
Hands behind your back, Mr. Moon.
He ain't for you, Serene.
I wouldn't take you to a dogfight... if you was the defending champ.
You oughtn't have done that, Mr. Moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
You tell him about the ordinance?
No.
Why not?
I don't like him... and people I don't like, I don't tell nothing.
Goddamn it, Towfield.
What ordinance?
What ordinance?
Sheriff Pile?
Kyle.
We got this ordinance here that was passed after the Civil War... account a lot of our boys didn't come home... and women was beginning to chew up the grass.
I feel sorry for the grass.
I feel sorry for the women.
Anyhow, this ordinance states that any man short of being a murderer... can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female... providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, too, as I recollect.
Sweet Jesus H. Christ almighty!
Ma'am?
I think there's a couple of things about me... that I'd like for you to consider.
I don't need your insults.
I agree with you completely... but you gotta take into consideration... that a man can get a little irritated... and he can act like the dickens... when he's about to pull hemp.
Buzzards, huh?
Well, buzzards can fly.
And they keep the desert clean!
I cook!
I cook like a son of a bitch!
I mean, like the dickens!
- Hello, son.
- Go to hell.
I understand.
Henry Lloyd Moon... you've been found guilty of horse thievery... and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this.
I wanna tell you good people of Longhorn... especially you lovely ladies... that the old saying...
"You can't judge a book by it's cover"-- it's true.
It's true.
Some books is all... scruffed up on the outside... but when you turn around and look inside... why, the words is just... wonderful.
Is that it, Moon?
Well, isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul."
That's not right.
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--"
I'm a veteran of the great Civil War!
"For thou art with me."
The only reason why I turned to crime... is there wasn't no jobs!
Not one single job for a man who risked his life... for this great country...
- "Thou anointest my head with oil." - and the Confederacy!
This one's dumb.
He'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
Bullshit!
He's ready to go!
Stop!
- I'll take him.
- Her again?
Florence.
Now--
Don't you think that you're... a mite too elderly to be taking on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran.
He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this sumbitchin' blindfold off me... and let me see my bride!
Where is she?
Florence!
Mrs. Henry Moon...
Let me look at you!
- Stand back, folks.
- Florence.
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
I think I made her dizzy.
Down she go.
Up you go!
Is she dead?
At least she died happy.
Then I'll take him.
Julia, what are you saying?
He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you were hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff Kyle, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink!
You want him?
According to the law, I can claim him, right?
I asked you out ten times.
What did I get?
A flap of your umbrella.
Shit!
All right.
Okay, Julia.
Mr. Moon... what do you say?
Well...
I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off... but what the hell.
Fine by me.
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't taking Frank Towfield's business tonight.
Somebody's taking it... or we ain't got no business.
Now, Mr. Moon, no drinking... no gambling, no wife-beating... no alley-catting, whatnot nor what have you.
You got to mind her... and if you try running, there will be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you.
Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
See?
I told you he had a plan.
You'll dance in the air, you son of a bitch-- stealing my girl.
Miss... in case you wanna know who you're dealing with...
I used to ride with Quantrill's Raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well, look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
Of course, a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find.
You were standing in front of the whole town... with a rope around your neck.
Yeah.
You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
I'm sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, Rover.
- That's Grover.
- Hey, Grover.
This is where I live.
Well, Julia, it ain't much... but it's a start.
Well, I guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
It looks like an opera house.
Please take your clothes off, Mr. Moon.
Take your clothes off, Mr. Moon.
Don't sit there.
Here.
Put these on.
These is--
These is work clothes.
That's right.
Well, I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine?
- In Texas?
- It's gonna be.
Looks like mice been into it.
First you'll begin crevicing.
Then crosscut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Then you insert the drill...
Like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blisters easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Mr. Moon--
Pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck... so let's not waste any more time.
I'll do all I can do... but that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How did you come in to this place?
It was my father's.
He believe in this gold mine?
He believed but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
How's about a little dessert?
Said...
"How's about a little dessert?"
I heard you the first time.
You didn't answer me the first time.
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time that you had a man?
I hope you don't mind working in confined spaces... because tomorrow we start tunneling.
Goddamn!
I should've knowed.
You can always tell a virgin on account of... the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
See, I got this theory on virgins... that they're always looking peaked and grouchy... on account of they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back... but in my time...
I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Listen to me.
Don't let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is--
I'll be outside in the barn... if you feel like getting acquainted or... talking about tunneling.
And remember.
Nature is the great provider.
Goddamn.
Good morning, Spot.
Get you some bacon?
Morning, Miss!
What's for breakfast?
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me.
I know how to pace myself.
If I want to...
I can do this all day long!
I'm talking about... all day long!
Pace myself.
Where are you going?
I want to... take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacing yourself.
You just go on trimming your wicks.
'Cause I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long!
All day long!
Hey, lady!
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
An awful lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the City of Motherly Love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
To Philadelphia?
Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
Pace suits me better.
Slow days and fast nights.
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw the lights and felt we wouldn't be intruding.
Oh, Lorette, you're never intruding.
Y'all remember my husband, Henry?
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought along a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
I'll get us some tea.
- Shall I help?
- We'll help.
Don't be long now.
We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to... especially now.
Look, honey, what Lorette's trying to say... is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Since you've never been married before... we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or Lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, Lorette.
You know, I rode with Quantrill.
Finest revolver gang in history till he died.
Quantrill died?
Last year.
That Shorty, he don't even ask.
He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night, he got all painted up like an Indian... and did he go on the warpath!
Mary!
Say, wanna have yourself a really wild time?
Why don't you dress up like an Indian?
Well, that sounds like it ought to be Julia's cup of tea.
I guess I'll go on out... and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is... it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
But if it should become one...
I have found... that the best thing to do... is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
How we doing, ladies?
- Bye.
- Bye.
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Let's do it again real soon!
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well... you know what they say:
"Lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog."
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know, I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air... why, it's poetry.
I think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon all over America... people's gonna be picking up chairs... and setting them down.
It's gonna be all your doing.
Julia... what do you say we try canning some of them apricots.
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox... and looking for two, hoping for the help of the Lord.
Why not get rid of all the oxen... and count on the Maker all the way?"
Very good.
I look forward to hearing it on Sunday.
Thank you.
Morning, ladies!
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night!
What in the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke?
No, you don't understand.
A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Miss Tate, please step into the office.
It's Mrs. Moon.
Excuse me.
- Miss Tate--
- Why, you--
Henry.
I believe this is between Mr. Polty and myself.
Hey, Moon!
It looks like the honeymoon is over!
What's the matter, Moon?
You're looking like a dog without a bone!
Hey, Hector.
Why don't you go down the Mexican side of town... see what the beans is jumping on.
"Beans"?
Beans.
You know, Polty's just another word for "chicken."
Good one, Towfield.
- Who thought it up for you?
- Come on!
Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
'Cause I'm in a good mood.
Well... then how's about a little snort?
Hey, Peachy.
Bottle of mash, two glasses, Norvell.
Not for him.
What do you mean, not for me?
Sheriff's orders.
Sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks.
You know...
I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for?
Hell!
If you hadn't jerked me back across the border... to my just desserts, so to speak... why, I'd never been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why... you sorta... introduced us.
Yeah, Towfield.
Things is good.
You heard about them matches made in heaven, didn't you?
Well, I met one of 'em!
Goddamn it, Moon!
You stole my girl!
Take it easy, Towfield.
You're a-wrinkling my good luck bandanna.
How's this?
You give me the bottle, and I'll--
I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
She puts chairs up on the wall... so's people can't set on 'em.
What?
I can't go into it, Towfield.
It's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Duck out back for a snort.
The trouble with Andrew Johnson is he's a damn mugwump.
Don't mention that son of a bitch's name to me.
Listen, amigo.
I don't ever want you to call me a bean again.
What the hell was that?
This is as difficult for me as it is for you, Julia.
Do you know, a year ago last Christmas Eve...
I had to move 150 Comanche souls... off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey?
You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
- What do you mean?
- This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it concerns me.
The railroad is taking over my land under eminent domain.
Chester, come on!
Eminent domain.
Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature... to take away some poor folks' land?
I won't dignify that with an answer.
I ain't asking for no dignification.
But I do finding it interesting that you... prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, Moon.
I'm sorry, Julia... but unless I am advised otherwise...
I'll be out to survey.
You know...
Polty's just another way of saying "chicken."
Whoa.
Whoa.
Oh, give me the girl
Who loves a man
And loves him for himself
Who's first consideration
Is not his strength and pelf
All sordid-minded damsels...
May worship golden dross
They may be old maids till they die
- And will never feel their loss
- Lovely.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Mother says I mustn't
Oh, George, please, George
- Not just yet
- Oh, yes.
Swim.
- Oh, Mother says I mustn't
- Swim.
Be naked.
- Mother says I mustn't
- Oh, yes.
Oh, George, please, George
Oh, I love you!
Who's there?
What are you doing?
Oh, Julia!
I was just out here surveying.
You liar!
You were spying on me!
Me?
I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia.
I swear on my honor.
- I didn't see a thing.
- Help!
It's not what you think!
- You old--
- What's going on here?
Nothing.
You bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying.
There's my equipment.
My tripod, my maps, et cetera.
- See?
- I caught you, didn't I?
I swear.
No.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then apologize.
- I apologize.
- All right.
Now eminent domain your ass out of here!
- Ooh, nasty!
- Weasel!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know.
Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
- That's all you like to do.
- No.
That ain't all I like to do.
Uh-uh, Moon.
Ooh!
Nasty!
Damn.
A norther.
- It's a norther.
- Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Outlaw don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
What am I doing?
I guess I was dreaming about the tunnel or something.
- Get down!
- "Get down"?
You got me drunk!
I don't remember a thing!
I didn't get you drunk!
I will not that kind of talk in my house!
- Hey!
- You tricked me!
I didn't trick you.
You get your clothes and get out!
There's work to do!
Oh.
I get it.
You're so afraid that you're gonna like that... that you're gonna forget about the gold and Philadelphia!
You get your clothes and you get out of here!
Son of a bitch!
I was right all these years!
Them painted ladies knows how to... appreciate a man.
There's no goddamn unnatural questions!
"How did it feel?"
Damn it!
I feel sorry... for the poor sumbitchin' son of a bitch that winds up with you!
Nice being married to you!
You haven't got a plug nickel!
- Come on!
- You haven't even got a gun!
You won't even get 20 miles before a posse will come and get you... and string you up!
The only reason why I slept with you is so you'd keep on working!
I hope they hang you!
Not the curtain!
You wouldn't dare!
Well...
I hadn't thought of it.
But now that you mention it... up in San Francisco...
I seen some Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilization.
They understand things about pleasure that...
I've never even thought of.
One thing for sure.
We ain't had a boring marriage.
Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
But 15 days?
- That's not fair.
- Tell it to the railroad.
We've been here since '43.
- Well, them's the breaks.
- Come on.
Damn black goo!
I was just going into town to... buy an anvil.
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Me and the little woman haven't been getting along of late.
Don't go in there!
Where's the doctor?
What's the matter, dear?
Where's the doctor?
Doctor.
Oh, yeah.
I never did get over there.
This pea-brain grabbed me and stuck me in an animal wagon.
It would have broke your heart to see it, honey.
You never told me about no doctor.
You never asked me about no doctor.
Is something wrong, Julia?
Female trouble.
Oh.
The vapors.
I better put you to bed, darling.
I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell did you pick him up for, Towfield?
- He was dressed up like a Mexican.
- You can't arrest a man for that.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
I told him.
I told you, but, no, you wouldn't--
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not.
Yeah.
I can see it.
Them eyes ain't angry.
They're relieved... and they ain't bloodshot no more.
I wanted you back for one reason-- to work the mine.
You missed the old man in the moon.
Hell, I got my faults, I admit it, but... well, hell, I got my ways too.
Yeah, I--
I missed you a little bit too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border...
I couldn't stop but thinking that... nobody's ever saved my life before.
And I just couldn't leave you in your time of need of me.
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out.
I think I'll take a siesta.
You don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
Bats.
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up too.
Didn't I want to ride with the Younger gang... and they wouldn't have me?
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a Younger.
My feelings was hurt... but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw, you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good Lord Almighty, I've found gold!
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I been here.
I know it's around here somewhere.
- I can feel it!
- I don't see nothing.
- It's here.
- Where?
- Believe me, it's here.
- Where?
Goddamn!
Look at that!
Gold!
Goddamn, it's all over everything.
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, honey, kiss me.
I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich.
I knew it.
You wait long enough, and pretty soon... down it's going to come right on you.
Looks like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know, I'm gonna get my initials put on my saddle... in gold.
They like it that way down there in Mexico.
Alls we gotta do now is... deposit this first bunch in the bank and then--
"We"?
What do you mean, "we"?
What are you saying?
Well, just that in all fairness, I played a part... in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd have never struck it if it wasn't for me.
Correcto?
So?
So, where's my--
Where's my share of the stake?
You're right.
I'll give you ten percent.
You don't understand.
You see... sharing is giving to each other.
Fifty percent.
We'll talk about it later.
All right, all right.
Twenty-five percent, and we can... stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny actually depositing something in a bank, huh, Moon?
Yeah.
It's a whole new experience for me.
That's it.
Sure are sorry to have you and Miriam leaving us.
Thank you, Mrs. Haber, but with the railroad... and this black stuff springing up everywheres... a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
Well, I'll guard it with my life.
You can do better than that, Whitey.
Henry Lloyd Moon at the bank.
Want one of these?
Sure.
Goddamn it.
I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the Younger gang.
Doll...
I think I'll buy me a little cantina... south of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey, I'm gonna be a patron.
Tequila, cards... senoritas.
Wait till the Domingi sisters get a load of me!
Don't do that.
You're acting foolish.
Maybe you ought to try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
Fifty percent?
You're going to give me... fifty percent?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're going to put it that way... yeah.
I don't know how to... say this, Henry... but...
I think I got... greedy and selfish...
Living alone so long.
Well... that's how you get.
Once you get started... you don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
- Friends of yours?
- Used to be.
- What are they doing here?
- Good question.
Well!
Sorry to keep you all waiting, but... me and the missus was just playing a little game of fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree, Moon.
Oh, did you?
Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was... gonna have you all out.
Well, you damn sure got your wish, didn't you?
I damn sure did.
Ain't you gonna ask us in, Henry?
Why, sure, honey pie.
Don't you boys know how to wipe your feet?
Hey, Hog Coogan!
Wipe your feet off.
Hope you like taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me Big Abe.
Old Henry still snore in his sleep?
I want them out of here!
Not as much as I do.
You want them to find out about the dust?
Well!
- Anybody hungry?
- Hungry?
Shit.
I could eat a frozen dog.
We'll go on out to the kitchen and see if we got one already froze.
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
- A feast fit for a king.
- That's his speciality.
Them female bull feathers make it tasty.
Did you know that old Henry used to cook for the Raiders?
He cooked for Quantrill's Raiders?
No, he never told me that.
I bet there's a lot of things he never told you.
Shit, Hog!
Goddamn, Abe.
- Jesus Christ!
- You loosened my molar up!
Grab your girl Now pull on her mane
Just play along a little while longer.
Well, you go on ahead.
I don't want to spoil your fun.
I ain't having a good time.
I swear I ain't.
I'm just trying to throw them off the track.
They wouldn't know it was me if I wasn't acting wild and--
Forget about all this and get in there and have a good time.
Act foolish!
Beautiful dreamer
Awaken to me
Beautiful dreamer
Waken to me
Starlight and dewdrops are waitin' for thee
Ah, shit.
This ain't no real marriage.
Come on.
Meet me tonight, huh?
I'll give you my old coyote call.
Remember?
Not now.
To me
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
Nope.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow... for the Tooth Fairy?
You won't get nothing for his molar.
Come on, boys.
Let's help Big Abe find his goddamn molar.
No!
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Moon, let's you and me go buy Big Abe... a whole goddamn set of gold teeth!
You'll ruin everything acting like a goddamn fool.
I don't give a goddamn what anybody says!
I'm a gentleman!
And I'm not gonna throw up in this here house.
I'm going outside to throw up, 'cause I respect your house.
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house... any old time.
Goddamn gold!
Gold!
That son of a bitch is keeping gold from us!
God Almighty.
Son of a bitch.
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find Big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing?
You don't understand outlaws!
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and start singing your damn head off!
Hog liked my singing.
That's why they call him Hog!
Damn, Hermine.
Quit that goddamn coyote calling.
I'm here.
Your wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
She just had a little too much bug juice.
I figure you ain't had much of anything of anything... in a long time.
How's come you and the boys decided... to stop by tonight?
I want to make it real good for you, Henry.
Hermine, you ain't hearing what I'm asking.
- What was the question?
- I don't want to hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling and all... but I told you things has changed.
Crawl in, Henry.
See what I got.
Hermine, you ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell.
We had some times together that I'll never forget.
But Hermine, now I'm took.
Hold it.
That's enough.
Don't shoot.
Vamoose.
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why did you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you ain't gonna believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of Hermine.
That wasn't all you were trying to get off of her.
All I wanted to know was... if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about that damn gold than you do about me.
That ain't true.
I could have done what you think I done, but I didn't.
I don't believe you didn't.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman!
Well, you take her... but you forget all about the gold!
People can't afford business partners that cheat on 'em.
- We made an agreement.
- And I'm breaking it.
You can't do that to me.
I just did.
That tears it.
Gonna put the old double "X" to Henry Moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
You want your gun back, Moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
What gold?
That gold right there, goddamn it!
Real gold!
Where is it?
You ain't quite as ignorant as you look, are you?
- Come on in.
- How much we got here?
Enough.
As a matter of fact...
I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure, you was.
We're gonna hit the Longhorn Bank.
There ain't nothing in that goddamn chicken-feed bank... but sun-filled windows.
And all the little lady's gold.
- Let's hit her in the morning.
- Not yet.
Got a plan?
I'm gonna make that woman sorry... she ever said, "I do."
I tell you, he's hiding something from us.
- I don't think so.
- I know so.
I was certain he had a plan.
I knew he had a plan.
Me too, but I don't know if we're gonna be in on it or not!
Let's keep a watch on the son of a bitch.
Come on, gang!
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I got nothing to say.
I keep my word.
Honey!
Honey, are you all right?
Goddamn!
You all right?
- Yes.
- Watch it.
All right.
- Can you stand there?
- Yes.
Okay.
All right.
You all right?
Well, I've been better.
Easy.
Easy.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
Here, hold this.
You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take us a little Spanish pause.
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but if we're gonna die...
I want it to be as partners.
Fifty-fifty.
We was a good team.
Good?
Shit.
- We were the best.
- Honey pie--
Moon, I've been thinking.
Since we're gonna go anyway... why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Tie me up.
We're alive.
- I've been watching you, Henry.
- Figured.
Ain't you up a little early?
We don't hit the bank till 10:00.
Well, there's been a little change in plans.
Well, I gotta tell Big Abe.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
I'll never forget you, Hermine.
You was the first woman I didn't have to pay for.
You're a mite early, compadre.
I want to make a withdrawal.
Your better half's gonna have to do that.
Ordinance husbands aren't allowed to make withdrawals.
Besides, we're closed.
You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there in the bin.
Hurry up, Whitey.
I would've never figured you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, Whitey.
Grover, where is Julia at?
Goddamn.
Rocks.
Goddamn, honey pie.
Freeze, Moon!
Mr. Moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
I guess he ain't heard the news.
What news?
Your wife sold her property to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
When?
Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're on your way to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, Moon.
You're on your way to meet Señor Peter.
Come on out, Moon!
We know you got it!
I ain't got nothing!
We don't believe you!
Henry, who the hell is that?
The ex-Moon gang.
If they want a gunfight... they picked the wrong hombres to mess with!
Goddamn you!
Watch it, Big Abe!
Okay.
One, two, three!
- When did she leave?
- Why should I tell you?
About a half-hour ago.
Now!
Moon!
Shoot back.
Yes, sir, this is mighty strange stuff.
Miriam dropped a lantern in a puddle of it the other night... and the whole farm about near went up in flame!
Burned half the hair off of my head.
Stunk for two weeks.
Well, the railroad said they've got no use for it... so I thought perhaps I'd take these samples back east... and maybe sell it.
What do you think, Miss Julia?
I'm sorry, Mr. Standard.
I didn't hear what you said.
Whoa in there!
Hold up in there.
All right.
Just stay calm.
All right.
Step down, Julia.
Cotton, that son of a bitch can shoot.
He rode with Quantrill.
Come on.
You've run far enough.
Come on, now.
I'm losing my patience.
You ain't taking my gold!
They discovered gold!
They just had a little too much bug juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I supposed to write?
"Good luck, Henry and Hermine"?
Well, I was gonna explain everything.
- See, I--
- Mr. Moon.
Are you gonna rob this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle... or I'm gonna blow everybody in sight into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr. Moon.
It's all right, Sheriff.
You go on ahead.
He's just trying to impress me.
Are you sure, Julia?
Well... you two ought to try and get along, then.
We all had to.
My heart froze when I came home... and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up.
Thank you, Moon.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways... first, let's get used to being rich.
Oh!
Oh, you, Rio Grande!
Get in there!
Come on, speed!
¡Viva Mexico!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
Oh!
Yah!
Hah!
Ee-ha ha ha!
¡Viva Mexico!
This here's Mexican dirt!
You can't touch me!
Ha ha!
Hee hee hee!
Oh!
Ooh hoo hoo!
You thought you'd get the old man in the moon.
You Texas clown buzzards is a disgrace to the confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down.
Get up!
Come on, speed!
Goddamn it, speed!
You can't do this!
This is Mexican territory!
I don't believe it!
He got across the river, and his horse faints on him!
I can't believe it!
It's a goddamn foreign country here!
This ain't fair, goddamn it!
This ain't fair!
This ain't fair!
They're stringing up old speed.
I have here a very fine animal once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey!
I still own that horse.
When we want to hear from you, amigo, we'll rattle your cage.
Ha ha ha!
Is that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted, but he got up, didn't he?
Ha ha ha!
What?
What?
Oh!
Towfield, I told you to keep these buzzards out of here!
Take it easy, moon.
You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just wanted to take a gander at the man of the hour.
Yeah.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card, moon.
I'm going to miss you.
Your family's here.
Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe,
Jimmy, gussie, and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy.
He thought you was really my family.
That's how I figured.
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
How you doing, Henry?
Well...
Roll it out.
Nothing like that, Henry.
We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too goddamn good on your own, Henry, did you?
Now, you should have stuck with us because we was going places, goddamn it!
What do you mean "was"?
All you got to do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get ourselves... yeah, but that's without my plans.
Ah, cut that out.
Big Abe, they're going to send me to the bone orchard.
If you got anything you want to give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your good-byes, boys.
Nice knowing you.
Yeah, coogan, sure.
You know, it just ain't right.
Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
The law's got to be changed, Henry.
Come on now, Clyde.
So long, moon.
Adios.
Oh...
Well, honey, least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had...
Except for maybe that circus feller.
Why does that always upset you so?
What the hell did you bring a thing like that up at a time like this for, hermine?
Shit!
Henry!
Henry!
Don't you worry none, moon.
I'll take care of this girl like she's my very own.
Come on, now.
Oh, Henry!
Henry!
Mr. Moon?
It's about that time.
What about my last meal?
You're smoking it.
Ha ha ha!
Hands behind your back, Mr. Moon.
He ain't for you, serene.
I wouldn't take you to a dogfight if you was the defending champ.
You oughtn't have done that,
Mr. Moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
You tell him about the ordinance?
No.
Why not?
I don't like him, and people I don't like
I don't tell nothing.
Goddamn it, towfield.
What ordinance?
What ordinance?
Sheriff pile?
Kyle.
We got this ordinance here.
It was passed after the civil war on account of a lot of our boys didn't come home, and the women was beginning to chew up the grass.
I feel sorry for the grass.
I'm feeling sorry for the women.
Anyhow, this ordinance states that any man short of being a murderer can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female, providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, too, as I recollect.
Sweet Jesus h.
Christ almighty!
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
I think there's a couple of things about me that I'd like for you to consider.
I don't need your insults.
Oh, I agree with you completely, but you got to take into consideration a man can get a little irritated, and he can act like the dickens when he's about to pull hemp.
Buzzards, huh?
Well, buzzards can fly, and they keep the desert clean.
I cook!
I cook like the son-of-a-bitch!
I mean, like the dickens!
Oh!
Hello, son.
Go to hell.
I understand.
Be quiet!
Shh!
Henry Lloyd moon, you've been found guilty of horse thievery and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this.
I want to tell you good people of longhorn...
Especially you lovely ladies, that the old saying...
"you can't judge a book by its cover"... it's true.
It's true.
Some books is all scruffed up on the outside, but when you turn around and look inside, why, the words is...
Just...
Wonderful.
Is that it, moon?
Well, isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The lord is my Shepherd.
"I shall not want.
Aw...
"He maketh me to lie down
"in green pastures.
"He leadeth me
"beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul."
That's not right.
"The lord is my Shepherd.
"I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down.
"In green pastures.
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me
"beside the still waters.
Yea, though I walk through the valley..."
oh!
I'm a veteran of the great civil war!
The only reason why I turned to crime is there wasn't no jobs... not one single job for a man that risked his life for the country...
"Thou anointest my head..."
and the confederacy!
This one's dumb.
He'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the lord forever."
Bullshit!
He's ready to go!
Stop!
I'll take him.
Florence.
Now... ah!
Don't you think that you're a mite too elderly to be taking on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran.
He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this son-bitching blindfold off me and let me see my bride!
Where is she?
Florence!
Aah!
Florence!
Ah ha ha!
Ah!
Mrs. Henry moon, let me look at you.
Stand back, folks.
Florence.
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
I think I made her dizzy.
Down she go, up you go!
Is she dead?
At least she died happy.
Then I'll take him.
Julia, what are you saying?
He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you were hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff Kyle, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink!
You want him?
According to the law I can claim him, right?
I asked you out 10 times.
What do I get?
A flap of your umbrella.
Shit!
All right.
Ok, Julia.
Mr. Moon, what do you say?
Well, I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off, but...
What the hell.
Fine by me.
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't taking' Frank tokin's business tonight.
Somebody's taking his business, or we ain't got no business.
¶
¶
Wonderful!
Aha!
Now, Mr. Moon, no drinking.
No gambling.
No wife-beating.
No alley-catting, whatnot, and what have you.
You've got to mind her.
If you try running, there will be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you.
Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
Adios!
¡Bienvenidos!
See?
I told you he had a plan.
You'll dance in the air, you son-of-a-bitch...
For stealing' my girl!
Miss, ah...
In case you want to know who you're dealing with...
I used to ride with quantrell's raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
'Course a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find.
You were standin' in front of the whole town with a rope around your neck.
Yeah.
You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
I'm sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, rover.
That's grover.
Grover.
This is where I live.
Well, Julia, it ain't much, but it's a start.
Well, I guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
Well then, it, uh...
Looks like an opera house.
Please take your clothes off,
Mr. Moon.
Don't sit there.
Here.
Put these on.
These is, uh...
These are work clothes.
That's right.
Well, I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine?
In Texas?
It's going to be.
Looks like mice been into it.
First you'll begin crevassing, then crosscut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't, uh, familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Huh?
Then you insert the drill like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Simple.
Yeah.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blisters easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Uh...
Mr. Moon... pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck, so let's not waste any more time.
Well,
I'll do all I can do, but that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How did you come into this place?
It was my father's.
Did he believe in this gold mine?
He believed, but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
How's about a little dessert?
Said, uh...
How's about a little dessert?
I heard you the first time.
You didn't answer me the first time.
Um...
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time that you had a man?
I hope you don't mind working in confined spaces because tomorrow we start tunneling.
Goddamn!
I should have known.
You can always tell a virgin on account of the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
Ha ha ha!
See, I got this theory on virgins... that they always look peaked and grouchy on account of they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back, but in my time, I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Oh, listen.
Don't, uh, let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is, uh...
Hee hee ha hee!
I'll be outside in the barn if you feel like getting acquainted, or, uh, talking about tunneling.
And remember, nature is the great provider.
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh, goddamn.
Well, good morning, spot.
Get you some bacon?
Good morning, miss!
What's for breakfast?
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me.
I know how to pace myself.
If I want to...
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about...
Allday long.
Where are you supposed to set?
Where are you going?
Well...
I want to...
Take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacing' yourself.
You just go on trimming' your wicks.
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long!
All day long!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, lady!
No cabeza, no trabajo.
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
An awful lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the city of motherly love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
To Philadelphia?
Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
The pace suits me better... slow days and fast nights.
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw the lights and felt we wouldn't be intruding.
Oh, lorette, you're never intruding.
Uh, y'all remember my husband Henry.
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought along a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
I'll get us some tea.
Shall I help?
We'll help.
Don't be long, now.
We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to, especially now.
Look, honey, what lorette's trying to say is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Oh.
Since you've never been married before, we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, lorette.
Ha ha ha!
You know, I rode with quantrell... finest revolver gang in history till he died.
Quantrell died?
Last year.
Mmm.
That shorty...
He don't even ask.
He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take no for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night, he got all painted up like an Indian, and did he go on the warpath!
Woo woo woo!
Say, want to have yourself a really wild time?
Why don't you dress up like an Indian?
Ha!
Well, that sounds like it ought to be Julia's cup of tea.
Ha ha ha!
I guess I'll, uh, go on out and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
Uh-huh.
But if it should become one,
I have found that the best thing to do is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
How we doin', ladies?
Bye!
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Let's do it again real soon.
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well...
You know what they say... lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog.
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know,
I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air.
Why, it's poetry.
I think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon... all over America, people's going to be picking up chairs and setting them down.
It's going to be all your doing.
Julia...
What do you say we try canning some of them apricots?
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox
"and looking for two,
"hoping for the help of the lord.
"Why not get rid of all the oxen and count on the maker all the way?"
Very good.
I look forward to hearing it on Sunday.
Thank you.
Morning, ladies.
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night.
Yah!
Julia!
What in the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke.
No.
You don't understand.
A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Miss Tate, please step into the office.
It's, uh, Mrs. Moon.
Excuse me.
Miss Tate... why, you...
Henry.
I believe this is between Mr. Polty and myself.
Hey, moon!
It looks like the honeymoon is over!
Ha ha ha!
What's the matter, moon?
You're looking like a dog without a bone.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Hector.
Yeah?
Why don't you go down to the Mexican side of town and see what the beans is jumping on.
Beans?
Beans.
You know...
Polty's just another word for chicken.
Good one, towfield.
Who thought it up for you?
Come on!
Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
Because I'm in a good mood.
Well...
Then, uh, how's about a little snort?
¶
Hey, peachy.
Bottle of mash and two glasses, norvell.
Not for him.
What do you mean, not for me?
Sheriff's orders.
The sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks.
Ah!
You know, I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for?
Hell!
If you hadn't jerked me back across the border to my just deserts, so to speak, why, I'd never have been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why...
You sort of...
Introduced us.
Yeah, towfield...
Things is good.
You heard about them matches made in heaven, didn't you?
Well, I'm in one of them.
Goddamn it, moon!
You stole my girl!
Take it easy, towfield.
You're wrinkling my good-luck bandanna.
How's this... you give me the bottle, and I'll, uh, I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
She puts chairs up on the wall so's people can't sit on them.
What?
I can't go into it, towfield.
It's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Duck out back for a snort.
The trouble with Andrew Johnson is he's a damn mugwump.
Oh, don't mention that son-of-a-bitch's name.
Ugh!
Listen, amigo.
I don't ever want you to call me a bean again.
What the hell was that?
This is as difficult for me as it is for you, Julia.
Ha!
You know, a year ago last Christmas Eve,
I had to move 150 comanche souls off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey?
You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
What do you mean?
This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it concerns me.
The railroad's taking over my land under eminent domain.
Chester, come on!
Eminent domain.
Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature to take away some poor folks' land?
I won't dignify that with an answer.
I ain't askin' for no dignification.
But I do find it interesting that you, uh, prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, moon.
I'm sorry, Julia, but unless I am advised otherwise,
I'll be out to survey.
You know...
Polty's just another way of saying chicken.

I love you!
Who's there?
What are you doing?
Oh, Julia!
I was just out here surveying.
You liar!
You were spying on me!
Me?
I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia, I swear on my honor
I didn't see a thing!
It's not what you think!
You old... what's going on here?
Nothing.
You bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying.
There's my equipment... my tripod, my maps, et cetera.
I caught you, didn't I?
I swear, no.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then apologize.
I apologize.
All right.
Now eminent domain your ass out of here.
Ha ha ha!
Woo, nasty.
Ooh!
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know.
Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
That's all you like to do.
No, that ain't all I like to do.
Uh-uh, moon.
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Ha ha ha!
Ooh!
Nasty!
Damn.
A norther.
It's a norther.
Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Julia...
An outlaw doesn't know how to take no for an answer.
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
Huh?
What am I doing?
Oh, I guess I was dreaming about a tunnel or something.
Get up!
You got me drunk.
I don't remember a thing!
I didn't get you drunk!
Aah!
I will not have that kind of talk in my house!
Hey!
You tricked me!
I didn't trick you.
You get your clothes and get out!
There's work to do!
Oh.
I get it.
You're so afraid that you're going to like that...
That you're going to forget about the gold and Philadelphia!
You get your clothes, and you get out of here!
Son-of-a-bitch!
I was right all these years!
There ain't a lady that knows how to appreciate a man.
No goddamn...
Unnatural questions!
"How did it feel?"
Damn it!
I feel sorry for the poor son-of-a-bitch that, son-of-a-bitch that winds up with you!
Nice being married to you!
Ugh!
Uh!
Oh!
You haven't got a plugged nickel!
You haven't even got a gun!
Yeah!
Uh!
You won't get 20 Miles before a posse will come and get you and string you up!
The only reason why I slept with you was so you'd keep on working!
I hope they hang you!
You...
Oh!
Not the curtain!
You wouldn't dare!
Well...
I hadn't thought of it, but now that you mention it, up in San Francisco,
I seen some Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilization.
They understand things about pleasure that,
I've never even thought of.
One thing for sure...
We ain't had a boring marriage.
¶
Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
But 15 days?
That's not fair.
Tell it to the railroad.
We've been here since '43.
Well, them's the breaks.
Come on!
Damn black goo!
Giddy-up!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Giddy-up!
Huh!
Well...
I was just going into town to...
Buy an anvil.
Julia?
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Uh, me and the little woman haven't been getting along of late.
Don't go in there!
Oh!
Julia?
Julia?
Where's the doctor?
What's the matter, dear?
Where's the doctor?
Doctor...
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I never did get over there.
This pea brain grabbed me and stuck me in an animal wagon.
It would have broke your heart to see it, honey.
You never told me about no doctor.
You never asked me about no doctor.
Is something wrong, Julia?
Female trouble.
Oh...
The vapors.
I better put you to bed, darling.
I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell did you pick him up for, towfield?
He was dressed up like a Mexican.
You can't arrest a man for that.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
Julia.
I told him.
I told you, but, no, you would...
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not.
Yeah.
I can see it.
Them eyes ain't angry.
They're relieved, and they ain't bloodshot no more.
I wanted you back for one reason... to work the mine.
Naw.
You missed the old man in the moon.
Ha ha ha!
Hell, I got my faults.
I admit it, but...
Aw, hell, I got my ways, too.
Yeah, I...
I missed you a little bit, too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border,
I couldn't stop but thinking nobody's ever saved my life before.
And I just couldn't leave you in your time of need of me.
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out.
I think I'll take a poca siesta.
Oh, you don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
Bats.
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up, too.
Didn't I want to ride with the younger gang, and they wouldn't have me?
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a younger.
My feelings was hurt, but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw, you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good lord almighty, I've found gold!
Gold!
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I been here.
I know it's around here somewheres.
I can feel it!
I don't see nothing.
It's here.
Believe me.
It's here.
Where?
Goddamn!
Ha ha ha!
Gold.
Look at that!
Gold!
Oh!
Gold!
Goddamn, it's all over everything.
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, honey, kiss me.
I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich.
I knew it.
You wait long enough, and pretty soon, down it's going to come right on you.
Like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know,
I'm going to get my initials put on my saddle, in gold.
They like it that way in Mexico.
Alls we got to do now is...
Deposit this first bunch in the bank and then...
"we"?
What do you mean, "we"?
What are you saying?
Well, just that, in all fairness,
I played a part in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd have never struck it if it wasn't for me.
Correcto?
So?
So...
Ha ha!
Where's my... where's my share in the stake?
Ha ha!
You're right.
I'll give you 10%.
Ha ha ha!
You don't understand.
You see, sharing is giving to each other.
50%.
We'll talk about it later.
Oh, all right, all right, all right.
Uh, 25%, and we can...
Stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny actually depositing something in a bank, huh, moon?
Yeah!
It's a whole new experience for me.
That's it.
Sure are sorry to have you and Miriam leaving us.
Thank you, Mrs. Haber, but with the railroad and this black stuff springing up everywheres, a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Ohhh!
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
Well, I'll guard it with my life.
Aw, you can do better than that, whitey.
Henry Lloyd moon at the bank.
Hmm.
Want one of these?
Sure.
Goddamn it.
I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the younger gang.
Doll,
I think I'll buy me a little cantina.
South of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey, I'm going to be a patron.
Tequila...
Cards...
Senoritas...
Hey.
Wait till the domingi sisters get a load of me!
Ha ha ha!
"Buenas noches, señor moon.
Como esta usted, señor moon?"
"Muy bien, gracias.
Y usted?"
Ha ha ha!
Woo!
Don't do that.
You're acting foolish.
Maybe you ought to try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
50%?
You're going to give me... 50%?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're going to put it that way.
Yeah.
I don't know how to...
Say this, Henry...
But...
I think I got...
Greedy and selfish living alone so long.
Well...
That's how you get.
Once you get started...
You don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
¶
¡Dios mio!
Friends of yours?
Used to be.
What are they doing here?
Good question.
Well, ha ha!
Sorry to keep you all waiting, but, uh...
Me and the missis was just playing a little game of fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree, moon.
Oh, did you?
Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was, uh, going to have you all out.
Well, you damn sure got your wish, didn't you?
Ha ha ha!
I damn sure did.
Ain't you going to ask us in, Henry?
Why, sure, honey pie.
Mi casa es su casa.
Don't you boys know how to wipe your feet?
Hey, hog coogan!
Wipe your feet off.
Hope you like Taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me big Abe.
Old Henry still snore in his sleep?
¶
I want them out of here!
Not as much as I do.
Moon!
You want them to find out about the dust?
Ha ha ha ha!
Well!
Anybody hungry?
Hungry?
Shit, I could eat a frozen dog.
Ha ha ha!
Well, we'll go on out to the kitchen, and see if we got one already froze.
Ha ha ha!
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
Ha ha ha!
¶
¡Estufado del diablo!
A feast fit for a king.
That's his speciality.
Them female bullfeathers make it tasty.
Did you know that old Henry used to cook for the raiders?
He cooked for quantrell's raiders?
No.
He never told me that.
I bet there's a lot of things he never told you.
Shit!
Abe!
Goddamn, Abe.
Jesus Christ!
You'll loosen my molar up!
¶
¶ Grab your girl, now pull on her mane ¶
yahoo!
Just play along a little while longer.
Well, you go on ahead.
I don't want to spoil your fun.
Well, I ain't having a good time.
I swear I ain't.
I'm just trying to throw them off the track.
They wouldn't know it was me if I wasn't acting wild and...
Aw...
Forget about all this.
Get in there and have a good time.
Act foolish!
Woo!
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶
¶ awaken to me ¶
¶ beautiful dreamer ¶
¶ waken to me ¶
¶ starlight and dewdrops are waitin' for thee ¶
¶ thee ¶ ah, shit.
¶
This ain't no real marriage.
Come on.
Meet me tonight, huh?
I'll give you my old coyote call.
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶ remember?
A-woo... not now.
¶ To me ¶
woo hoo!
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
Nope.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow for the tooth fairy?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Tooth fairy!
You won't get nothing for his molar.
Well, come on, boys.
Let's help big Abe find his goddamn molar.
No!
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Moon, let's you and me go buy big Abe a whole damn set of gold teeth!
Ha ha!
You'll ruin everything acting like a goddamn fool.
I don't give a damn what anybody says!
I'm a gentleman!
And I'm not going to throw up in this here house.
I'm going outside to throw up 'cause I...
I respect your house.
Um...
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house any old time.
Ha ha ha!
Goddamn gold!
Gold!
That son-of-a-bitch is keeping gold from us.
God almighty.
Son-of-a-bitch.
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing?
You don't understand outlaws!
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and start singing your damn fool head off!
Hog liked my singing.
That's why they call him hog!
A-woo!
A-woo!
Aah!
Damn, hermine.
Quit your goddamn coyote calling.
I'm here.
Your wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
She just had a little too much bug-juice.
Ha ha ha!
I figure you ain't had much of anything of anything in a long time.
How's come you and the boys decided to stop by tonight?
I want to make it good for you, Henry.
Honey, you ain't hearing what I'm asking.
What was the question?
I don't want to hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling, but I told you things has changed.
Crawl in, Henry.
See what I got.
Hermine, you ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell.
We had some times together that I'll never forget.
But, hermine, now I'm took.
Henry.
Aah!
Hold it.
That's enough.
Uh...
Don't shoot.
Vamoose.
Well...
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why did you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you ain't going to believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of hermine.
That wasn't all you were trying to get off of her.
All I wanted to know was if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about that damn gold than about me.
That ain't true.
I could have done what you think, but I didn't.
I don't believe you didn't.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman!
You take her, but you forget all about the gold.
People can't afford business partners that cheat on them.
We made an agreement.
And I'm breaking it.
You can't do that to me.
I just did.
That tears it.
Going to put the old double "x" to Henry moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
You want your gun back, moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
What gold?
That gold there.
That's real gold!
Where is it?
You ain't as ignorant as you look, are you?
Come on in.
How much we got here?
Enough.
In fact, I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure, you was.
We're going to hit the longhorn bank.
There ain't nothing in that chicken-feed bank but sun-filled windows.
And all the little lady's gold.
Let's hit her in the morning.
Not yet.
Got a plan?
I'm going to make that woman sorry she ever said, "I do."
I tell you, he's hiding something from us.
I don't think so.
I know so.
I was certain he had a plan.
Me, too, but I don't know if we're going to be in it.
Let's keep a watch on the son-of-a-bitch.
Come on, gang!
You...
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I've got nothing to say.
I keep my word.
Julia!
Honey!
Moon!
Honey, are you all right?
Goddamn!
You all right?
Yes.
Oh!
All right.
Can you stand there?
Yes.
O.K. All right.
You all right?
Well, I've been better.
Easy.
Easy.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Here, hold this.
You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take us a little Spanish pause.
Henry Lloyd?
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but if we're going to die,
I...
I want it to be as partners.
50/50.
We was a good team.
Good?
Shit.
We were the best.
Honey pie...
Moon, I've been thinking.
Since we're going to go anyway, why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Moon, tie me up.
Julia...
We're alive.
I've been watching you, Henry.
Figured.
Ain't you up early?
We don't hit the bank till 10:00.
Well, there's been a little change in plans.
Well, I got to tell big Abe.
You got to do what you got to do.
I'll never forget you, hermine.
You was the first woman
I didn't have to pay for.
Adios.
You're a mite early, compadre.
I want to make a withdrawal.
Your better half has to do that.
Ordinance husbands aren't allowed to make withdrawals.
Besides, we're closed.
You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there in the bin.
Hurry up, whitey.
I never figured you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, whitey.
Hyah!
Julia!
Julia?
Grover, where is Julia at?
Julia!
Goddamn.
Rocks.
Goddamn, honey pie.
Freeze, moon!
Mr. Moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
I guess he ain't heard the news.
Ha ha ha!
What news?
Your wife sold her property to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
When?
Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're on your way to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, moon.
You're on your way to meet senor Peter.
Come out, moon.
We know you got it!
I ain't got nothing!
We don't believe you!
Henry, who the hell is that?
The ex-moon gang.
¡Chinga LA luna!
If they want a gunfight, they picked the wrong hombresto mess with!
Goddamn you!
Watch it, big Abe!
Ok. 1, 2, 3!
When did she leave?
Why should I tell you?
About a half-hour ago.
Now!
Moon.
Shoot back.
Yes, sir, this is mighty strange stuff.
Muriel dropped a lantern in a puddle of it the other night, and the whole farm 'bout near went up in flame!
Burned half the hair off of my head.
Stunk for two weeks.
The railroad said they've got no use for it, so I thought I'd take samples back east and maybe sell it.
What do you think, miss Julia?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Standard.
I didn't hear what you said.
Hyah!
Aah!
Whoa in there!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Hold up in there.
All right.
Stay calm.
Whoa.
Whoa.
All right.
Step down, Julia.
Whoa.
Cotton, that son-of- a-bitch can shoot.
He rode with quantrell.
Come on, you've run far enough.
Come on, now.
I'm losing my patience.
You ain't taking my gold!
They discovered gold!
Nah.
They had a little too much bug-juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I supposed to write?
"Good luck, Henry and hermine"?
I was going to explain everything.
See, I...
Mr. Moon.
Are you robbing this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle, or I'll blow everybody into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr. Moon.
It's all right, sheriff.
You go on ahead.
He's just trying to impress me.
Are you sure, Julia?
Oh.
Well...
You two ought to try and get along, then.
We all had to.
Hyah!
My heart froze when I came home and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up.
Oh!
Thank you, moon.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure, you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways...
First, let's get used to being rich.
Oh!
Oh, you, Rio Grande!
Get in there!
Come on, speed!
Viva Mexico!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
Oh!
Yah!
Hah!
Ee-ha ha ha!
Viva Mexico!
This here's Mexican dirt!
You can't touch me!
Ha ha!
Hee hee hee!
Oh!
Ooh hoo hoo!
You thought you'd get the old man in the moon.
You Texas clown buzzards is a disgrace to the confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down.
Get up!
Come on, speed!
Goddamn it, speed!
You can't do this!
This is Mexican territory!
I don't believe it!
He got across the river, and his horse faints on him!
I can't believe it!
It's a goddamn foreign country here!
This ain't fair, goddamn it!
This ain't fair!
This ain't fair!
They're stringing up old speed.
I have here a very fine animal once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey!
I still own that horse.
When we want to hear from you, amigo, we'll rattle your cage.
Ha ha ha!
Is that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted, but he got up, didn't he?
Ha ha ha!
What?
What?
Oh!
Towfield, I told you to keep these buzzards out of here!
Take it easy, moon.
You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just wanted to take a gander at the man of the hour.
Yeah.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card, moon.
I'm going to miss you.
Your family's here.
Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe,
Jimmy, gussie, and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy.
He thought you was really my family.
That's how I figured.
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
How you doing, Henry?
Well...
Roll it out.
Nothing like that, Henry.
We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too goddamn good on your own, Henry, did you?
Now, you should have stuck with us because we was going places, goddamn it!
What do you mean "was"?
All you got to do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get ourselves... yeah, but that's without my plans.
Ah, cut that out.
Big Abe, they're going to send me to the bone orchard.
If you got anything you want to give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your good-byes, boys.
Nice knowing you.
Yeah, coogan, sure.
You know, it just ain't right.
Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
The law's got to be changed, Henry.
Come on now, Clyde.
So long, moon.
Adios.
Oh...
Well, honey, least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had...
Except for maybe that circus feller.
Why does that always upset you so?
What the hell did you bring a thing like that up at a time like this for, hermine?
Shit!
Henry!
Henry!
Don't you worry none, moon.
I'll take care of this girl like she's my very own.
Come on, now.
Oh, Henry!
Henry!
Mr. Moon?
It's about that time.
What about my last meal?
You're smoking it.
Ha ha ha!
Hands behind your back, Mr. Moon.
He ain't for you, serene.
I wouldn't take you to a dogfight if you was the defending champ.
You oughtn't have done that,
Mr. Moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
You tell him about the ordinance?
No.
Why not?
I don't like him, and people I don't like
I don't tell nothing.
Goddamn it, towfield.
What ordinance?
What ordinance?
Sheriff pile?
Kyle.
We got this ordinance here.
It was passed after the civil war on account of a lot of our boys didn't come home, and the women was beginning to chew up the grass.
I feel sorry for the grass.
I'm feeling sorry for the women.
Anyhow, this ordinance states that any man short of being a murderer can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female, providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, too, as I recollect.
Sweet Jesus h.
Christ almighty!
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
I think there's a couple of things about me that I'd like for you to consider.
I don't need your insults.
Oh, I agree with you completely, but you got to take into consideration a man can get a little irritated, and he can act like the dickens when he's about to pull hemp.
Buzzards, huh?
Well, buzzards can fly, and they keep the desert clean.
I cook!
I cook like the son-of-a-bitch!
I mean, like the dickens!
Oh!
Hello, son.
Go to hell.
I understand.
Be quiet!
Shh!
Henry Lloyd Moon, you've been found guilty of horse thievery and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this.
I want to tell you good people of longhorn...
Especially you lovely ladies, that the old saying...
"you can't judge a book by its cover"... it's true.
It's true.
Some books is all scruffed up on the outside, but when you turn around and look inside, why, the words is...
Just...
Wonderful.
Is that it, moon?
Well, isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The lord is my Shepherd.
"I shall not want.
Aw...
"He maketh me to lie down
"in green pastures.
"He leadeth me
"beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul."
That's not right.
"The lord is my Shepherd.
"I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down.
"In green pastures.
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me
"beside the still waters.
Yea, though I walk through the valley..."
oh!
I'm a veteran of the great civil war!
The only reason why I turned to crime is there wasn't no jobs... not one single job for a man that risked his life for the country...
"Thou anointest my head..."
and the confederacy!
This one's dumb.
He'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the lord forever."
Bullshit!
He's ready to go!
Stop!
I'll take him.
Florence.
Now... ah!
Don't you think that you're a mite too elderly to be taking on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran.
He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this son-bitching blindfold off me and let me see my bride!
Where is she?
Florence!
Aah!
Florence!
Ah ha ha!
Ah!
Mrs. Henry moon, let me look at you.
Stand back, folks.
Florence.
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
I think I made her dizzy.
Down she go, up you go!
Is she dead?
At least she died happy.
Then I'll take him.
Julia, what are you saying?
He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you were hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff Kyle, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink!
You want him?
According to the law I can claim him, right?
I asked you out 10 times.
What do I get?
A flap of your umbrella.
Shit!
All right.
Ok, Julia.
Mr. Moon, what do you say?
Well, I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off, but...
What the hell.
Fine by me.
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't taking' Frank tokin's business tonight.
Somebody's taking his business, or we ain't got no business.
Wonderful!
Aha!
Now, Mr. Moon, no drinking.
No gambling.
No wife-beating.
No alley-catting, whatnot, and what have you.
You've got to mind her.
If you try running, there will be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you.
Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
Adios!
Bienvenidos!
See?
I told you he had a plan.
You'll dance in the air, you son-of-a-bitch...
For stealing' my girl!
Miss, ah...
In case you want to know who you're dealing with...
I used to ride with quantrell's raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
'Course a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find.
You were standin' in front of the whole town with a rope around your neck.
Yeah.
You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
I'm sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, rover.
That's grover.
Grover.
This is where I live.
Well, Julia, it ain't much, but it's a start.
Well, I guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
Well then, it, uh...
Looks like an opera house.
Please take your clothes off,
Mr. Moon.
Don't sit there.
Here.
Put these on.
These is, uh...
These are work clothes.
That's right.
Well, I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine?
In Texas?
It's going to be.
Looks like mice been into it.
First you'll begin crevassing, then crosscut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't, uh, familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Huh?
Then you insert the drill like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Simple.
Yeah.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blisters easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Uh...
Mr. Moon... pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck, so let's not waste any more time.
Well,
I'll do all I can do, but that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How did you come into this place?
It was my father's.
Did he believe in this gold mine?
He believed, but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
How's about a little dessert?
Said, uh...
How's about a little dessert?
I heard you the first time.
You didn't answer me the first time.
Um...
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time that you had a man?
I hope you don't mind working in confined spaces because tomorrow we start tunneling.
Goddamn!
I should have known.
You can always tell a virgin on account of the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
Ha ha ha!
See, I got this theory on virgins... that they always look peaked and grouchy on account of they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back, but in my time, I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Oh, listen.
Don't, uh, let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is, uh...
Hee hee ha hee!
I'll be outside in the barn if you feel like getting acquainted, or, uh, talking about tunneling.
And remember, nature is the great provider.
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh, goddamn.
Well, good morning, spot.
Get you some bacon?
Good morning, miss!
What's for breakfast?
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me.
I know how to pace myself.
If I want to...
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about...
Allday long.
Where are you supposed to set?
Where are you going?
Well...
I want to...
Take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacing' yourself.
You just go on trimming' your wicks.
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long!
All day long!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, lady!
No cabeza, no trabajo.
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
An awful lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the city of motherly love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
To Philadelphia?
Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
The pace suits me better... slow days and fast nights.
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw the lights and felt we wouldn't be intruding.
Oh, lorette, you're never intruding.
Uh, y'all remember my husband Henry.
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought along a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
I'll get us some tea.
Shall I help?
We'll help.
Don't be long, now.
We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to, especially now.
Look, honey, what lorette's trying to say is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Oh.
Since you've never been married before, we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, lorette.
Ha ha ha!
You know, I rode with quantrell... finest revolver gang in history till he died.
Quantrell died?
Last year.
Mmm.
That shorty...
He don't even ask.
He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take no for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night, he got all painted up like an Indian, and did he go on the warpath!
Woo woo woo!
Say, want to have yourself a really wild time?
Why don't you dress up like an Indian?
Ha!
Well, that sounds like it ought to be Julia's cup of tea.
Ha ha ha!
I guess I'll, uh, go on out and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
Uh-huh.
But if it should become one,
I have found that the best thing to do is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
How we doin', ladies?
Bye!
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Let's do it again real soon.
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well...
You know what they say... lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog.
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know,
I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air.
Why, it's poetry.
I think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon... all over America, people's going to be picking up chairs and setting them down.
It's going to be all your doing.
Julia...
What do you say we try canning some of them apricots?
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox
"and looking for two,
"hoping for the help of the lord.
"Why not get rid of all the oxen and count on the maker all the way?"
Very good.
I look forward to hearing it on Sunday.
Thank you.
Morning, ladies.
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night.
Yah!
Julia!
What in the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke.
No.
You don't understand.
A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Miss Tate, please step into the office.
It's, uh, Mrs. Moon.
Excuse me.
Miss Tate... why, you...
Henry.
I believe this is between Mr. Polty and myself.
Hey, moon!
It looks like the honeymoon is over!
Ha ha ha!
What's the matter, moon?
You're looking like a dog without a bone.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Hector.
Yeah?
Why don't you go down to the Mexican side of town and see what the beans is jumping on.
Beans?
Beans.
You know...
Polty's just another word for chicken.
Good one, towfield.
Who thought it up for you?
Come on!
Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
Because I'm in a good mood.
Well...
Then, uh, how's about a little snort?
¶
Hey, peachy.
Bottle of mash and two glasses, norvell.
Not for him.
What do you mean, not for me?
Sheriff's orders.
The sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks.
Ah!
You know, I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for?
Hell!
If you hadn't jerked me back across the border to my just deserts, so to speak, why, I'd never have been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why...
You sort of...
Introduced us.
Yeah, towfield...
Things is good.
You heard about them matches made in heaven, didn't you?
Well, I'm in one of them.
Goddamn it, moon!
You stole my girl!
Take it easy, towfield.
You're wrinkling my good-luck bandanna.
How's this... you give me the bottle, and I'll, uh, I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
She puts chairs up on the wall so's people can't sit on them.
What?
I can't go into it, towfield.
It's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Duck out back for a snort.
The trouble with Andrew Johnson is he's a damn mugwump.
Oh, don't mention that son-of-a-bitch's name.
Ugh!
Listen, amigo.
I don't ever want you to call me a bean again.
What the hell was that?
This is as difficult for me as it is for you, Julia.
Ha!
You know, a year ago last Christmas Eve,
I had to move 150 comanche souls off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey?
You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
What do you mean?
This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it concerns me.
The railroad's taking over my land under eminent domain.
Chester, come on!
Eminent domain.
Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature to take away some poor folks' land?
I won't dignify that with an answer.
I ain't askin' for no dignification.
But I do find it interesting that you, uh, prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, moon.
I'm sorry, Julia, but unless I am advised otherwise,
I'll be out to survey.
You know...
Polty's just another way of saying chicken.

I love you!
Who's there?
What are you doing?
Oh, Julia!
I was just out here surveying.
You liar!
You were spying on me!
Me?
I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia, I swear on my honor
I didn't see a thing!
It's not what you think!
You old... what's going on here?
Nothing.
You bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying.
There's my equipment... my tripod, my maps, et cetera.
I caught you, didn't I?
I swear, no.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then apologize.
I apologize.
All right.
Now eminent domain your ass out of here.
Ha ha ha!
Woo, nasty.
Ooh!
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know.
Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
That's all you like to do.
No, that ain't all I like to do.
Uh-uh, moon.
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Ha ha ha!
Ooh!
Nasty!
Damn.
A norther.
It's a norther.
Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Julia...
An outlaw doesn't know how to take no for an answer.
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
Huh?
What am I doing?
Oh, I guess I was dreaming about a tunnel or something.
Get up!
You got me drunk.
I don't remember a thing!
I didn't get you drunk!
Aah!
I will not have that kind of talk in my house!
Hey!
You tricked me!
I didn't trick you.
You get your clothes and get out!
There's work to do!
Oh.
I get it.
You're so afraid that you're going to like that...
That you're going to forget about the gold and Philadelphia!
You get your clothes, and you get out of here!
Son-of-a-bitch!
I was right all these years!
There ain't a lady that knows how to appreciate a man.
No goddamn...
Unnatural questions!
"How did it feel?"
Damn it!
I feel sorry for the poor son-of-a-bitch that, son-of-a-bitch that winds up with you!
Nice being married to you!
Ugh!
Uh!
Oh!
You haven't got a plugged nickel!
You haven't even got a gun!
Yeah!
Uh!
You won't get 20 Miles before a posse will come and get you and string you up!
The only reason why I slept with you was so you'd keep on working!
I hope they hang you!
You...
Oh!
Not the curtain!
You wouldn't dare!
Well...
I hadn't thought of it, but now that you mention it, up in San Francisco,
I seen some Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilization.
They understand things about pleasure that,
I've never even thought of.
One thing for sure...
We ain't had a boring marriage.
¶
Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
But 15 days?
That's not fair.
Tell it to the railroad.
We've been here since '43.
Well, them's the breaks.
Come on!
Damn black goo!
Giddy-up!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Giddy-up!
Huh!
Well...
I was just going into town to...
Buy an anvil.
Julia?
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Uh, me and the little woman haven't been getting along of late.
Don't go in there!
Oh!
Julia?
Julia?
Where's the doctor?
What's the matter, dear?
Where's the doctor?
Doctor...
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I never did get over there.
This pea brain grabbed me and stuck me in an animal wagon.
It would have broke your heart to see it, honey.
You never told me about no doctor.
You never asked me about no doctor.
Is something wrong, Julia?
Female trouble.
Oh...
The vapors.
I better put you to bed, darling.
I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell did you pick him up for, towfield?
He was dressed up like a Mexican.
You can't arrest a man for that.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
Julia.
I told him.
I told you, but, no, you would...
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not.
Yeah.
I can see it.
Them eyes ain't angry.
They're relieved, and they ain't bloodshot no more.
I wanted you back for one reason... to work the mine.
Naw.
You missed the old man in the moon.
Ha ha ha!
Hell, I got my faults.
I admit it, but...
Aw, hell, I got my ways, too.
Yeah, I...
I missed you a little bit, too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border,
I couldn't stop but thinking nobody's ever saved my life before.
And I just couldn't leave you in your time of need of me.
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out.
I think I'll take a poca siesta.
Oh, you don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
Bats.
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up, too.
Didn't I want to ride with the younger gang, and they wouldn't have me?
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a younger.
My feelings was hurt, but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw, you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good lord almighty, I've found gold!
Gold!
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I been here.
I know it's around here somewheres.
I can feel it!
I don't see nothing.
It's here.
Believe me.
It's here.
Where?
Goddamn!
Ha ha ha!
Gold.
Look at that!
Gold!
Oh!
Gold!
Goddamn, it's all over everything.
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, honey, kiss me.
I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich.
I knew it.
You wait long enough, and pretty soon, down it's going to come right on you.
Like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know,
I'm going to get my initials put on my saddle, in gold.
They like it that way in Mexico.
Alls we got to do now is...
Deposit this first bunch in the bank and then...
"we"?
What do you mean, "we"?
What are you saying?
Well, just that, in all fairness,
I played a part in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd have never struck it if it wasn't for me.
Correcto?
So?
So...
Ha ha!
Where's my... where's my share in the stake?
Ha ha!
You're right.
I'll give you 10%.
Ha ha ha!
You don't understand.
You see, sharing is giving to each other.
50%.
We'll talk about it later.
Oh, all right, all right, all right.
Uh, 25%, and we can...
Stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny actually depositing something in a bank, huh, moon?
Yeah!
It's a whole new experience for me.
That's it.
Sure are sorry to have you and Miriam leaving us.
Thank you, Mrs. Haber, but with the railroad and this black stuff springing up everywheres, a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Ohhh!
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
Well, I'll guard it with my life.
Aw, you can do better than that, whitey.
Henry Lloyd moon at the bank.
Hmm.
Want one of these?
Sure.
Goddamn it.
I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the younger gang.
Doll,
I think I'll buy me a little cantina.
South of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey, I'm going to be a patron.
Tequila...
Cards...
Senoritas...
Hey.
Wait till the domingi sisters get a load of me!
Ha ha ha!
"Buenas noches, seÃ±or moon.
Como esta usted, seÃ±or moon?"
"Muy bien, gracias.
Y usted?"
Ha ha ha!
Woo!
Don't do that.
You're acting foolish.
Maybe you ought to try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
50%?
You're going to give me... 50%?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're going to put it that way.
Yeah.
I don't know how to...
Say this, Henry...
But...
I think I got...
Greedy and selfish living alone so long.
Well...
That's how you get.
Once you get started...
You don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
¶
Dios mio!
Friends of yours?
Used to be.
What are they doing here?
Good question.
Well, ha ha!
Sorry to keep you all waiting, but, uh...
Me and the missis was just playing a little game of fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree, moon.
Oh, did you?
Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was, uh, going to have you all out.
Well, you damn sure got your wish, didn't you?
Ha ha ha!
I damn sure did.
Ain't you going to ask us in, Henry?
Why, sure, honey pie.
Mi casa es su casa.
Don't you boys know how to wipe your feet?
Hey, hog coogan!
Wipe your feet off.
Hope you like Taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me big Abe.
Old Henry still snore in his sleep?
¶
I want them out of here!
Not as much as I do.
Moon!
You want them to find out about the dust?
Ha ha ha ha!
Well!
Anybody hungry?
Hungry?
Shit, I could eat a frozen dog.
Ha ha ha!
Well, we'll go on out to the kitchen, and see if we got one already froze.
Ha ha ha!
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
Ha ha ha!
¶
Estufado del diablo!
A feast fit for a king.
That's his speciality.
Them female bullfeathers make it tasty.
Did you know that old Henry used to cook for the raiders?
He cooked for quantrell's raiders?
No.
He never told me that.
I bet there's a lot of things he never told you.
Shit!
Abe!
Goddamn, Abe.
Jesus Christ!
You'll loosen my molar up!
¶
¶ Grab your girl, now pull on her mane ¶
yahoo!
Just play along a little while longer.
Well, you go on ahead.
I don't want to spoil your fun.
Well, I ain't having a good time.
I swear I ain't.
I'm just trying to throw them off the track.
They wouldn't know it was me if I wasn't acting wild and...
Aw...
Forget about all this.
Get in there and have a good time.
Act foolish!
Woo!
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶
¶ awaken to me ¶
¶ beautiful dreamer ¶
¶ waken to me ¶
¶ starlight and dewdrops are waitin' for thee ¶

This ain't no real marriage.
Come on.
Meet me tonight, huh?
I'll give you my old coyote call.
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶ remember?
A-woo... not now.
¶ To me ¶
woo hoo!
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
Nope.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow for the tooth fairy?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Tooth fairy!
You won't get nothing for his molar.
Well, come on, boys.
Let's help big Abe find his goddamn molar.
No!
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Moon, let's you and me go buy big Abe a whole damn set of gold teeth!
Ha ha!
You'll ruin everything acting like a goddamn fool.
I don't give a damn what anybody says!
I'm a gentleman!
And I'm not going to throw up in this here house.
I'm going outside to throw up 'cause I...
I respect your house.
Um...
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house any old time.
Ha ha ha!
Goddamn gold!
Gold!
That son-of-a-bitch is keeping gold from us.
God almighty.
Son-of-a-bitch.
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing?
You don't understand outlaws!
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and start singing your damn fool head off!
Hog liked my singing.
That's why they call him hog!
A-woo!
A-woo!
Aah!
Damn, hermine.
Quit your goddamn coyote calling.
I'm here.
Your wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
She just had a little too much bug-juice.
Ha ha ha!
I figure you ain't had much of anything of anything in a long time.
How's come you and the boys decided to stop by tonight?
I want to make it good for you, Henry.
Honey, you ain't hearing what I'm asking.
What was the question?
I don't want to hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling, but I told you things has changed.
Crawl in, Henry.
See what I got.
Hermine, you ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell.
We had some times together that I'll never forget.
But, hermine, now I'm took.
Henry.
Aah!
Hold it.
That's enough.
Uh...
Don't shoot.
Vamoose.
Well...
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why did you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you ain't going to believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of hermine.
That wasn't all you were trying to get off of her.
All I wanted to know was if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about that damn gold than about me.
That ain't true.
I could have done what you think, but I didn't.
I don't believe you didn't.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman!
You take her, but you forget all about the gold.
People can't afford business partners that cheat on them.
We made an agreement.
And I'm breaking it.
You can't do that to me.
I just did.
That tears it.
Going to put the old double "x" to Henry moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
You want your gun back, moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
What gold?
That gold there.
That's real gold!
Where is it?
You ain't as ignorant as you look, are you?
Come on in.
How much we got here?
Enough.
In fact, I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure, you was.
We're going to hit the longhorn bank.
There ain't nothing in that chicken-feed bank but sun-filled windows.
And all the little lady's gold.
Let's hit her in the morning.
Not yet.
Got a plan?
I'm going to make that woman sorry she ever said, "I do."
I tell you, he's hiding something from us.
I don't think so.
I know so.
I was certain he had a plan.
Me, too, but I don't know if we're going to be in it.
Let's keep a watch on the son-of-a-bitch.
Come on, gang!
You...
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I've got nothing to say.
I keep my word.
Julia!
Honey!
Moon!
Honey, are you all right?
Goddamn!
You all right?
Yes.
Oh!
All right.
Can you stand there?
Yes.
O.K. All right.
You all right?
Well, I've been better.
Easy.
Easy.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Here, hold this.
You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take us a little Spanish pause.
Henry Lloyd?
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but if we're going to die,
I...
I want it to be as partners.
50/50.
We was a good team.
Good?
Shit.
We were the best.
Honey pie...
Moon, I've been thinking.
Since we're going to go anyway, why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Moon, tie me up.
Julia...
We're alive.
I've been watching you, Henry.
Figured.
Ain't you up early?
We don't hit the bank till 10:00.
Well, there's been a little change in plans.
Well, I got to tell big Abe.
You got to do what you got to do.
I'll never forget you, hermine.
You was the first woman
I didn't have to pay for.
Adios.
You're a mite early, compadre.
I want to make a withdrawal.
Your better half has to do that.
Ordinance husbands aren't allowed to make withdrawals.
Besides, we're closed.
You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there in the bin.
Hurry up, whitey.
I never figured you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, whitey.
Hyah!
Julia!
Julia?
Grover, where is Julia at?
Julia!
Goddamn.
Rocks.
Goddamn, honey pie.
Freeze, moon!
Mr. Moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
I guess he ain't heard the news.
Ha ha ha!
What news?
Your wife sold her property to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
When?
Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're on your way to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, moon.
You're on your way to meet senor Peter.
Come out, moon.
We know you got it!
I ain't got nothing!
We don't believe you!
Henry, who the hell is that?
The ex-moon gang.
Chinga La luna!
If they want a gunfight, they picked the wrong hombresto mess with!
Goddamn you!
Watch it, big Abe!
Ok. 1, 2, 3!
When did she leave?
Why should I tell you?
About a half-hour ago.
Now!
Moon.
Shoot back.
Yes, sir, this is mighty strange stuff.
Muriel dropped a lantern in a puddle of it the other night, and the whole farm 'bout near went up in flame!
Burned half the hair off of my head.
Stunk for two weeks.
The railroad said they've got no use for it, so I thought I'd take samples back east and maybe sell it.
What do you think, miss Julia?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Standard.
I didn't hear what you said.
Hyah!
Aah!
Whoa in there!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Hold up in there.
All right.
Stay calm.
Whoa.
Whoa.
All right.
Step down, Julia.
Whoa.
Cotton, that son-of- a-bitch can shoot.
He rode with quantrell.
Come on, you've run far enough.
Come on, now.
I'm losing my patience.
You ain't taking my gold!
They discovered gold!
Nah.
They had a little too much bug-juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I supposed to write?
"Good luck, Henry and hermine"?
I was going to explain everything.
See, I...
Mr. Moon.
Are you robbing this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle, or I'll blow everybody into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr. Moon.
It's all right, sheriff.
You go on ahead.
He's just trying to impress me.
Are you sure, Julia?
Oh.
Well...
You two ought to try and get along, then.
We all had to.
Hyah!
My heart froze when I came home and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up.
Oh!
Thank you, moon.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure, you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways...
First, let's get used to being rich.
Oh, you Rio Grande!
Get in there.
Viva Mexico!
Viva Mexico!
This here's Mexican dirt.
You can't touch me.
Thought you'd get me?
You're a disgrace to the Confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down.
Get up!
This is Mexican territory.
He gets across the river and his horse faints on him!
This ain't fair, goddamn it.
This ain't fair.
This ain't fair.
Good Lord.
They're stringing up old Speed.
I have here a very fine animal once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey!
I still own that horse.
When we want to hear from you, amigo, we'll rattle your cage.
Ain't that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted.
But he got up, didn't he?
What?
What?
Towfield, I said keep these buzzards out.
Take it easy, Moon.
You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just want to see the man of the hour.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card, Moon.
I'm gonna miss you.
Your family's here.
Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe, Jimmy,
Gussy and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy.
He thought you were really my family.
So I figured...
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
- How ya doin', Henry?
- Well roll it out.
- Nothing like that, Henry.
- We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too good on your own, Henry.
You should've stuck with us.
We was going places, goddamn it.
What do you mean, "was"?
All you gotta do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get shot.
Yeah, but that's without my plan.
Cut that out.
Big Abe, they're gonna send me to the bone orchard.
If you got anything you want to give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your goodbyes, boys.
- Nice knowing you.
- Yeah, Coogan, sure.
It just ain't right.
Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
The law's gotta be changed, Henry.
Go on outside.
So long, Moon.
Adios.
Well, honey, at least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had.
Except maybe that circus fella.
- Why does that always upset you?
- Why bring that up now, Hermine?
- Shit!
- Oh, Henry.
Don't worry, Moon.
I'm gonna take care of this girl like she's my very own.
- Come on, honey.
- Oh, Henry.
Mr Moon?
It's about that time.
- What about my last meal?
- You're smoking it.
Hands behind your back, Mr Moon.
He ain't for you.
I wouldn't take you to a dog fight if you was the defending champ.
You oughtn't to have done that, Mr Moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
- You tell him about the ordinance?
- No.
Why not?
People I don't like, I don't tell nothing.
- Goddamn it, Towfield.
- What ordinance?
- What ordinance, Sheriff Pile?
- Kyle.
We got this ordinance here, passed after the Civil War, because a lot of our boys didn't come home and the women was chewing up the grass.
- I feel sorry for the grass.
- I feel sorry for the women.
This ordinance says any man, short of a murderer, can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female, providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, as I recall.
Sweet Jesus H Christ Almighty!
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
There's a couple of things about me that I'd like you to consider.
- I don't need your insults.
- I agree completely.
But you've gotta take into consideration that a man can get a little irritated and act like the dickens when he's about to die.
- Buzzards, huh?
- Well, buzzards can fly.
And they keep the desert clean.
I cook.
I cook like a sonofabitch.
I mean like the dickens.
- Hello, son.
- Go to hell.
I understand.
Henry Lloyd Moon, you've been found guilty of horse thievery and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this:
I wanna tell you good people of Longhorn, especially you lovely ladies, that the old saying, "You can't judge a book by its cover", it's true.
Some books are all scruffed up on the outside, but when you turn around and look inside, why, the words is just wonderful.
Is that it, Moon?
Isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.
"He restoreth my soul. "
That's not right.
"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.
"Yea, though I walk through the valley... "
I'm a veteran of the great Civil War.
The only reason why I turned to crime was there wasn't no jobs.
Not one single job for a man who risked his life for his country.
In the Confederacy!
This one's dumb, he'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. "
Bullshit!
Ready to go.
Stop!
I'll take him.
Florence!
Now...
Don't you think that you're a mite too elderly to take on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran.
He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this son-bitchin' blindfold off me and let me see my bride.
Where is she?
Florence!
Florence!
Mrs Henry Moon.
Let me look at you.
- Stand back, folks.
- Florence!
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
- I made her dizzy.
- Down she go, up you go.
Is she dead?
Then I'll take him.
Julia, what are you saying?
He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you're hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink.
You want him?
The law says I can claim him, right?
I asked you out ten times.
What did I get?
A flap of your umbrella.
Shit!
All right.
OK, Julia.
Mr Moon, what do you say?
I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off, but hell, fine by me.
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't taking Frank Towfield's business tonight.
Somebody's taking his business, or we ain't got no business.
Now, Mr Moon: no drinking, no gambling, no wife-beating, no alley-cattin' and what have you.
You've got to mind her.
If you try running, there'll be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you.
Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
Adios!
See, I told you he had a plan.
You can dance in the air, you sonofabitch.
Stealing my girl.
Miss, in case you want to know who you're dealing with I used to ride with Quantrill's Raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well, look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
Of course, a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find, standing there with a rope around your neck.
Yeah.
You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
Sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, Rover.
That's Grover.
This is where I live.
Well, Julia.
It ain't much, but it's a start.
Guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
Well... it looks like the opera house.
Please take your clothes off, Mr Moon.
Don't sit there.
Here, put these on.
These is work clothes.
That's right.
But I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine?
In Texas?
It's gonna be.
Looks like mice bit into it.
First you'll begin crevassing, then cross-cut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Then you insert the drill.
Like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blister easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Mr Moon...
Pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck, so let's not waste any more time.
I'll do all I can do, but that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How'd you come into this place?
It was my father's.
Did he believe in this gold mine?
He believed, but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
How's about a little dessert?
I said, how's about a little dessert?
- I heard you the first time.
- You didn't answer me the first time.
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time you had a man?
I hope you don't mind confined spaces, tomorrow we start tunnelling.
Goddamn, I should've known.
You can always tell a virgin because the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
I got this theory on virgins, that they always look peaked and grouchy because they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back, but in my time I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Listen to me.
Don't let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is...
I'll be outside in the barn if you feel like getting acquainted, or talking about tunnelling.
And remember, nature is the great provider.
Goddamn.
Well, good morning, Spot.
Could use some bacon...
Morning, miss.
What's for breakfast?
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me, I know how to pace myself.
If I want to I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long.
Pace myself.
Where are you going?
I wanna take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacing yourself.
You just go on trimming your wicks.
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long.
All day long.
Hey, lady!
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
A lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the city of motherly love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
- To Philadelphia?
- Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
Pace suits me better.
Slow days and fast nights.
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw lights and felt we weren't intruding.
Oh, Laurette, you're never intruding.
You all remember my husband, Henry.
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
- I'll get us some tea.
- Shall I help?
We'll help.
Don't be long now.
We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to.
Especially now.
What Laurette is trying to say is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Oh.
Since you've never been married before, we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, Laurette.
You know, I rode with Quantrill.
Finest revolver gang in history, till he died.
Quantrill died?
Last year.
That Shorty, he don't even ask.
He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night he got all painted up like an Indian.
And did he go on the warpath!
Say, want to have yourself a really wild time?
Why not dress up like an Indian?
That sounds like it oughta be Julia's cup of tea.
I guess I'll go on out and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
But, if it should become one,
I have found that the best thing to do is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
How are we doing, ladies?
Bye.
- Thank you for the lovely gift.
- Let's do it again real soon.
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well you know what they say:
"Lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog. "
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know, I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air.
Why, it's poetry.
Think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon, all over America, people's gonna be picking up chairs and setting them down.
It's gonna be all your doing.
Julia what do you say we try canning some of them apricots?
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox
"and looking for two, hoping for the help of the Lord.
"Why not get rid of all the oxen
"and count on the Maker all the way?"
Very good.
- I look forward to hearing it on Sunday.
- Thank you.
Morning, ladies!
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night.
Julia!
What the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke?
No.
You don't understand.
A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Miss Tate.
Please step into the office.
It's Mrs Moon.
Excuse me.
Miss Tate...
- Why, you...
- Henry.
I believe this is between Mr Polty and myself.
Hey, Moon!
It looks like the honeymoon is over.
What's the matter, Moon?
You look like a dog without a bone.
- Hey, Hector.
- Si.
Why don't you go to the Mexican side of town, see what the beans is jumping on?
- Beans?
- Beans.
You know, Polty's just another word for chicken.
Good one, Towfield.
- Who thought it up for you?
- Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
'Cause I'm in a good mood.
Well, how's about a little snort?
Hey, Peachy.
Bottle of mash and two glasses, Norvell.
- Not for him.
- What do you mean?
- Sheriff's orders.
- Sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks!
You know, I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for?
Hell, if you hadn't jerked me back across the border to the just desserts, so to speak, why I'd never have been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why you sorta introduced us.
Yeah, Towfield... things is good.
You heard about matches made in heaven, didn't you?
- Well, I'm in one of 'em.
- Goddamn it, Moon!
You stole my girl.
Take it easy, Towfield.
You're wrinkling my good luck bandanna.
How's this?
You give me the bottle and I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
She puts chairs up on the wall so people can't sit on them.
What?
I can't go into it, Towfield, it's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Duck out back for a snort.
Listen, amigo, don't ever call me a bean again.
What the hell was that?
Bye, Moon.
This is as hard for me as it is for you.
A year ago last Christmas Eve,
I had to move 150 Comanche souls off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey?
You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
- What?
- This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it does me.
The railroad's taking over my land under eminent domain.
Eminent domain.
Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature to take away some poor folks' land?
- I won't dignify that with an answer.
- I ain't asking for no dignification.
But I do find it interesting that you prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, Moon.
I'm sorry, Julia, but unless I am advised otherwise,
I'll be out to survey.
You know Polty's just another way of saying chicken.
Whoa, William.
They may be bold maids till they die
Oh, yes.
Mother says I mustn't Oh, George, please George, not just yet
Oh, yes.
Swim, swim.
Be naked.
Oh, yes.
Oh, I love you.
Who's there?
What are you doing?
Oh, Julia.
I was just out here surveying.
You liar!
You were spying on me.
Me?
I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia.
I swear on my honour.
I didn't see a thing.
It's not what you think.
- You old...
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.
- Are you bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying.
There's my equipment.
My tripod, my maps...
Caught you, didn't I?
I swear, no.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then, apologise.
- I apologise.
- All right.
Now eminent domain your ass outta here!
Ooh, nasty!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know.
Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
- That's all you like to do.
- No.
That ain't all I like to do.
No, Moon.
Ooh, nasty!
Damn.
- It's northern.
- Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Outlaws don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
What am I doing?
I guess I was dreaming about tunnelling or something.
Out!
You got me drunk, I don't remember a thing.
- I didn't get you drunk.
- I will not have such talk here.
You tricked me!
I didn't trick you.
Get your clothes and get up, there's work to do.
Oh, I get it.
You're so afraid you're gonna like that, that you'll forget the gold and Philadelphia.
Get your clothes and get out of here.
Sonofabitch!
I was right.
All these years!
Them painted ladies knows how to appreciate a man.
They don't got unnatural questions. "How did it feel?"
Dammit.
I feel sorry for the poor sonofabitch that winds up with you.
Nice being married to you!
You haven't got a plug nickel.
You haven't even got a gun.
You won't get 20 miles before a posse'll get you and string you up.
I only slept with you so you'd keep on working.
I hope they hang you.
Not the curtain.
You wouldn't dare.
Well I hadn't thought of it, but now you mention it, up in San Francisco I seen some Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilisation.
They understand things about pleasure that I've never even thought of.
One thing's for sure: we ain't had a boring marriage.
Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
- But 15 days?
That's not fair.
- Tell it to the railroad.
- We've been here since '43.
- Them's the breaks.
Damn worthless black goo.
I was just going into town to buy an animal.
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Me and the little woman haven't been getting along.
Don't go in there!
Where's the doctor?
What's the matter?
Where's the doctor?
The doctor...
Oh, yeah...
I never got there.
This pea-brain grabbed me and stuck me in a wagon.
It would've broke your heart to see it.
- You never told me about no doctor.
- You never asked.
Is something wrong, Julia?
- Female trouble.
- Oh, the vapours.
- I'd better put you to bed, darling.
- I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell d'you pick him up for, Towfield?
- He was dressed like a Mexican.
- That's not illegal.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
I told him.
I told you but no, you wouldn't...
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not!
I can see it.
Them eyes ain't angry.
They're relieved.
And they ain't bloodshot.
- I wanted you back to work the mine.
- No.
You missed Old Man in the Moon.
Hell, I got my faults, I admit it, but...
Hell, I got my ways, too.
I missed you a little bit, too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border, I couldn't stop thinking that nobody's ever saved my life before.
I just couldn't leave you in your time of need... of me.
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out.
I think I'll take a poco siesta.
Oh, you don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
Rats.
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up, too.
I wanted to ride with the Younger Gang, they wouldn't have me.
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a Younger.
My feelings was hurt, but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good Lord Almighty, I found gold!
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I know it's around here somewhere.
I can feel it.
I don't see nothing.
It's here.
Believe me, it's here.
Goddamn!
Oh, goddamn!
Look at that, gold.
- It's all over everything.
- Moon, I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Honey, kiss me.
I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich!
You wait long enough, and pretty soon down it's gonna come right on you.
Like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know, I'm gonna get my initials put on my saddle in gold.
They like it that way down there in Mexico.
All we gotta do now is deposit this first bunch in the bank and then...
We?
What do you mean, we?
Just that, in all fairness, I played a part in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd've never struck it if it wasn't for me.
Correcto?
So?
So, where's my share of the stake?
You're right.
I'll give you ten percent.
You don't understand.
You see, sharing is giving to each other.
Fifty percent.
We'll talk about it later.
All right, all right.
Twenty-five percent and we can stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny depositing something in a bank, huh, Moon?
Yeah, it's a whole new experience for me.
We're sorry to have you and Miriam leave us.
Thank you.
What with the railroad and this black stuff springing up everywhere, a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
- I'll guard it with my life.
- You can do better than that, Whitey.
- Henry Lloyd Moon in the bank.
- Want one of these?
Sure.
Goddamn it.
I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the Younger Gang.
Darling, I think I'll buy me a little cantina south of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey.
I'm gonna be a patrón.
Tequila, cards, seńoritas.
Hey, wait till the Dominguine sisters get a load of me!
Don't do that, you're acting foolish.
Maybe you oughta try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
Fifty percent?
You're gonna give me fifty percent?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're gonna put it that way, yeah.
I don't know how to say this, Henry.
But I think I got greedy and selfish living alone so long.
Well that's how you get.
Once you get started you don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
- Friends of yours?
- Used to be.
- What are they doing here?
- Good question.
Well...
Sorry to keep you waiting, but me and the missus was playing fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree.
- Did you?
- Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was gonna have you all out.
- You sure got your wish, didn't you?
- I damn sure did.
- Ain't you gonna ask us in, Henry?
- Why, sure, honey pie.
- Don't you know how to wipe your feet?
- Hey, old Coogan.
Wipe your feet off.
Hope you like taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me Big Abe.
Ol' Henry still snore in his sleep?
I want them out of here.
- Not as much as I do.
- Moon!
You want them to find out about the dust?
Well...
Anybody hungry?
Hungry?
Shit, I could eat a frozen dog.
Well, we'll go to the kitchen and see if we've got one already froze.
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
A feast fit for a king.
That's his speciality.
Them pork bellies make it tasty.
Did you know Henry used to cook for the Raiders?
He cooked for Quantrill's Raiders?
No, he never told me that.
I bet there's a lot he never told you.
Shit!
Goddamn, Abe.
There's ladies present.
Easy, you'll loosen my molar up.
Just play along a little while longer.
You go, I don't want to spoil your fun.
I ain't having a good time, I swear it.
Just trying to throw them off the track.
Wouldn't be me if I wasn't acting wild.
Forget about all this and go and have a good time.
Act foolish.
Shit.
This ain't no real marriage.
Come on.
Meet me tonight, huh?
I'll give you my old coyote call.
Remember?
Not now.
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
No.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow for the tooth fairy?
You won't get nothing for it.
Come on boys, let's help Big Abe find his goddamn molar.
Wait, I have a better idea.
Moon, let's go and buy Big Abe a whole goddamn set of gold teeth.
You'll ruin everything, acting like a fool.
I don't give a goddamn what anybody says, I'm a gentleman.
And I'm not gonna throw up in this house,
I'm going outside to throw up, 'cause I respect your house.
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house any old time.
Goddamn gold, that sonofabitch is keeping gold from us.
Got no money!
Sonofabitch!
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find Big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing?
You don't understand outlaws.
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and sing your head off.
- Hog liked my singing.
- That's why they call him Hog!
Damn, Hermine!
Quit that goddamn coyote calling, I'm here.
You're wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
No, she's just had a little too much bug juice.
Now I figure you ain't had much of anything in a long time.
How come you and the boys decided to stop by tonight?
I wanna make it real good for you, Henry.
Hermine, you ain't hearing my question.
God!
- What was it?
- I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling and all, but I told you, things have changed.
Crawl in, Henry, and see what I got.
You ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell.
We had some times together I'll never forget.
But Hermine, now I'm took.
Hold it.
That's enough.
- Don't shoot.
- Vamoose.
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why'd you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you won't believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of Hermine.
That wasn't all you wanted to get off of her.
All I wanted to know is if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about the gold than about me.
That ain't true.
I could've done what you think I done, but I didn't.
I don't believe you.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman!
Take her, but forget about the gold.
People can't afford business partners that cheat on them.
- We made an agreement.
- And I'm breaking it.
- You can't do that to me.
- I just did.
That tears it.
Gotta put the old double X to Henry Moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
Now, you want your gun back, Moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
- What gold?
- That gold right there, where is it?
You aren't quite as ignorant as you look.
Come on in.
- How much we got here?
- Enough.
Actually, I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure you was.
We're gonna hit the Longhorn bank.
There ain't nothing in that chickenfeed bank but sun-filled windows.
- And all the little lady's gold.
- Let's hit her in the morning.
- Not yet.
- You got a plan?
I'm gonna make that woman sorry she ever said, "I do. "
- He's hiding something.
- I don't think so.
- I know so.
- I knew he had a plan.
Me, too, but I don't know if we're in on it.
- Let's keep a watch on him.
- Come on, gang.
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I got nothing to say.
I keep my word.
Honey?
Honey, are you all right?
Goddamn.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Watch it.
That's it, all right.
- Can you stand there?
- Yes.
OK, there's a light.
- You all right?
- Well, I been better.
It's all right, nothing's gonna happen to you.
Here, hold this.
You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take a little Spanish pause.
Now...
Henry Lloyd?
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but if we're going to die, I want it to be as partners.
Fifty-fifty.
We was a good team.
Good?
Shit, we were the best.
- Honey pie.
- Moon I been thinking, since we're gonna go anyway, why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Tie me up.
We're alive!
- I been watching you, Henry.
- Figured.
Ain't you up a little early?
We don't hit the bank till ten.
There's been a little change in plans.
I gotta tell Big Abe.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
I'll never forget you, Hermine.
You was the first woman I didn't have to pay for.
Adios.
- You're a mite early, compadre.
- I wanna make a withdrawal.
Your wife will have to do that.
Us ordinance husbands aren't allowed to.
- Besides, we're closed.
- You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there.
Hurry up, buddy.
Cover that up.
I never thought you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, Whitey.
Grover, where's Julia?
Damn.
Rocks.
Damn, honey pie.
Reach, Moon.
Mr Moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
Guess he ain't heard the news.
- What news?
- Your wife sold up to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
- When?
- Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're going to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, Moon.
You're going to meet senior Peter.
- We know you got it.
- I ain't got nothing.
We don't believe you.
- Ain't got what?
Who's that?
- The ex-Moon Gang.
They picked the wrong hombres to mess with.
Watch it, Big Abe.
OK.
One, two, three!
- When did she leave?
- Why should I tell you?
About a half hour ago.
Now!
Moon, shoot back.
Yessum, this is mighty strange stuff.
Miriam dropped the lantern in some the other night, and the whole farm near went up in flames.
- Burned half the hair off my head.
- It stunk for two weeks.
The railroad has no use for it.
So I thought I'd take these samples East and maybe sell it.
What do you think, Miss Julia?
I'm sorry, Mr Standard.
I didn't hear what you said.
Drop that gun.
Hold it there!
Hold it there!
All right, stay calm.
All right.
Step down, Julia.
That sonofabitch can shoot.
He rode with Quantrill.
Come on.
You've run far enough.
Come on, now.
I'm losing my patience.
- You ain't taking my gold!
- Hey, they discovered gold!
No, they just had too much bug juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I meant to write, "Good luck Henry and Hermine"?
I was gonna explain everything...
Are you gonna rob this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle, or I'll blow everybody into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr Moon.
It's all right, Sheriff.
You go on ahead.
He's just trying to impress me.
Are you sure, Julia?
Well... you two try and get along, then.
We all had to.
My heart froze when I came home and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up with it.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways first, let's get used to being rich.
Oh, you Rio Grande!
Get in there.
V¡va Méx¡co!
V¡va Méx¡co!
This here's Mexican dirt.
You can't touch me.
Thought you'd get me?
You're a disgrace to the Confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down.
Get up!
This is Mexican territory.
He gets across the river and his horse faints on him!
This ain't fair, goddamn it.
This ain't fair.
This ain't fair.
Good Lord.
They're stringing up old Speed.
I have here a very fine animal once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey!
I still own that horse.
When we want to hear from you, amigo, we'll rattle your cage.
Ain't that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted.
But he got up, didn't he?
What?
What?
Towfield, I said keep these buzzards out.
Take it easy, Moon.
You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just want to see the man of the hour.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card, Moon.
I'm gonna miss you.
Your family's here.
Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe, Jimmy,
Gussy and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy.
He thought you were really my family.
So I figured...
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
- How ya doin', Henry?
- Well roll it out.
- Nothing like that, Henry.
- We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too good on your own, Henry.
You should've stuck with us.
We was going places, goddamn it.
What do you mean, "was"?
All you gotta do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get shot.
Yeah, but that's without my plan.
Cut that out.
Big Abe, they're gonna send me to the bone orchard.
If you got anything you want to give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your goodbyes, boys.
- Nice knowing you.
- Yeah, Coogan, sure.
It just ain't right.
Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
The law's gotta be changed, Henry.
Go on outside.
So long, Moon.
Adios.
Well, honey, at least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had.
Except maybe that circus fella.
- Why does that always upset you?
- Why bring that up now, Hermine?
- Shit!
- Oh, Henry.
Don't worry, Moon.
I'm gonna take care of this girl like she's my very own.
- Come on, honey.
- Oh, Henry.
Mr Moon?
It's about that time.
- What about my last meal?
- You're smoking it.
Hands behind your back, Mr Moon.
He ain't for you.
I wouldn't take you to a dog fight if you was the defending champ.
You oughtn't to have done that, Mr Moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
- You tell him about the ordinance?
- No.
Why not?
People I don't like, I don't tell nothing.
- Goddamn it, Towfield.
- What ordinance?
- What ordinance, Sheriff Pile?
- Kyle.
We got this ordinance here, passed after the Civil War, because a lot of our boys didn't come home and the women was chewing up the grass.
- I feel sorry for the grass.
- I feel sorry for the women.
This ordinance says any man, short of a murderer, can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female, providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, as I recall.
Sweet Jesus H Christ Almighty!
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
There's a couple of things about me that I'd like you to consider.
- I don't need your insults.
- I agree completely.
But you've gotta take into consideration that a man can get a little irritated and act like the dickens when he's about to die.
- Buzzards, huh?
- Well, buzzards can fly.
And they keep the desert clean.
I cook.
I cook like a sonofabitch.
I mean like the dickens.
- Hello, son.
- Go to hell.
I understand.
Henry Lloyd Moon, you've been found guilty of horse thievery and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this:
I wanna tell you good people of Longhorn, especially you lovely ladies, that the old saying, "You can't judge a book by its cover", it's true.
Some books are all scruffed up on the outside, but when you turn around and look inside, why, the words is just wonderful.
Is that it, Moon?
Isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.
"He restoreth my soul. "
That's not right.
"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.
"Yea, though I walk through the valley... "
I'm a veteran of the great Civil War.
The only reason why I turned to crime was there wasn't no jobs.
Not one single job for a man who risked his life for his country.
In the Confederacy!
This one's dumb, he'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. "
Bullshit!
Ready to go.
Stop!
I'll take him.
Florence!
Now...
Don't you think that you're a mite too elderly to take on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran.
He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this son-bitchin' blindfold off me and let me see my bride.
Where is she?
Florence!
Florence!
Mrs Henry Moon.
Let me look at you.
- Stand back, folks.
- Florence!
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
- I made her dizzy.
- Down she go, up you go.
Is she dead?
Then I'll take him.
Julia, what are you saying?
He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you're hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink.
You want him?
The law says I can claim him, right?
I asked you out ten times.
What did I get?
A flap of your umbrella.
Shit!
All right.
OK, Julia.
Mr Moon, what do you say?
I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off, but hell, fine by me.
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't taking Frank Towfield's business tonight.
Somebody's taking his business, or we ain't got no business.
Now, Mr Moon: no drinking, no gambling, no wife-beating, no alley-cattin' and what have you.
You've got to mind her.
If you try running, there'll be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you.
Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
Adios!
See, I told you he had a plan.
You can dance in the air, you sonofabitch.
Stealing my girl.
Miss, in case you want to know who you're dealing with I used to ride with Quantrill's Raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well, look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
Of course, a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find, standing there with a rope around your neck.
Yeah.
You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
Sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, Rover.
That's Grover.
This is where I live.
Well, Julia.
It ain't much, but it's a start.
Guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
Well... it looks like the opera house.
Please take your clothes off, Mr Moon.
Don't sit there.
Here, put these on.
These is work clothes.
That's right.
But I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine?
In Texas?
It's gonna be.
Looks like mice bit into it.
First you'll begin crevassing, then cross-cut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Then you insert the drill.
Like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blister easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Mr Moon...
Pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck, so let's not waste any more time.
I'll do all I can do, but that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How'd you come into this place?
It was my father's.
Did he believe in this gold mine?
He believed, but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
How's about a little dessert?
I said, how's about a little dessert?
- I heard you the first time.
- You didn't answer me the first time.
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time you had a man?
I hope you don't mind confined spaces, tomorrow we start tunnelling.
Goddamn, I should've known.
You can always tell a virgin because the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
I got this theory on virgins, that they always look peaked and grouchy because they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back, but in my time I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Listen to me.
Don't let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is...
I'll be outside in the barn if you feel like getting acquainted, or talking about tunnelling.
And remember, nature is the great provider.
Goddamn.
Well, good morning, Spot.
Could use some bacon...
Morning, miss.
What's for breakfast?
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me, I know how to pace myself.
If I want to I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long.
Pace myself.
Where are you going?
I wanna take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacing yourself.
You just go on trimming your wicks.
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long.
All day long.
Hey, lady!
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
A lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the city of motherly love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
- To Philadelphia?
- Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
Pace suits me better.
Slow days and fast nights.
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw lights and felt we weren't intruding.
Oh, Laurette, you're never intruding.
You all remember my husband, Henry.
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
- I'll get us some tea.
- Shall I help?
We'll help.
Don't be long now.
We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to.
Especially now.
What Laurette is trying to say is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Oh.
Since you've never been married before, we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, Laurette.
You know, I rode with Quantrill.
Finest revolver gang in history, till he died.
Quantrill died?
Last year.
That Shorty, he don't even ask.
He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night he got all painted up like an Indian.
And did he go on the warpath!
Say, want to have yourself a really wild time?
Why not dress up like an Indian?
That sounds like it oughta be Julia's cup of tea.
I guess I'll go on out and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
But, if it should become one,
I have found that the best thing to do is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
How are we doing, ladies?
Bye.
- Thank you for the lovely gift.
- Let's do it again real soon.
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well you know what they say:
"Lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog. "
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know, I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air.
Why, it's poetry.
Think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon, all over America, people's gonna be picking up chairs and setting them down.
It's gonna be all your doing.
Julia what do you say we try canning some of them apricots?
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox
"and looking for two, hoping for the help of the Lord.
"Why not get rid of all the oxen
"and count on the Maker all the way?"
Very good.
- I look forward to hearing it on Sunday.
- Thank you.
Morning, ladies!
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night.
Julia!
What the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke?
No.
You don't understand.
A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Miss Tate.
Please step into the office.
It's Mrs Moon.
Excuse me.
Miss Tate...
- Why, you...
- Henry.
I believe this is between Mr Polty and myself.
Hey, Moon!
It looks like the honeymoon is over.
What's the matter, Moon?
You look like a dog without a bone.
- Hey, Hector.
- Si.
Why don't you go to the Mexican side of town, see what the beans is jumping on?
- Beans?
- Beans.
You know, Polty's just another word for chicken.
Good one, Towfield.
- Who thought it up for you?
- Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
'Cause I'm in a good mood.
Well, how's about a little snort?
Hey, Peachy.
Bottle of mash and two glasses, Norvell.
- Not for him.
- What do you mean?
- Sheriff's orders.
- Sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks!
You know, I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for?
Hell, if you hadn't jerked me back across the border to the just desserts, so to speak, why I'd never have been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why you sorta introduced us.
Yeah, Towfield... things is good.
You heard about matches made in heaven, didn't you?
- Well, I'm in one of 'em.
- Goddamn it, Moon!
You stole my girl.
Take it easy, Towfield.
You're wrinkling my good luck bandanna.
How's this?
You give me the bottle and I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
She puts chairs up on the wall so people can't sit on them.
What?
I can't go into it, Towfield, it's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Duck out back for a snort.
Listen, amigo, don't ever call me a bean again.
What the hell was that?
Bye, Moon.
This is as hard for me as it is for you.
A year ago last Christmas Eve,
I had to move 150 Comanche souls off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey?
You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
- What?
- This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it does me.
The railroad's taking over my land under eminent domain.
Eminent domain.
Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature to take away some poor folks' land?
- I won't dignify that with an answer.
- I ain't asking for no dignification.
But I do find it interesting that you prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, Moon.
I'm sorry, Julia, but unless I am advised otherwise,
I'll be out to survey.
You know Polty's just another way of saying chicken.
Whoa, William.
They may be bold maids till they die
Oh, yes.
Mother says I mustn't Oh, George, please George, not just yet
Oh, yes.
Swim, swim.
Be naked.
Oh, yes.
Oh, I love you.
Who's there?
What are you doing?
Oh, Julia.
I was just out here surveying.
You liar!
You were spying on me.
Me?
I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia.
I swear on my honour.
I didn't see a thing.
It's not what you think.
- You old...
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.
- Are you bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying.
There's my equipment.
My tripod, my maps...
Caught you, didn't I?
I swear, no.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then, apologise.
- I apologise.
- All right.
Now eminent domain your ass outta here!
Ooh, nasty!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know.
Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
- That's all you like to do.
- No.
That ain't all I like to do.
No, Moon.
Ooh, nasty!
Damn.
- It's northern.
- Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Outlaws don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
What am I doing?
I guess I was dreaming about tunnelling or something.
Out!
You got me drunk, I don't remember a thing.
- I didn't get you drunk.
- I will not have such talk here.
You tricked me!
I didn't trick you.
Get your clothes and get up, there's work to do.
Oh, I get it.
You're so afraid you're gonna like that, that you'll forget the gold and Philadelphia.
Get your clothes and get out of here.
Sonofabitch!
I was right.
All these years!
Them painted ladies knows how to appreciate a man.
They don't got unnatural questions. "How did it feel?"
Dammit.
I feel sorry for the poor sonofabitch that winds up with you.
Nice being married to you!
You haven't got a plug nickel.
You haven't even got a gun.
You won't get 20 miles before a posse'll get you and string you up.
I only slept with you so you'd keep on working.
I hope they hang you.
Not the curtain.
You wouldn't dare.
Well I hadn't thought of it, but now you mention it, up in San Francisco I seen some Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilisation.
They understand things about pleasure that I've never even thought of.
One thing's for sure: we ain't had a boring marriage.
Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
- But 15 days?
That's not fair.
- Tell it to the railroad.
- We've been here since '43.
- Them's the breaks.
Damn worthless black goo.
I was just going into town to buy an animal.
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Me and the little woman haven't been getting along.
Don't go in there!
Where's the doctor?
What's the matter?
Where's the doctor?
The doctor...
Oh, yeah...
I never got there.
This pea-brain grabbed me and stuck me in a wagon.
It would've broke your heart to see it.
- You never told me about no doctor.
- You never asked.
Is something wrong, Julia?
- Female trouble.
- Oh, the vapours.
- I'd better put you to bed, darling.
- I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell d'you pick him up for, Towfield?
- He was dressed like a Mexican.
- That's not illegal.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
I told him.
I told you but no, you wouldn't...
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not!
I can see it.
Them eyes ain't angry.
They're relieved.
And they ain't bloodshot.
- I wanted you back to work the mine.
- No.
You missed Old Man in the Moon.
Hell, I got my faults, I admit it, but...
Hell, I got my ways, too.
I missed you a little bit, too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border, I couldn't stop thinking that nobody's ever saved my life before.
I just couldn't leave you in your time of need... of me.
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out.
I think I'll take a poco siesta.
Oh, you don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
Rats.
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up, too.
I wanted to ride with the Younger Gang, they wouldn't have me.
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a Younger.
My feelings was hurt, but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good Lord Almighty, I found gold!
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I know it's around here somewhere.
I can feel it.
I don't see nothing.
It's here.
Believe me, it's here.
Goddamn!
Oh, goddamn!
Look at that, gold.
- It's all over everything.
- Moon, I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Honey, kiss me.
I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich!
You wait long enough, and pretty soon down it's gonna come right on you.
Like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know, I'm gonna get my initials put on my saddle in gold.
They like it that way down there in Mexico.
All we gotta do now is deposit this first bunch in the bank and then...
We?
What do you mean, we?
Just that, in all fairness, I played a part in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd've never struck it if it wasn't for me.
Correcto?
So?
So, where's my share of the stake?
You're right.
I'll give you ten percent.
You don't understand.
You see, sharing is giving to each other.
Fifty percent.
We'll talk about it later.
All right, all right.
Twenty-five percent and we can stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny depositing something in a bank, huh, Moon?
Yeah, it's a whole new experience for me.
We're sorry to have you and Miriam leave us.
Thank you.
What with the railroad and this black stuff springing up everywhere, a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
- I'll guard it with my life.
- You can do better than that, Whitey.
- Henry Lloyd Moon in the bank.
- Want one of these?
Sure.
Goddamn it.
I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the Younger Gang.
Darling, I think I'll buy me a little cantina south of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey.
I'm gonna be a patrón.
Tequila, cards, señoritas.
Hey, wait till the Dominguine sisters get a load of me!
Don't do that, you're acting foolish.
Maybe you oughta try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
Fifty percent?
You're gonna give me fifty percent?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're gonna put it that way, yeah.
I don't know how to say this, Henry.
But I think I got greedy and selfish living alone so long.
Well that's how you get.
Once you get started you don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
- Friends of yours?
- Used to be.
- What are they doing here?
- Good question.
Well...
Sorry to keep you waiting, but me and the missus was playing fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree.
- Did you?
- Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was gonna have you all out.
- You sure got your wish, didn't you?
- I damn sure did.
- Ain't you gonna ask us in, Henry?
- Why, sure, honey pie.
- Don't you know how to wipe your feet?
- Hey, old Coogan.
Wipe your feet off.
Hope you like taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me Big Abe.
Ol' Henry still snore in his sleep?
I want them out of here.
- Not as much as I do.
- Moon!
You want them to find out about the dust?
Well...
Anybody hungry?
Hungry?
Shit, I could eat a frozen dog.
Well, we'll go to the kitchen and see if we've got one already froze.
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
A feast fit for a king.
That's his speciality.
Them pork bellies make it tasty.
Did you know Henry used to cook for the Raiders?
He cooked for Quantrill's Raiders?
No, he never told me that.
I bet there's a lot he never told you.
Shit!
Goddamn, Abe.
There's ladies present.
Easy, you'll loosen my molar up.
Just play along a little while longer.
You go, I don't want to spoil your fun.
I ain't having a good time, I swear it.
Just trying to throw them off the track.
Wouldn't be me if I wasn't acting wild.
Forget about all this and go and have a good time.
Act foolish.
Shit.
This ain't no real marriage.
Come on.
Meet me tonight, huh?
I'll give you my old coyote call.
Remember?
Not now.
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
No.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow for the tooth fairy?
You won't get nothing for it.
Come on boys, let's help Big Abe find his goddamn molar.
Wait, I have a better idea.
Moon, let's go and buy Big Abe a whole goddamn set of gold teeth.
You'll ruin everything, acting like a fool.
I don't give a goddamn what anybody says, I'm a gentleman.
And I'm not gonna throw up in this house,
I'm going outside to throw up, 'cause I respect your house.
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house any old time.
Goddamn gold, that sonofabitch is keeping gold from us.
Got no money!
Sonofabitch!
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find Big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing?
You don't understand outlaws.
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and sing your head off.
- Hog liked my singing.
- That's why they call him Hog!
Damn, Hermine!
Quit that goddamn coyote calling, I'm here.
You're wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
No, she's just had a little too much bug juice.
Now I figure you ain't had much of anything in a long time.
How come you and the boys decided to stop by tonight?
I wanna make it real good for you, Henry.
Hermine, you ain't hearing my question.
God!
- What was it?
- I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling and all, but I told you, things have changed.
Crawl in, Henry, and see what I got.
You ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell.
We had some times together I'll never forget.
But Hermine, now I'm took.
Hold it.
That's enough.
- Don't shoot.
- Vamoose.
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why'd you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you won't believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of Hermine.
That wasn't all you wanted to get off of her.
All I wanted to know is if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about the gold than about me.
That ain't true.
I could've done what you think I done, but I didn't.
I don't believe you.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman!
Take her, but forget about the gold.
People can't afford business partners that cheat on them.
- We made an agreement.
- And I'm breaking it.
- You can't do that to me.
- I just did.
That tears it.
Gotta put the old double X to Henry Moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
Now, you want your gun back, Moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
- What gold?
- That gold right there, where is it?
You aren't quite as ignorant as you look.
Come on in.
- How much we got here?
- Enough.
Actually, I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure you was.
We're gonna hit the Longhorn bank.
There ain't nothing in that chickenfeed bank but sun-filled windows.
- And all the little lady's gold.
- Let's hit her in the morning.
- Not yet.
- You got a plan?
I'm gonna make that woman sorry she ever said, "I do. "
- He's hiding something.
- I don't think so.
- I know so.
- I knew he had a plan.
Me, too, but I don't know if we're in on it.
- Let's keep a watch on him.
- Come on, gang.
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I got nothing to say.
I keep my word.
Honey?
Honey, are you all right?
Goddamn.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Watch it.
That's it, all right.
- Can you stand there?
- Yes.
OK, there's a light.
- You all right?
- Well, I been better.
It's all right, nothing's gonna happen to you.
Here, hold this.
You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take a little Spanish pause.
Now...
Henry Lloyd?
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but if we're going to die, I want it to be as partners.
Fifty-fifty.
We was a good team.
Good?
Shit, we were the best.
- Honey pie.
- Moon I been thinking, since we're gonna go anyway, why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Tie me up.
We're alive!
- I been watching you, Henry.
- Figured.
Ain't you up a little early?
We don't hit the bank till ten.
There's been a little change in plans.
I gotta tell Big Abe.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
I'll never forget you, Hermine.
You was the first woman I didn't have to pay for.
Adios.
- You're a mite early, compadre.
- I wanna make a withdrawal.
Your wife will have to do that.
Us ordinance husbands aren't allowed to.
- Besides, we're closed.
- You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there.
Hurry up, buddy.
Cover that up.
I never thought you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, Whitey.
Grover, where's Julia?
Damn.
Rocks.
Damn, honey pie.
Reach, Moon.
Mr Moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
Guess he ain't heard the news.
- What news?
- Your wife sold up to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
- When?
- Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're going to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, Moon.
You're going to meet señor Peter.
- We know you got it.
- I ain't got nothing.
We don't believe you.
- Ain't got what?
Who's that?
- The ex-Moon Gang.
They picked the wrong hombres to mess with.
Watch it, Big Abe.
OK.
One, two, three!
- When did she leave?
- Why should I tell you?
About a half hour ago.
Now!
Moon, shoot back.
Yessum, this is mighty strange stuff.
Miriam dropped the lantern in some the other night, and the whole farm near went up in flames.
- Burned half the hair off my head.
- It stunk for two weeks.
The railroad has no use for it.
So I thought I'd take these samples East and maybe sell it.
What do you think, Miss Julia?
I'm sorry, Mr Standard.
I didn't hear what you said.
Drop that gun.
Hold it there!
Hold it there!
All right, stay calm.
All right.
Step down, Julia.
That sonofabitch can shoot.
He rode with Quantrill.
Come on.
You've run far enough.
Come on, now.
I'm losing my patience.
- You ain't taking my gold!
- Hey, they discovered gold!
No, they just had too much bug juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I meant to write, "Good luck Henry and Hermine"?
I was gonna explain everything...
Are you gonna rob this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle, or I'll blow everybody into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr Moon.
It's all right, Sheriff.
You go on ahead.
He's just trying to impress me.
Are you sure, Julia?
Well... you two try and get along, then.
We all had to.
My heart froze when I came home and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up with it.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways first, let's get used to being rich.
Oh, you Rio Grande!
Get in there.
V¡va Méx¡co!
V¡va Méx¡co!
This here's Mexican dirt.
You can't touch me.
Thought you'd get me?
You're a disgrace to the Confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down.
Get up!
This is Mexican territory.
He gets across the river and his horse faints on him!
This ain't fair, goddamn it.
This ain't fair.
This ain't fair.
Good Lord.
They're stringing up old Speed.
I have here a very fine animal once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey!
I still own that horse.
When we want to hear from you, amigo, we'll rattle your cage.
Ain't that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted.
But he got up, didn't he?
What?
What?
Towfield, I said keep these buzzards out.
Take it easy, Moon.
You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just want to see the man of the hour.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card, Moon.
I'm gonna miss you.
Your family's here.
Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe, Jimmy,
Gussy and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy.
He thought you were really my family.
So I figured...
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
- How ya doin', Henry?
- Well roll it out.
- Nothing like that, Henry.
- We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too good on your own, Henry.
You should've stuck with us.
We was going places, goddamn it.
What do you mean, "was"?
All you gotta do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get shot.
Yeah, but that's without my plan.
Cut that out.
Big Abe, they're gonna send me to the bone orchard.
If you got anything you want to give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your goodbyes, boys.
- Nice knowing you.
- Yeah, Coogan, sure.
It just ain't right.
Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
The law's gotta be changed, Henry.
Go on outside.
So long, Moon.
Adios.
Well, honey, at least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had.
Except maybe that circus fella.
- Why does that always upset you?
- Why bring that up now, Hermine?
- Shit!
- Oh, Henry.
Don't worry, Moon.
I'm gonna take care of this girl like she's my very own.
- Come on, honey.
- Oh, Henry.
Mr Moon?
It's about that time.
- What about my last meal?
- You're smoking it.
Hands behind your back, Mr Moon.
He ain't for you.
I wouldn't take you to a dog fight if you was the defending champ.
You oughtn't to have done that, Mr Moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
- You tell him about the ordinance?
- No.
Why not?
People I don't like, I don't tell nothing.
- Goddamn it, Towfield.
- What ordinance?
- What ordinance, Sheriff Pile?
- Kyle.
We got this ordinance here, passed after the Civil War, because a lot of our boys didn't come home and the women was chewing up the grass.
- I feel sorry for the grass.
- I feel sorry for the women.
This ordinance says any man, short of a murderer, can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female, providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, as I recall.
Sweet Jesus H Christ Almighty!
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
There's a couple of things about me that I'd like you to consider.
- I don't need your insults.
- I agree completely.
But you've gotta take into consideration that a man can get a little irritated and act like the dickens when he's about to die.
- Buzzards, huh?
- Well, buzzards can fly.
And they keep the desert clean.
I cook.
I cook like a sonofabitch.
I mean like the dickens.
- Hello, son.
- Go to hell.
I understand.
Henry Lloyd Moon, you've been found guilty of horse thievery and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this:
I wanna tell you good people of Longhorn, especially you lovely ladies, that the old saying, "You can't judge a book by its cover", it's true.
Some books are all scruffed up on the outside, but when you turn around and look inside, why, the words is just wonderful.
Is that it, Moon?
Isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.
"He restoreth my soul. "
That's not right.
"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.
"Yea, though I walk through the valley... "
I'm a veteran of the great Civil War.
The only reason why I turned to crime was there wasn't no jobs.
Not one single job for a man who risked his life for his country.
In the Confederacy!
This one's dumb, he'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. "
Bullshit!
Ready to go.
Stop!
I'll take him.
Florence!
Now...
Don't you think that you're a mite too elderly to take on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran.
He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this son-bitchin' blindfold off me and let me see my bride.
Where is she?
Florence!
Florence!
Mrs Henry Moon.
Let me look at you.
- Stand back, folks.
- Florence!
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
- I made her dizzy.
- Down she go, up you go.
Is she dead?
Then I'll take him.
Julia, what are you saying?
He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you're hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink.
You want him?
The law says I can claim him, right?
I asked you out ten times.
What did I get?
A flap of your umbrella.
Shit!
All right.
OK, Julia.
Mr Moon, what do you say?
I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off, but hell, fine by me.
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't taking Frank Towfield's business tonight.
Somebody's taking his business, or we ain't got no business.
Now, Mr Moon: no drinking, no gambling, no wife-beating, no alley-cattin' and what have you.
You've got to mind her.
If you try running, there'll be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you.
Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
Adios!
See, I told you he had a plan.
You can dance in the air, you sonofabitch.
Stealing my girl.
Miss, in case you want to know who you're dealing with I used to ride with Quantrill's Raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well, look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
Of course, a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find, standing there with a rope around your neck.
Yeah.
You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
Sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, Rover.
That's Grover.
This is where I live.
Well, Julia.
It ain't much, but it's a start.
Guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
Well... it looks like the opera house.
Please take your clothes off, Mr Moon.
Don't sit there.
Here, put these on.
These is work clothes.
That's right.
But I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine?
In Texas?
It's gonna be.
Looks like mice bit into it.
First you'll begin crevassing, then cross-cut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Then you insert the drill.
Like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blister easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Mr Moon...
Pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck, so let's not waste any more time.
I'll do all I can do, but that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How'd you come into this place?
It was my father's.
Did he believe in this gold mine?
He believed, but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
How's about a little dessert?
I said, how's about a little dessert?
- I heard you the first time.
- You didn't answer me the first time.
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time you had a man?
I hope you don't mind confined spaces, tomorrow we start tunnelling.
Goddamn, I should've known.
You can always tell a virgin because the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
I got this theory on virgins, that they always look peaked and grouchy because they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back, but in my time I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Listen to me.
Don't let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is...
I'll be outside in the barn if you feel like getting acquainted, or talking about tunnelling.
And remember, nature is the great provider.
Goddamn.
Well, good morning, Spot.
Could use some bacon...
Morning, miss.
What's for breakfast?
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me, I know how to pace myself.
If I want to I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long.
Pace myself.
Where are you going?
I wanna take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacing yourself.
You just go on trimming your wicks.
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long.
All day long.
Hey, lady!
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
A lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the city of motherly love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
- To Philadelphia?
- Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
Pace suits me better.
Slow days and fast nights.
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw lights and felt we weren't intruding.
Oh, Laurette, you're never intruding.
You all remember my husband, Henry.
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
- I'll get us some tea.
- Shall I help?
We'll help.
Don't be long now.
We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to.
Especially now.
What Laurette is trying to say is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Oh.
Since you've never been married before, we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, Laurette.
You know, I rode with Quantrill.
Finest revolver gang in history, till he died.
Quantrill died?
Last year.
That Shorty, he don't even ask.
He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night he got all painted up like an Indian.
And did he go on the warpath!
Say, want to have yourself a really wild time?
Why not dress up like an Indian?
That sounds like it oughta be Julia's cup of tea.
I guess I'll go on out and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
But, if it should become one,
I have found that the best thing to do is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
How are we doing, ladies?
Bye.
- Thank you for the lovely gift.
- Let's do it again real soon.
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well you know what they say:
"Lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog. "
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know, I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air.
Why, it's poetry.
Think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon, all over America, people's gonna be picking up chairs and setting them down.
It's gonna be all your doing.
Julia what do you say we try canning some of them apricots?
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox
"and looking for two, hoping for the help of the Lord.
"Why not get rid of all the oxen
"and count on the Maker all the way?"
Very good.
- I look forward to hearing it on Sunday.
- Thank you.
Morning, ladies!
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night.
Julia!
What the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke?
No.
You don't understand.
A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Miss Tate.
Please step into the office.
It's Mrs Moon.
Excuse me.
Miss Tate...
- Why, you...
- Henry.
I believe this is between Mr Polty and myself.
Hey, Moon!
It looks like the honeymoon is over.
What's the matter, Moon?
You look like a dog without a bone.
- Hey, Hector.
- Si.
Why don't you go to the Mexican side of town, see what the beans is jumping on?
- Beans?
- Beans.
You know, Polty's just another word for chicken.
Good one, Towfield.
- Who thought it up for you?
- Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
'Cause I'm in a good mood.
Well, how's about a little snort?
Hey, Peachy.
Bottle of mash and two glasses, Norvell.
- Not for him.
- What do you mean?
- Sheriff's orders.
- Sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks!
You know, I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for?
Hell, if you hadn't jerked me back across the border to the just desserts, so to speak, why I'd never have been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why you sorta introduced us.
Yeah, Towfield... things is good.
You heard about matches made in heaven, didn't you?
- Well, I'm in one of 'em.
- Goddamn it, Moon!
You stole my girl.
Take it easy, Towfield.
You're wrinkling my good luck bandanna.
How's this?
You give me the bottle and I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
She puts chairs up on the wall so people can't sit on them.
What?
I can't go into it, Towfield, it's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Duck out back for a snort.
Listen, amigo, don't ever call me a bean again.
What the hell was that?
Bye, Moon.
This is as hard for me as it is for you.
A year ago last Christmas Eve,
I had to move 150 Comanche souls off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey?
You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
- What?
- This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it does me.
The railroad's taking over my land under eminent domain.
Eminent domain.
Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature to take away some poor folks' land?
- I won't dignify that with an answer.
- I ain't asking for no dignification.
But I do find it interesting that you prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, Moon.
I'm sorry, Julia, but unless I am advised otherwise,
I'll be out to survey.
You know Polty's just another way of saying chicken.
Whoa, William.
They may be bold maids till they die
Oh, yes.
Mother says I mustn't Oh, George, please George, not just yet
Oh, yes.
Swim, swim.
Be naked.
Oh, yes.
Oh, I love you.
Who's there?
What are you doing?
Oh, Julia.
I was just out here surveying.
You liar!
You were spying on me.
Me?
I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia.
I swear on my honour.
I didn't see a thing.
It's not what you think.
- You old...
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.
- Are you bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying.
There's my equipment.
My tripod, my maps...
Caught you, didn't I?
I swear, no.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then, apologise.
- I apologise.
- All right.
Now eminent domain your ass outta here!
Ooh, nasty!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know.
Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
- That's all you like to do.
- No.
That ain't all I like to do.
No, Moon.
Ooh, nasty!
Damn.
- It's northern.
- Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Outlaws don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
What am I doing?
I guess I was dreaming about tunnelling or something.
Out!
You got me drunk, I don't remember a thing.
- I didn't get you drunk.
- I will not have such talk here.
You tricked me!
I didn't trick you.
Get your clothes and get up, there's work to do.
Oh, I get it.
You're so afraid you're gonna like that, that you'll forget the gold and Philadelphia.
Get your clothes and get out of here.
Sonofabitch!
I was right.
All these years!
Them painted ladies knows how to appreciate a man.
They don't got unnatural questions. "How did it feel?"
Dammit.
I feel sorry for the poor sonofabitch that winds up with you.
Nice being married to you!
You haven't got a plug nickel.
You haven't even got a gun.
You won't get 20 miles before a posse'll get you and string you up.
I only slept with you so you'd keep on working.
I hope they hang you.
Not the curtain.
You wouldn't dare.
Well I hadn't thought of it, but now you mention it, up in San Francisco I seen some Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilisation.
They understand things about pleasure that I've never even thought of.
One thing's for sure: we ain't had a boring marriage.
Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
- But 15 days?
That's not fair.
- Tell it to the railroad.
- We've been here since '43.
- Them's the breaks.
Damn worthless black goo.
I was just going into town to buy an animal.
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Me and the little woman haven't been getting along.
Don't go in there!
Where's the doctor?
What's the matter?
Where's the doctor?
The doctor...
Oh, yeah...
I never got there.
This pea-brain grabbed me and stuck me in a wagon.
It would've broke your heart to see it.
- You never told me about no doctor.
- You never asked.
Is something wrong, Julia?
- Female trouble.
- Oh, the vapours.
- I'd better put you to bed, darling.
- I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell d'you pick him up for, Towfield?
- He was dressed like a Mexican.
- That's not illegal.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
I told him.
I told you but no, you wouldn't...
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not!
I can see it.
Them eyes ain't angry.
They're relieved.
And they ain't bloodshot.
- I wanted you back to work the mine.
- No.
You missed Old Man in the Moon.
Hell, I got my faults, I admit it, but...
Hell, I got my ways, too.
I missed you a little bit, too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border, I couldn't stop thinking that nobody's ever saved my life before.
I just couldn't leave you in your time of need... of me.
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out.
I think I'll take a poco siesta.
Oh, you don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
Rats.
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up, too.
I wanted to ride with the Younger Gang, they wouldn't have me.
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a Younger.
My feelings was hurt, but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good Lord Almighty, I found gold!
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I know it's around here somewhere.
I can feel it.
I don't see nothing.
It's here.
Believe me, it's here.
Goddamn!
Oh, goddamn!
Look at that, gold.
- It's all over everything.
- Moon, I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Honey, kiss me.
I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich!
You wait long enough, and pretty soon down it's gonna come right on you.
Like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know, I'm gonna get my initials put on my saddle in gold.
They like it that way down there in Mexico.
All we gotta do now is deposit this first bunch in the bank and then...
We?
What do you mean, we?
Just that, in all fairness, I played a part in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd've never struck it if it wasn't for me.
Correcto?
So?
So, where's my share of the stake?
You're right.
I'll give you ten percent.
You don't understand.
You see, sharing is giving to each other.
Fifty percent.
We'll talk about it later.
All right, all right.
Twenty-five percent and we can stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny depositing something in a bank, huh, Moon?
Yeah, it's a whole new experience for me.
We're sorry to have you and Miriam leave us.
Thank you.
What with the railroad and this black stuff springing up everywhere, a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
- I'll guard it with my life.
- You can do better than that, Whitey.
- Henry Lloyd Moon in the bank.
- Want one of these?
Sure.
Goddamn it.
I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the Younger Gang.
Darling, I think I'll buy me a little cantina south of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey.
I'm gonna be a patrón.
Tequila, cards, señoritas.
Hey, wait till the Dominguine sisters get a load of me!
Don't do that, you're acting foolish.
Maybe you oughta try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
Fifty percent?
You're gonna give me fifty percent?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're gonna put it that way, yeah.
I don't know how to say this, Henry.
But I think I got greedy and selfish living alone so long.
Well that's how you get.
Once you get started you don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
- Friends of yours?
- Used to be.
- What are they doing here?
- Good question.
Well...
Sorry to keep you waiting, but me and the missus was playing fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree.
- Did you?
- Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was gonna have you all out.
- You sure got your wish, didn't you?
- I damn sure did.
- Ain't you gonna ask us in, Henry?
- Why, sure, honey pie.
- Don't you know how to wipe your feet?
- Hey, old Coogan.
Wipe your feet off.
Hope you like taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me Big Abe.
Ol' Henry still snore in his sleep?
I want them out of here.
- Not as much as I do.
- Moon!
You want them to find out about the dust?
Well...
Anybody hungry?
Hungry?
Shit, I could eat a frozen dog.
Well, we'll go to the kitchen and see if we've got one already froze.
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
A feast fit for a king.
That's his speciality.
Them pork bellies make it tasty.
Did you know Henry used to cook for the Raiders?
He cooked for Quantrill's Raiders?
No, he never told me that.
I bet there's a lot he never told you.
Shit!
Goddamn, Abe.
There's ladies present.
Easy, you'll loosen my molar up.
Just play along a little while longer.
You go, I don't want to spoil your fun.
I ain't having a good time, I swear it.
Just trying to throw them off the track.
Wouldn't be me if I wasn't acting wild.
Forget about all this and go and have a good time.
Act foolish.
Shit.
This ain't no real marriage.
Come on.
Meet me tonight, huh?
I'll give you my old coyote call.
Remember?
Not now.
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
No.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow for the tooth fairy?
You won't get nothing for it.
Come on boys, let's help Big Abe find his goddamn molar.
Wait, I have a better idea.
Moon, let's go and buy Big Abe a whole goddamn set of gold teeth.
You'll ruin everything, acting like a fool.
I don't give a goddamn what anybody says, I'm a gentleman.
And I'm not gonna throw up in this house,
I'm going outside to throw up, 'cause I respect your house.
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house any old time.
Goddamn gold, that sonofabitch is keeping gold from us.
Got no money!
Sonofabitch!
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find Big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing?
You don't understand outlaws.
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and sing your head off.
- Hog liked my singing.
- That's why they call him Hog!
Damn, Hermine!
Quit that goddamn coyote calling, I'm here.
You're wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
No, she's just had a little too much bug juice.
Now I figure you ain't had much of anything in a long time.
How come you and the boys decided to stop by tonight?
I wanna make it real good for you, Henry.
Hermine, you ain't hearing my question.
God!
- What was it?
- I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling and all, but I told you, things have changed.
Crawl in, Henry, and see what I got.
You ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell.
We had some times together I'll never forget.
But Hermine, now I'm took.
Hold it.
That's enough.
- Don't shoot.
- Vamoose.
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why'd you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you won't believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of Hermine.
That wasn't all you wanted to get off of her.
All I wanted to know is if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about the gold than about me.
That ain't true.
I could've done what you think I done, but I didn't.
I don't believe you.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman!
Take her, but forget about the gold.
People can't afford business partners that cheat on them.
- We made an agreement.
- And I'm breaking it.
- You can't do that to me.
- I just did.
That tears it.
Gotta put the old double X to Henry Moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
Now, you want your gun back, Moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
- What gold?
- That gold right there, where is it?
You aren't quite as ignorant as you look.
Come on in.
- How much we got here?
- Enough.
Actually, I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure you was.
We're gonna hit the Longhorn bank.
There ain't nothing in that chickenfeed bank but sun-filled windows.
- And all the little lady's gold.
- Let's hit her in the morning.
- Not yet.
- You got a plan?
I'm gonna make that woman sorry she ever said, "I do. "
- He's hiding something.
- I don't think so.
- I know so.
- I knew he had a plan.
Me, too, but I don't know if we're in on it.
- Let's keep a watch on him.
- Come on, gang.
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I got nothing to say.
I keep my word.
Honey?
Honey, are you all right?
Goddamn.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Watch it.
That's it, all right.
- Can you stand there?
- Yes.
OK, there's a light.
- You all right?
- Well, I been better.
It's all right, nothing's gonna happen to you.
Here, hold this.
You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take a little Spanish pause.
Now...
Henry Lloyd?
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but if we're going to die, I want it to be as partners.
Fifty-fifty.
We was a good team.
Good?
Shit, we were the best.
- Honey pie.
- Moon I been thinking, since we're gonna go anyway, why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Tie me up.
We're alive!
- I been watching you, Henry.
- Figured.
Ain't you up a little early?
We don't hit the bank till ten.
There's been a little change in plans.
I gotta tell Big Abe.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
I'll never forget you, Hermine.
You was the first woman I didn't have to pay for.
Adios.
- You're a mite early, compadre.
- I wanna make a withdrawal.
Your wife will have to do that.
Us ordinance husbands aren't allowed to.
- Besides, we're closed.
- You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there.
Hurry up, buddy.
Cover that up.
I never thought you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, Whitey.
Grover, where's Julia?
Damn.
Rocks.
Damn, honey pie.
Reach, Moon.
Mr Moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
Guess he ain't heard the news.
- What news?
- Your wife sold up to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
- When?
- Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're going to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, Moon.
You're going to meet señor Peter.
- We know you got it.
- I ain't got nothing.
We don't believe you.
- Ain't got what?
Who's that?
- The ex-Moon Gang.
They picked the wrong hombres to mess with.
Watch it, Big Abe.
OK.
One, two, three!
- When did she leave?
- Why should I tell you?
About a half hour ago.
Now!
Moon, shoot back.
Yessum, this is mighty strange stuff.
Miriam dropped the lantern in some the other night, and the whole farm near went up in flames.
- Burned half the hair off my head.
- It stunk for two weeks.
The railroad has no use for it.
So I thought I'd take these samples East and maybe sell it.
What do you think, Miss Julia?
I'm sorry, Mr Standard.
I didn't hear what you said.
Drop that gun.
Hold it there!
Hold it there!
All right, stay calm.
All right.
Step down, Julia.
That sonofabitch can shoot.
He rode with Quantrill.
Come on.
You've run far enough.
Come on, now.
I'm losing my patience.
- You ain't taking my gold!
- Hey, they discovered gold!
No, they just had too much bug juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I meant to write, "Good luck Henry and Hermine"?
I was gonna explain everything...
Are you gonna rob this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle, or I'll blow everybody into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr Moon.
It's all right, Sheriff.
You go on ahead.
He's just trying to impress me.
Are you sure, Julia?
Well... you two try and get along, then.
We all had to.
My heart froze when I came home and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up with it.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways first, let's get used to being rich.
We're leaving our star system.
They removed the laser generator.
Makes sense.
Get rid of the laser generators and... you're unarmed!
You haven't helped the Colonies, you've just kept the enforcers in power!
We must assume a Cylon has captured or killed Lieutenant Starbuck.
Cylons!
I told you, he's a Cylon spy!
If I am, I'm in big trouble.
'There are those who believe 'that life here 'began out there, 'far across the universe, 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans.
'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens.'
We are nearly through the asteroid dust, Commander.
I'm as nervous as a...
young cadet on his first orbit.
I'm not nervous. I don't even know what to be nervous about.
We're leaving our star system.
When we get through this asteroid dust, there'll be a new galaxy.
One no human in this fleet has seen before.
- Commander.
- Yes.
- (Muffit barks)
- Hush up. lt's just a bunch of old stars.
Perhaps Boxey should take the helm.
He has a singular perspective.
- Can I?
- No, you cannot.
You are centons into your sleep period.
- Oh.
Commander?
- Keep me out of this, young man.
I may be the commander but he's your father.
- Thank you.
- (Muffit barks)
Next time I'll act excited and maybe we could stay up.
Come on, Muffit.
- Was I ever like that?
- Worse.
Initial readings are negative on any signs of life in the first quadrant, sir.
When the fleet has cleared the asteroid dust, concentrate sensors forward
- to increase our range.
- Yes, sir.
- Who's our volunteer?
- Starbuck.
- Starbuck?
- Starbuck?
Volunteer?
I don't think it was his sense of duty.
Father's idea to reopen the dining lounge on the Rising Star was brilliant.
Only the waiting list is a yahren long.
The first pilot to fly the new recon viper goes to the head of the list.
Let's not deprecate Starbuck.
It could be a dangerous mission.
- No, sir.
- What's Starbuck's status?
He's due on the Rising Star at any moment.
I hope we don't have to move him to red before he eats.
Starbuck did ask me to dinner tonight but...
Well, I do have this duty.
I guess he'll have to eat alone.
Well, er...perhaps this once we can make an exception, hm?
You go ahead and join him.
I'll handle this with Colonel Tigh.
I've sailed the Rising Star hundreds of times.
This reminds me of the old days - before the war.
Anyhow, look, it may be a while before I get another chance to come here for dinner.
Big mission coming up.
Do you have a private dining room?
Lieutenant, private rooms are reserved 60 and 70 centares in advance.
Well, one can always make arrangements for a warrior on his last night.
I don't like the way he said that.
- What's this about a mission?
- lt's just a routine recon flight but don't tell him that.
Will this do, Lieutenant?
Perfect.
And a bottle of your finest Ambrosa.
Ambrosa's as rare as tylinium.
I'll see what I can do, sir.
Starbuck...
This is all so beautiful.
Most men don't treat a med technician like this.
I think of you only as a woman.
A very rare and beautiful woman.
(Giggling)
I'll try to live up to that image.
Be back in a centon.
Commander, the long-range scanner indicates possible life forms.
Quadrant Alpha 6.
- Request probe concentration.
- Concentration's approved.
- Cylons?
- lmpossible to tell.
- Prepare Recon Viper 1 .
- Yes, sir.
Probe indicates definite life signs.
Er...
Athena!
I managed to get off work after all.
I just didn't want you to be alone on your last night before...
- You are alone, aren't you?
- Oh, er... well, not any longer.
Sir?
Yes?
Ah.
Listen, there...
You don't have a room with a better view?
There's a sanitation ship off our beam.
Not exactly appetizing scenery.
- A sanitation ship?
Where?
- lt must have drifted back.
I think there's a first orbit cadet at the controls.
Get me another room.
Yes, sir, I quite understand.
Good.
- Follow me.
- Er...
Athena?
Asteroid concentration, binary star system.
Alpha 6, mark 775.
That's within a hectare of our course.
Yes. I hope Lieutenant Starbuck has had time to finish his dinner.
Starbuck, these mushies are just heavenly.
Oh, er..
No, thanks.
Too bad we can't have any fresh protein with them.
I'll see what I can do.
- Wait.
Just buzz the waiter.
- Oh, no. lt's too slow.
I'll be back in a flash.
What happened?
They're all out of mushies. I'm sorry.
I don't mind.
The protein's just fine.
This stuff's only a yahren old.
Well, I think it has the right effect.
So I see.
(PA) 'Lieutenant Starbuck, report to Battlestar Galactica, flight deck blue.
'Lieutenant Starbuck, report to Battlestar Galactica, flight deck blue, priority red.'
- Oh, Starbuck.
- Duty calls, love.
Here.
Oh!
- Duty calls, love.
- l'm going with you.
No.
No you're not.
This dinner is costing every cubit I've got.
One of us is going to enjoy it.
Don't move. I want to remember you just as you are.
Beautiful against the stars.
Sir.
Well...no need for cubits where l'm going.
Thank you, sir.
And may I say I admire the lieutenant's daring.
Well, it's just another mission.
No, sir. I'm referring to the two young ladies.
Very pre-war.
Why!
Why, that...!
Oh, well, my, my, my.
Don't we look just precious?
Commander's orders. in case I have to land.
Don't want everyone to know I'm a Colonial warrior.
Starbuck, you never look like a warrior.
Enjoy your dinner?
Well, let's just say I'm looking forward to a few centons in space - alone.
Just me, a fast ship and a fair galaxy.
A fast ship you have.
They've doubled range and speed and installed a voice-activated computer that can outfly the Cylons.
Hot pilot doesn't need all that electronic felgercarb.
Switch on your short-range marker beacon so we can track you.
No other transmissions unless essential, then only in scrambled code.
We don't want the Cylons tracing you back to us.
And, er, Starbuck...
if the Cylons should spot you... I know. I know, it's a one-way voyage.
Can't have them tracking me back to the fleet.
- Twice as fast?
- You'll love her.
They put a second pulse generator on all engines.
- lt doesn't look bigger.
- She's not.
You can't add weight without getting rid of something.
- They removed the laser generators.
- Oh.
Transferring launch control to Recon Viper 1 .
Launch when ready.
Makes sense.
Get rid of the laser generators and... you're unarmed!
Wish we were with him.
Yeah, so do I.
Short-range beacon on and functioning.
Recon Viper 1 indicating light speed and accelerating.
OK, baby, let's see what you can do.
Whoo!
Fantastic.
Incredible.
I'd like to see a computer do that.
(Female-voiced computer) 'You asked for it.'
Whoa!
- Computer, back to normal track.
- 'Your wish is my command, honey.'
- The name's Starbuck.
- 'Don't be a bore.
My name's CORA.
'Short for Computer Oral Response Activated.
'l'm programmed to respond instantly to all your needs.
'l'm also to keep you amused over the duration of our prolonged voyage.
'We're on a Delta vector for quadrant Alpha 6.
'l've activated my sensors and am probing the asteroid area 'where life forms were reported by Galactica's rather limited scanner.'
- Do I detect jealousy?
- 'Quiet please, I'm scanning.'
Excuse me.
'l have two unidentified sub-light vehicles bearing Omega 1 , Alpha 6.
'Shall we investigate?
'
What do we do if they're Cylons, wave?
'We have enough speed to outrun anything in the universe.
Hang on.
'Slowing to sub-light speed.
Let's not barge in until we know what they are.'
- Who they are.
- 'Excuse me.
'l'm putting them on the screen.
Visual contact in .15 centons.'
- They're ancient.
- 'Sixth millennium fighter craft.
'They're probably not Cylon.
Feel better, honey?
'
No, I don't like to see any unarmed craft being chased by a fighter.
Not this time, Robber.
'May I suggest a high-speed flyby 'kicking in our second booster within 50 metrons?
'Our backwash should knock him silly 'and scare the pogees out of him.'
- Release controls.
- (Sighing) 'Released.'
Croad here.
Lost contact.
Returning to Proteus.
(CORA) 'You were 52 metrons away when you used your booster.'
- lt worked, didn't it?
- 'Rather sloppily.'
- Listen...
- 'Fighter is disengaging 'and turning for asteroid .7 1 hectares distant.
'Shuttlecraft has been damaged and is landing on asteroid ahead.
- 'What shall we do?
'
- Follow the shuttle.
'May I land us, or do I have to go through a bouncer?
'
Just give me the vector.
'Vector's displayed.
'Please, try not to jar my chips.
'Switching all systems except marker beacon to standby mode.'
Yo!
You all right?
Drop it.
I'm sorry. I thought you were the pirate that was chasing me.
They're probably from the Frodo system.
Nasty bunch.
I don't know why I crossed this asteroid belt.
- l said drop it.
- l don't blame you for being cautious.
I'm a shuttle driver with agro parts for the farmers on Crodan.
Crodan?
What's that?
What settlement?
It's a small, primitive settlement that's never seen a beauty like the one you're flying.
- You're not from this system?
- l'll ask the questions.
I know. I just like to know where l stand.
Are you a pirate?
You want to check my cargo?
Go on.
- lt's not worth much.
- Think I will.
Uh-uh-uh!
- (Glass clinks)
- Agro parts for some farmer on Crodan?
Aye, and that, too.
This is Ambrosa.
It must be more than 50 yahren old.
500 to be exact.
Five...?
That's impossible.
There hasn't been any of this around the star system since the war.
- What star system?
- Where'd you get this?
It can't be real.
Are you a bootlegger?
Try it.
I will.
Mmm.
By all that's holy.
I got a lot more.
If you'd keep your mouth shut, I'd be glad to share my find with you.
This is worth a fortune.
How much is there?
A lot more than you or I could haul out of here.
But your ship doesn't look like it was made for cargo. it looks like...
Now, wait a minute.
You're not the pirate?
You're not going to kill me?
Well, I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm a little leery of pirates myself.
I don't blame you.
- How many of those guys are there?
- This is a pretty rough sector.
Dozens of asteroids where they can hide and attack an unsuspecting ship.
You wouldn't be an advance scout for some sort of convoy, would you?
No, no, no.
This'd be a very bad place to bring an unarmed ship.
That it would.
Tell me, what kind of range do you figure those pirates have?
- l don't really know...
- (Starbuck gasps) I'm sorry, lad, but that beauty you're flying is the answer to all my dreams.
Commander, short-range beacon indicates
Recon Viper 1 climbing back into orbit.
Maintain tracking.
He may be onto something.
'Finally decided to turn me back on?
- 'Shall I scan for that fighter?
'
- Negative.
'ldentify.'
- Are you capable of flying this ship?
- 'Affirmative.
- 'identify.'
- All right, then, control is yours.
Assume course to asteroid mass 1 .0775, bearing Delta 7.
'Computed.
Where's Starbuck?
'
Prepare to transmit intergalactic transmitter reach.
'Displayed.
What happened to Starbuck?
'
Stand by to transmit.
Commander!
Long-range transmissions being sent by Recon Viper 1 .
- Are you sure it's long-range?
- Narrow beam.
- lt's a code but not scrambled.
- What's that fool doing?
- An inoperative short-post transmitter?
- lt's possible, Father.
But why an unknown code and unscrambled?
I suggest we check the Cylon codes, sir.
Do it.
We are picking up a transmission in a strange code.
- Launch fighters to investigate.
- By your command.
(Sighs) No response to known Cylon code patterns.
Commander, we must assume a Cylon has captured or killed Lieutenant Starbuck and now has command of Recon Viper 1 .
That transmission is being beamed at our old home galaxy.
If it's not a message to the Cylons, it's a beacon directing them here.
That transmission must be stopped.
Alert my son.
We are to destroy Recon Viper 1 .
Can't we try to make communication first?
If the recon viper starts the pulse generators, we'll be eating ion vapours.
- Captain, Starbuck...
- Probably dead, Boomer.
Transferring launch control to viper fighters.
Launch when ready.
(Groaning)
Oh, no.
It's like trying to fly a museum.
- (Engine fails)
- CORA, where are you when I need you?
- Come on, baby, ignite.
- (Engine starts)
Orbit.
Goodbye, Robber.
I'm not Robber.
You're making a mistake.
'l'm not Robber.'
All right.
Now, you follow me and don't even think about running.
Name's Starbuck, privateer, Cyranus Galaxy.
A little misunderstanding.
Easy, easy, easy.
I just want to offer you guys a little drink.
Look, you've got me mixed up with another guy.
He took my ship and left me with his worthless load of agro parts.
Maybe we can make a deal.
Long-range transmissions have stopped.
Still picking up the short-range beacon.
It's coinciding with that asteroid, bearing Omega 7-5 relative.
Let's hope he stays there till we get there.
And then?
We carry out our mission.
(Groaning)
(Distant hum of conversation)
Twice in one day. lt just isn't fair.
What's happening?
What is this place?
Well, now.
What have we here?
What's your name, lad?
- Starbuck.
- Starbuck?
Starbuck, you say, huh?
Hm, that's strange.
Never heard of that one before.
To our new mate, Starbuck.
(All) Starbuck!
Starbuck!
Ambrosa.
And over 100 yahrens old.
Yes, yes, but they don't give us the good stuff.
- Where am I?
- Proteus Prison.
Oh, I'm Assault 9.
That's Forger 7 round the corner there.
Embezzler 10 down the block there and Adulteress 58, I see you've already met.
- (Man) Hand it over.
- And our, our children, of course.
What kind of offence is starbucking?
Sounds interesting.
- lt's not an offence. lt's a name.
- They're one and the same, boy.
I wonder if our original sinners were as ignorant as this one.
- Original sinners?
- (Assault 9) Yes, our ancestors.
The ones that were first sentenced here.
You're here for crimes committed by your ancestors?
At least we're not an original sinner like you.
Come on, now.
What is starbucking?
You can tell us.
It's a name. I'm just a privateer from another galaxy.
Tell me, lad, any news about the war?
- The war?
- Yes.
Between the Colonies and the Alliance.
You know, we supply Ambrosa for the Colonial warriors.
- You what?
- We may be prisoners but we're as patriotic as any Colonist.
(Forger 7) We used to supply munitions and Ambrosa for the war effort.
When the munitions ran out, we kept on making the only thing we could -
Ambrosa.
And we've been making it for 700 yahrens.
- Death to the Cylons!
- (All) Death to the Cylons!
Death to the Cylons!
You sent for me?
Yes.
Station 8, please cover long scan.
Alpha mode for a centon.
Thank you.
Come here.
Starbuck is on a long-range patrol.
We are receiving intermittent transmissions in a code we can't decipher from his recon viper.
Therefore, we can only assume that he is no longer in command.
He may be lost... or dead.
In any case, we sent out a patrol to destroy his ship.
And even if he's still alive, without a ship...he can't get back.
I just thought you should know.
- (Athena) Taking back the scanner.
- Athena, thank you.
Father, long-range transmissions from Recon Viper 1 resuming.
Same frequency and direction.
- Apollo's patrol status?
- They'll reach their site soon.
We've tried every known military code.
We can't break it.
- That's an Aerian merchant code.
- What?
My father was a merchant.
I used to transmit for him.
That looks like an Aerian merchant code.
A merchant code.
From the strength of that signal, we're close.
Activating attack computer.
Activating attack computer.
It's a request for the coordinates to Aeries!
Countermand the destruct orders.
(Rigel) 'Blue Squadron patrol, disengage your attack.'
- The Galactica's countermanding.
- Pulling up.
Boomer, he's landing.
Let's investigate.
It must be a human who doesn't know that Aeries is in Cylon hands.
- Have Apollo investigate with caution.
- Yes, sir.
Tell him to stop that transmission.
Thank you for your help.
Well, you just saved some Aeries' life and maybe Starbuck's.
Let's hope so.
Of course, it won't change anything when he gets back.
I wouldn't want it any other way.
Looks deserted.
Only one way to find out.
He's been stripping the ship, making room for cargo.
- We're not going to find anything here.
- Uh-uh, my turn.
You've been around Starbuck too long.
Forgot how to take orders.
Thanks.
- That sure isn't Starbuck.
- Don't bet on it.
Ready?
Go!
- There he goes.
- Don't shoot, he's human.
(Crash)
(Woman) No!
Apollo!
There's a woman and child here!
Don't hurt them.
Do what you want with me but don't hurt my wife and child.
I'm begging you.
My father taught me the merchant code like his father taught him.
Our original sinner was an Aerian robber.
These enforcers, their ancestors were the original guards?
In a strange way, those swine are as trapped as we are.
Why didn't you make for Aeries when you escaped from prison?
- l didn't have a capable ship.
- Till you stole Starbuck's viper.
He did it for Tania, so he did.
We couldn't stand seeing her raised in that prison.
I think I would have done the same.
Scanners indicate three Cylon fighters emerging from the asteroid dust cloud.
Omega, transfer long-range scanners to my console, please.
- Transferring.
- They're not following us.
They're heading for the asteroid where Recon Viper 1 landed.
And Apollo's patrol.
They must be scanning a narrow beam or they'd have picked us up.
(Rapid beeping)
Colonel... bring the fleet to flank speed...
and set a new course.
Put as much space as possible between ourselves and those fighters.
Commander, Apollo's patrol won't know where to find us.
Set the course, please.
Yes, sir.
Well.
Well, now, we have visitors.
What are you doing up at this time of night?
I don't sleep too good when my father isn't on board.
When is he coming back?
Well...you know your father's away on a very, very important mission.
It may be a little while yet.
But I miss him and so does Muffit.
Don't you, Muffit?
- (Barking)
- Yes, I'm sure you do miss him.
Do you miss him?
Yes, very much.
You know, when your father was as old as you are now... sometimes, when he couldn't sleep, he'd come into my room and climb into bed with me, and I'd tell him stories.
- Would you like me to tell you a story?
- Yeah.
- Tell me a story about Earth.
- Oh, about Earth.
All right.
Now, Earth... is a beautiful, blue-white planet...
Take your bottle, Bootlegger.
The name's Starbuck.
From now on your name is Bootlegger 137.
Put that on.
You'd better learn not to argue with an enforcer.
Now, take that bottle!
- Go back.
Go back.
- Close it!
Close that door.
That's an order!
Close it!
- You want to enforce it?
- Close it, man!
Go back, man!
Go back, man!
Go back!
Close the door!
Are all the doors unlocked?
They haven't worked in generations.
- Then come out.
- No, no, we can't!
- No, no, no.
- We're prisoners.
Our fathers were prisoners.
Our mothers were prisoners.
It is the way of the universe.
Felgercarb!
You have rights, freedom.
You're human beings!
If you want to live in an Ambrosa stupor, fine, but what about your children?
Oh, they will contribute as we have - making Ambrosa for the Colonial warriors.
All the Ambrosa ever made here is ageing on the loading docks!
The Colonies long ago forgot these penal asteroids even exist.
They thought they were lost early in the war!
He lies.
Tell us the last time a Colonial freighter docked here.
Silence him.
You haven't helped the Colonies, you've just kept the enforcers in power!
- You daggits.
- Back in your cell, Assault 9!
- ls what he says true?
- He's a dirty, lying bootlegger!
- l am a Colonial warrior.
- (Prisoners) Warrior?
Show us the loading docks, Croad.
(Yells)
Go back in your cells!
All of you!
Man, liberation is great, huh?
Oh, by God, lad, I never thought in my lifetime I'd smell the sweet smell of air!
(Starbuck) That's freedom.
How...how much Ambrosa do you figure is out here?
The labour of a thousand lifetimes.
(Ships approaching)
Cylons!
I told you, he's a Cylon spy!
If I am, I'm in big trouble.
Those are Colonial vipers.
(Engines running down)
- Apollo!
- Starbuck!
Apollo, this asteroid is piled high with Ambrosa!
Thousands, millions of crates of it.
Some of it ageing a millennium.
I give up. I just give up.
No, you don't understand.
- We're rich.
- l'll put that on your death stone.
- My death stone?
- We can't raise the Galactica.
She must have altered course.
Son, we thought we'd never...
You!
I want to talk to you!
- You...
- That can wait.
Our sensors picked up Cylon fighters.
(All) Death to the Cylons!
Robber, get those people to cover.
Back in the block.
Let's move!
Back in the block, come on.
- You'll have to fly the recon viper.
- She doesn't have lasers.
But she's fast.
Starbuck, get the Cylons' attention.
We'll surprise them.
- Wake up, CORA.
- 'Starbuck!
'
Save the welcome for later.
We got three Cylons on our tail.
'Computing.
Estimate they will fire in .85 microns.'
Engage booster one micron before.
'Anything you say, honey.
'Hang on.'
He's got them occupied.
Let's go.
'Here they come again.'
- They're splitting up.
- l'll take the left.
- 'Here they come.'
- Execute a maximum G climb.
- 'You'll black out.
You're only human.'
- You're not.
- 'l'm beginning to regret that.'
- So am I.
Ready...
Now!
'Starbuck?
Starbuck?
'
(Cheering)
'Starbuck?
Starbuck?
- 'Honey?
'
- CORA.
We did it.
- We did it!
- 'Of course we did it.
'The Cylon couldn't match my pull-up.
'lt crashed into the structures 2.7 metrons east of the castle.
'l'm scanning a regular inferno down there.
'These structures contained highly volatile fluids.'
Oh, frack!
There goes my fortune.
Commander, long-range scan indicates ships approaching.
It's quadrant Omega Alpha 6.
Lead ship identification coming through.
- lt's Recon Viper 1 .
- Are you certain?
Positive.
We're receiving the marker beacon.
He's leading two vipers and a shuttle craft.
It's Starbuck and Apollo's patrol.
Well, Colonel, inform Boxey his father's coming home.
With pleasure, sir.
We have our warriors back and we welcome a good many voyagers who are complaining rather vociferously about the quality of our Ambrosa.
And Boxey has something for his father.
He worked very hard on that.
What a beautiful map.
- Look at this.
- Yes, he really did a good job here.
Will you be an astro-navigator?
No, a viper pilot like my father.
That's really very good.
But this blue planet is out of orbit.
It belongs here.
How do you know that?
I don't know.
I guess I saw it somewhere or...
No, I got it.
That cell l was in was covered with pictures and charts.
This system was one of them.
The Silent One.
It's a prisoner my father told me about.
Enforcers found him drifting in space.
He never said a word, just spent his time drawing those pictures.
Why?
is it important?
Well, the solar system that I taught Boxey to draw... was something that I'd remembered from our ancient legends.
It was the solar system that contained the planet Earth.
(Adama) 'Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny, 'the last battlestar, Galactica, 'leads a ragtag fugitive fleet 'on a lonely quest - 'a shining planet 'known as Earth.'
ST US By Tchen ..
We're leaving our star system.
They removed the laser generator.
Makes sense.
Get rid of the laser generators and... you're unarmed!
You haven't helped the Colonies, you've just kept the enforcers in power!
We must assume a Cylon has captured or killed Lieutenant Starbuck.
Cylons!
I told you, he's a Cylon spy!
If I am, I'm in big trouble.
'There are those who believe 'that life here 'began out there, 'far across the universe, 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans.
'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens.'
We are nearly through the asteroid dust, Commander.
I'm as nervous as a...
young cadet on his first orbit.
I'm not nervous.
I don't even know what to be nervous about.
We're leaving our star system.
When we get through this asteroid dust, there'll be a new galaxy.
One no human in this fleet has seen before.
- Commander.
- Yes.
Hush up.
It's just a bunch of old stars.
Perhaps Boxey should take the helm.
He has a singular perspective.
- Can I?
- No, you cannot.
You are centons into your sleep period.
- Oh.
Commander?
- Keep me out of this, young man.
I may be the commander but he's your father.
Thank you.
Next time I'll act excited and maybe we could stay up.
Come on, Muffit.
- Was I ever like that?
- Worse.
Initial readings are negative on any signs of life in the first quadrant, sir.
When the fleet has cleared the asteroid dust, concentrate sensors forward
- to increase our range.
- Yes, sir.
- Who's our volunteer?
- Starbuck.
- Starbuck?
- Starbuck?
Volunteer?
I don't think it was his sense of duty.
The first pilot to fly the new recon viper goes to the head of the list.
Let's not deprecate Starbuck.
It could be a dangerous mission.
- No, sir.
- What's Starbuck's status?
He's due on the Rising Star at any moment.
I hope we don't have to move him to red before he eats.
Starbuck did ask me to dinner tonight but...
Well, I do have this duty.
I guess he'll have to eat alone.
Well, er...perhaps this once we can make an exception, hm?
You go ahead and join him.
I'll handle this with Colonel Tigh.
I've sailed the Rising Star hundreds of times.
This reminds me of the old days - before the war.
Anyhow, look, it may be a while before I get another chance to come here for dinner.
Big mission coming up.
Do you have a private dining room?
Lieutenant, private rooms are reserved 60 and 70 centares in advance.
Well, one can always make arrangements for a warrior on his last night.
I don't like the way he said that.
- What's this about a mission?
- It's just a routine recon flight but don't tell him that.
Will this do, Lieutenant?
Perfect.
And a bottle of your finest Ambrosa.
Ambrosa's as rare as tylinium.
I'll see what I can do, sir.
Starbuck...
This is all so beautiful.
Most men don't treat a med technician like this.
I think of you only as a woman.
A very rare and beautiful woman.
I'll try to live up to that image.
Be back in a centon.
Commander, the long-range scanner indicates possible life forms.
Quadrant Alpha 6.
- Request probe concentration.
- Concentration's approved.
- Cylons?
- Impossible to tell.
- Prepare Recon Viper 1.
- Yes, sir.
Probe indicates definite life signs.
Er...
Athena!
I managed to get off work after all.
I just didn't want you to be alone on your last night before...
- You are alone, aren't you?
- Oh, er... well, not any longer.
Sir?
Yes?
Ah.
Listen, there...
You don't have a room with a better view?
There's a sanitation ship off our beam.
Not exactly appetizing scenery.
- A sanitation ship?
Where?
- It must have drifted back.
I think there's a first orbit cadet at the controls.
Get me another room.
Yes, sir, I quite understand.
Good.
- Follow me.
- Er...
Athena?
Asteroid concentration, binary star system.
Alpha 6, mark 775.
That's within a hectare of our course.
Yes.
I hope Lieutenant Starbuck has had time to finish his dinner.
Starbuck, these mushies are just heavenly.
Oh, er..
No, thanks.
Too bad we can't have any fresh protein with them.
I'll see what I can do.
- Wait.
Just buzz the waiter.
- Oh, no.
It's too slow.
I'll be back in a flash.
What happened?
They're all out of mushies.
I'm sorry.
I don't mind.
The protein's just fine.
This stuff's only a yahren old.
Well, I think it has the right effect.
So I see.
'Lieutenant Starbuck, report to Battlestar Galactica, flight deck blue.
'Lieutenant Starbuck, report to Battlestar Galactica, flight deck blue, priority red.'
- Oh, Starbuck.
- Duty calls, love.
Here.
Oh!
- Duty calls, love.
- I'm going with you.
No.
No you're not.
This dinner is costing every cubit I've got.
One of us is going to enjoy it.
Don't move.
I want to remember you just as you are.
Beautiful against the stars.
Sir.
Well...no need for cubits where I'm going.
Thank you, sir.
And may I say I admire the lieutenant's daring.
Well, it's just another mission.
No, sir.
I'm referring to the two young ladies.
Very pre-war.
Why!
Why, that...!
Oh, well, my, my, my.
Don't we look just precious?
Commander's orders.
In case I have to land.
Don't want everyone to know I'm a Colonial warrior.
Starbuck, you never look like a warrior.
Enjoy your dinner?
Well, let's just say I'm looking forward to a few centons in space - alone.
Just me, a fast ship and a fair galaxy.
A fast ship you have.
They've doubled range and speed and installed a voice-activated computer that can outfly the Cylons.
Hot pilot doesn't need all that electronic felgercarb.
Switch on your short-range marker beacon so we can track you.
No other transmissions unless essential, then only in scrambled code.
We don't want the Cylons tracing you back to us.
And, er, Starbuck...
if the Cylons should spot you...
I know.
I know, it's a one-way voyage.
Can't have them tracking me back to the fleet.
- Twice as fast?
- You'll love her.
They put a second pulse generator on all engines.
- It doesn't look bigger.
- She's not.
You can't add weight without getting rid of something.
- They removed the laser generators.
- Oh.
Transferring launch control to Recon Viper 1.
Launch when ready.
Makes sense.
Get rid of the laser generators and... you're unarmed!
Wish we were with him.
Yeah, so do I.
Short-range beacon on and functioning.
Recon Viper 1 indicating light speed and accelerating.
OK, baby, let's see what you can do.
Whoo!
Fantastic.
Incredible.
I'd like to see a computer do that.
'You asked for it.'
Whoa!
- Computer, back to normal track.
- 'Your wish is my command, honey.'
- The name's Starbuck.
- 'Don't be a bore.
My name's CORA.
'Short for Computer Oral Response Activated.
'I'm programmed to respond instantly to all your needs.
'I'm also to keep you amused over the duration of our prolonged voyage.
'We're on a Delta vector for quadrant Alpha 6.
'I've activated my sensors and am probing the asteroid area 'where life forms were reported by Galactica's rather limited scanner.'
- Do I detect jealousy?
- 'Quiet please, I'm scanning.'
Excuse me.
'I have two unidentified sub-light vehicles bearing Omega 1, Alpha 6.
'Shall we investigate?
'
What do we do if they're Cylons, wave?
'We have enough speed to outrun anything in the universe.
Hang on.
'Slowing to sub-light speed.
Let's not barge in until we know what they are.'
- Who they are.
- 'Excuse me.
'I'm putting them on the screen.
Visual contact in .15 centons.'
- They're ancient.
- 'Sixth millennium fighter craft.
'They're probably not Cylon.
Feel better, honey?
'
No, I don't like to see any unarmed craft being chased by a fighter.
Not this time, Robber.
'May I suggest a high-speed flyby 'kicking in our second booster within 50 metrons?
'Our backwash should knock him silly 'and scare the pogees out of him.'
- Release controls.
- 'Released.'
Croad here.
Lost contact.
Returning to Proteus.
'You were 52 metrons away when you used your booster.'
- It worked, didn't it?
- 'Rather sloppily.'
- Listen...
- 'Fighter is disengaging 'and turning for asteroid .71 hectares distant.
'Shuttlecraft has been damaged and is landing on asteroid ahead.
- 'What shall we do?
'
- Follow the shuttle.
'May I land us, or do I have to go through a bouncer?
'
Just give me the vector.
'Vector's displayed.
'Please, try not to jar my chips.
'Switching all systems except marker beacon to standby mode.'
Yo!
You all right?
Drop it.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were the pirate that was chasing me.
They're probably from the Frodo system.
Nasty bunch.
I don't know why I crossed this asteroid belt.
- I said drop it.
- I don't blame you for being cautious.
I'm a shuttle driver with agro parts for the farmers on Crodan.
Crodan?
What's that?
What settlement?
It's a small, primitive settlement that's never seen a beauty like the one you're flying.
- You're not from this system?
- I'll ask the questions.
I know.
I just like to know where I stand.
Are you a pirate?
You want to check my cargo?
Go on.
- It's not worth much.
- Think I will.
Uh-uh-uh!
Agro parts for some farmer on Crodan?
Aye, and that, too.
This is Ambrosa.
It must be more than 50 yahren old.
500 to be exact.
Five...?
That's impossible.
There hasn't been any of this around the star system since the war.
- What star system?
- Where'd you get this?
It can't be real.
Are you a bootlegger?
Try it.
I will.
Mmm.
By all that's holy.
I got a lot more.
If you'd keep your mouth shut,
I'd be glad to share my find with you.
This is worth a fortune.
How much is there?
A lot more than you or I could haul out of here.
But your ship doesn't look like it was made for cargo.
It looks like...
Now, wait a minute.
You're not the pirate?
You're not going to kill me?
Well, I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm a little leery of pirates myself.
I don't blame you.
- How many of those guys are there?
- This is a pretty rough sector.
Dozens of asteroids where they can hide and attack an unsuspecting ship.
You wouldn't be an advance scout for some sort of convoy, would you?
No, no, no.
This'd be a very bad place to bring an unarmed ship.
That it would.
Tell me, what kind of range do you figure those pirates have?
I don't really know...
I'm sorry, lad, but that beauty you're flying is the answer to all my dreams.
Commander, short-range beacon indicates
Recon Viper 1 climbing back into orbit.
Maintain tracking.
He may be onto something.
'Finally decided to turn me back on?
- 'Shall I scan for that fighter?
'
- Negative.
'Identify.'
- Are you capable of flying this ship?
- 'Affirmative.
- 'Identify.'
- All right, then, control is yours.
Assume course to asteroid mass 1.0775, bearing Delta 7.
'Computed.
Where's Starbuck?
'
Prepare to transmit intergalactic transmitter reach.
'Displayed.
What happened to Starbuck?
'
Stand by to transmit.
Commander!
Long-range transmissions being sent by Recon Viper 1.
- Are you sure it's long-range?
- Narrow beam.
- It's a code but not scrambled.
- What's that fool doing?
- An inoperative short-post transmitter?
- It's possible, Father.
But why an unknown code and unscrambled?
I suggest we check the Cylon codes, sir.
Do it.
We are picking up a transmission in a strange code.
- Launch fighters to investigate.
- By your command.
No response to known Cylon code patterns.
Commander, we must assume a Cylon has captured or killed Lieutenant Starbuck and now has command of Recon Viper 1.
That transmission is being beamed at our old home galaxy.
If it's not a message to the Cylons, it's a beacon directing them here.
That transmission must be stopped.
Alert my son.
We are to destroy Recon Viper 1.
Can't we try to make communication first?
If the recon viper starts the pulse generators, we'll be eating ion vapours.
- Captain, Starbuck...
- Probably dead, Boomer.
Transferring launch control to viper fighters.
Launch when ready.
Oh, no.
It's like trying to fly a museum.
CORA, where are you when I need you?
Come on, baby, ignite.
Orbit.
Goodbye, Robber.
I'm not Robber.
You're making a mistake.
'I'm not Robber.'
All right.
Now, you follow me and don't even think about running.
Name's Starbuck, privateer, Cyranus Galaxy.
A little misunderstanding.
Easy, easy, easy.
I just want to offer you guys a little drink.
Look, you've got me mixed up with another guy.
He took my ship and left me with his worthless load of agro parts.
Maybe we can make a deal.
Long-range transmissions have stopped.
Still picking up the short-range beacon.
It's coinciding with that asteroid, bearing Omega 7-5 relative.
Let's hope he stays there till we get there.
And then?
We carry out our mission.
Twice in one day.
It just isn't fair.
What's happening?
What is this place?
Well, now.
What have we here?
What's your name, lad?
- Starbuck.
- Starbuck?
Starbuck, you say, huh?
Hm, that's strange.
Never heard of that one before.
To our new mate, Starbuck.
Starbuck!
Starbuck!
Ambrosa.
And over 100 yahrens old.
Yes, yes, but they don't give us the good stuff.
- Where am I?
- Proteus Prison.
Oh, I'm Assault 9.
That's Forger 7 round the corner there.
Embezzler 10 down the block there and Adulteress 58, I see you've already met.
- Hand it over.
- And our, our children, of course.
What kind of offence is starbucking?
Sounds interesting.
- It's not an offence.
It's a name.
- They're one and the same, boy.
I wonder if our original sinners were as ignorant as this one.
- Original sinners?
- Yes, our ancestors.
The ones that were first sentenced here.
You're here for crimes committed by your ancestors?
At least we're not an original sinner like you.
Come on, now.
What is starbucking?
You can tell us.
It's a name.
I'm just a privateer from another galaxy.
Tell me, lad, any news about the war?
- The war?
- Yes.
Between the Colonies and the Alliance.
You know, we supply Ambrosa for the Colonial warriors.
- You what?
- We may be prisoners but we're as patriotic as any Colonist.
We used to supply munitions and Ambrosa for the war effort.
When the munitions ran out, we kept on making the only thing we could...
Ambrosa.
And we've been making it for 700 yahrens.
- Death to the Cylons!
- Death to the Cylons!
Death to the Cylons!
You sent for me?
Yes.
Station 8, please cover long scan.
Alpha mode for a centon.
Thank you.
Come here.
Starbuck is on a long-range patrol.
We are receiving intermittent transmissions in a code we can't decipher from his recon viper.
Therefore, we can only assume that he is no longer in command.
He may be lost... or dead.
In any case, we sent out a patrol to destroy his ship.
And even if he's still alive, without a ship...he can't get back.
I just thought you should know.
- Taking back the scanner.
- Athena, thank you.
Father, long-range transmissions from Recon Viper 1 resuming.
Same frequency and direction.
- Apollo's patrol status?
- They'll reach their site soon.
We've tried every known military code.
We can't break it.
- That's an Aerian merchant code.
- What?
My father was a merchant.
I used to transmit for him.
That looks like an Aerian merchant code.
A merchant code.
From the strength of that signal, we're close.
Activating attack computer.
Activating attack computer.
It's a request for the coordinates to Aeries!
Countermand the destruct orders.
'Blue Squadron patrol, disengage your attack.'
- The Galactica's countermanding.
- Pulling up.
Boomer, he's landing.
Let's investigate.
It must be a human who doesn't know that Aeries is in Cylon hands.
- Have Apollo investigate with caution.
- Yes, sir.
Tell him to stop that transmission.
Thank you for your help.
Well, you just saved some Aeries' life and maybe Starbuck's.
Let's hope so.
Of course, it won't change anything when he gets back.
I wouldn't want it any other way.
Looks deserted.
Only one way to find out.
He's been stripping the ship, making room for cargo.
- We're not going to find anything here.
- Uh-uh, my turn.
You've been around Starbuck too long.
Forgot how to take orders.
Thanks.
- That sure isn't Starbuck.
- Don't bet on it.
Ready?
Go!
- There he goes.
- Don't shoot, he's human.
No!
Apollo!
There's a woman and child here!
Don't hurt them.
Do what you want with me but don't hurt my wife and child.
I'm begging you.
My father taught me the merchant code like his father taught him.
Our original sinner was an Aerian robber.
These enforcers, their ancestors were the original guards?
In a strange way, those swine are as trapped as we are.
Why didn't you make for Aeries when you escaped from prison?
- I didn't have a capable ship.
- Till you stole Starbuck's viper.
He did it for Tania, so he did.
We couldn't stand seeing her raised in that prison.
I think I would have done the same.
Scanners indicate three Cylon fighters emerging from the asteroid dust cloud.
Omega, transfer long-range scanners to my console, please.
- Transferring.
- They're not following us.
They're heading for the asteroid where Recon Viper 1 landed.
And Apollo's patrol.
They must be scanning a narrow beam or they'd have picked us up.
Colonel... bring the fleet to flank speed...
and set a new course.
Put as much space as possible between ourselves and those fighters.
Commander, Apollo's patrol won't know where to find us.
Set the course, please.
Yes, sir.
Well.
Well, now, we have visitors.
What are you doing up at this time of night?
I don't sleep too good when my father isn't on board.
When is he coming back?
Well...you know your father's away on a very, very important mission.
It may be a little while yet.
But I miss him and so does Muffit.
Don't you, Muffit?
Yes, I'm sure you do miss him.
Do you miss him?
Yes, very much.
You know, when your father was as old as you are now... sometimes, when he couldn't sleep, he'd come into my room and climb into bed with me, and I'd tell him stories.
- Would you like me to tell you a story?
- Yeah.
- Tell me a story about Earth.
- Oh, about Earth.
All right.
Now, Earth... is a beautiful, blue-white planet...
Take your bottle, Bootlegger.
The name's Starbuck.
From now on your name is Bootlegger 137.
Put that on.
You'd better learn not to argue with an enforcer.
Now, take that bottle!
- Go back.
Go back.
- Close it!
Close that door.
That's an order!
Close it!
- You want to enforce it?
- Close it, man!
Go back, man!
Go back, man!
Go back!
Close the door!
Are all the doors unlocked?
They haven't worked in generations.
- Then come out.
- No, no, we can't!
- No, no, no.
- We're prisoners.
Our fathers were prisoners.
Our mothers were prisoners.
It is the way of the universe.
Felgercarb!
You have rights, freedom.
You're human beings!
If you want to live in an Ambrosa stupor, fine, but what about your children?
Oh, they will contribute as we have... making Ambrosa for the Colonial warriors.
All the Ambrosa ever made here is ageing on the loading docks!
The Colonies long ago forgot these penal asteroids even exist.
They thought they were lost early in the war!
He lies.
Tell us the last time a Colonial freighter docked here.
Silence him.
You haven't helped the Colonies, you've just kept the enforcers in power!
- You daggits.
- Back in your cell, Assault 9!
- Is what he says true?
- He's a dirty, lying bootlegger!
- I am a Colonial warrior.
- Warrior?
Show us the loading docks, Croad.
Go back in your cells!
All of you!
Man, liberation is great, huh?
Oh, by God, lad, I never thought in my lifetime
I'd smell the sweet smell of air!
That's freedom.
How...how much Ambrosa do you figure is out here?
The labour of a thousand lifetimes.
Cylons!
I told you, he's a Cylon spy!
If I am, I'm in big trouble.
Those are Colonial vipers.
- Apollo!
- Starbuck!
Apollo, this asteroid is piled high with Ambrosa!
Thousands, millions of crates of it.
Some of it ageing a millennium.
I give up.
I just give up.
No, you don't understand.
- We're rich.
- I'll put that on your death stone.
- My death stone?
- We can't raise the Galactica.
She must have altered course.
Son, we thought we'd never...
You!
I want to talk to you!
- You...
- That can wait.
Our sensors picked up Cylon fighters.
Death to the Cylons!
Robber, get those people to cover.
Back in the block.
Let's move!
Back in the block, come on.
- You'll have to fly the recon viper.
- She doesn't have lasers.
But she's fast.
Starbuck, get the Cylons' attention.
We'll surprise them.
- Wake up, CORA.
- 'Starbuck!
'
Save the welcome for later.
We got three Cylons on our tail.
'Computing.
Estimate they will fire in .85 microns.'
Engage booster one micron before.
'Anything you say, honey.
'Hang on.'
He's got them occupied.
Let's go.
'Here they come again.'
- They're splitting up.
- I'll take the left.
- 'Here they come.'
- Execute a maximum G climb.
- 'You'll black out.
You're only human.'
- You're not.
- 'I'm beginning to regret that.'
- So am I.
Ready...
Now!
'Starbuck?
Starbuck?
'
'Starbuck?
Starbuck?
- 'Honey?
'
- CORA.
We did it.
- We did it!
- 'Of course we did it.
'The Cylon couldn't match my pull-up.
'It crashed into the structures 2.7 metrons east of the castle.
'I'm scanning a regular inferno down there.
'These structures contained highly volatile fluids.'
Oh, frack!
There goes my fortune.
Commander, long-range scan indicates ships approaching.
It's quadrant Omega Alpha 6.
Lead ship identification coming through.
- It's Recon Viper 1.
- Are you certain?
Positive.
We're receiving the marker beacon.
He's leading two vipers and a shuttle craft.
It's Starbuck and Apollo's patrol.
Well, Colonel, inform Boxey his father's coming home.
With pleasure, sir.
We have our warriors back and we welcome a good many voyagers who are complaining rather vociferously about the quality of our Ambrosa.
And Boxey has something for his father.
He worked very hard on that.
What a beautiful map.
- Look at this.
- Yes, he really did a good job here.
Will you be an astro-navigator?
No, a viper pilot like my father.
That's really very good.
But this blue planet is out of orbit.
It belongs here.
How do you know that?
I don't know.
I guess I saw it somewhere or...
No, I got it.
That cell I was in was covered with pictures and charts.
This system was one of them.
The Silent One.
It's a prisoner my father told me about.
Enforcers found him drifting in space.
He never said a word, just spent his time drawing those pictures.
Why?
Is it important?
Well, the solar system that I taught Boxey to draw... was something that I'd remembered from our ancient legends.
It was the solar system that contained the planet Earth.
'Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny, 'the last battlestar, Galactica, 'leads a ragtag fugitive fleet 'on a lonely quest... 'a shining planet 'known as Earth.'
ST US By Tchen..
Sync error correction:
Ki3r
We're leaving our star system.
They removed the laser generator.
Makes sense.
Get rid of the laser generators and... you're unarmed!
You haven't helped the Colonies, you've just kept the enforcers in power!
We must assume a Cylon has captured or killed Lieutenant Starbuck.
Cylons!
I told you, he's a Cylon spy!
If I am, I'm in big trouble.
'There are those who believe 'that life here 'began out there, 'far across the universe, 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans.
'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens.'
We are nearly through the asteroid dust, Commander.
I'm as nervous as a...
young cadet on his first orbit.
I'm not nervous.
I don't even know what to be nervous about.
We're leaving our star system.
When we get through this asteroid dust, there'll be a new galaxy.
One no human in this fleet has seen before.
- Commander.
- Yes.
Hush up.
It's just a bunch of old stars.
Perhaps Boxey should take the helm.
He has a singular perspective.
- Can I?
- No, you cannot.
You are centons into your sleep period.
- Oh.
Commander?
- Keep me out of this, young man.
I may be the commander but he's your father.
Thank you.
Next time I'll act excited and maybe we could stay up.
Come on, Muffit.
- Was I ever like that?
- Worse.
Initial readings are negative on any signs of life in the first quadrant, sir.
When the fleet has cleared the asteroid dust, concentrate sensors forward
- to increase our range.
- Yes, sir.
- Who's our volunteer?
- Starbuck.
- Starbuck?
- Starbuck?
Volunteer?
I don't think it was his sense of duty.
Father's idea to reopen the dining lounge on the Rising Star was brilliant.
Only the waiting list is a yahren long.
The first pilot to fly the new recon viper goes to the head of the list.
Let's not deprecate Starbuck.
It could be a dangerous mission.
- No, sir.
- What's Starbuck's status?
He's due on the Rising Star at any moment.
I hope we don't have to move him to red before he eats.
Starbuck did ask me to dinner tonight but...
Well, I do have this duty.
I guess he'll have to eat alone.
Well, er... perhaps this once we can make an exception, hm?
You go ahead and join him.
I'll handle this with Colonel Tigh.
I've sailed the Rising Star hundreds of times.
This reminds me of the old days - before the war.
Anyhow, look, it may be a while before I get another chance to come here for dinner.
Big mission coming up.
Do you have a private dining room?
Lieutenant, private rooms are reserved 60 and 70 centares in advance.
Well, one can always make arrangements for a warrior on his last night.
I don't like the way he said that.
- What's this about a mission?
- It's just a routine recon flight but don't tell him that.
Will this do, Lieutenant?
Perfect.
And a bottle of your finest Ambrosa.
Ambrosa's as rare as tylinium.
I'll see what I can do, sir.
Starbuck...
This is all so beautiful.
Most men don't treat a med technician like this.
I think of you only as a woman.
A very rare and beautiful woman.
I'll try to live up to that image.
Be back in a centon.
Commander, the long-range scanner indicates possible life forms.
Quadrant Alpha 6.
- Request probe concentration.
- Concentration's approved.
- Cylons?
- Impossible to tell.
- Prepare Recon Viper 1.
- Yes, sir.
Probe indicates definite life signs.
Er...
Athena!
I managed to get off work after all.
I just didn't want you to be alone on your last night before...
- You are alone, aren't you?
- Oh, er... well, not any longer.
Sir?
Yes?
Ah.
Listen, there...
You don't have a room with a better view?
There's a sanitation ship off our beam.
Not exactly appetizing scenery.
- A sanitation ship?
Where?
- It must have drifted back.
I think there's a first orbit cadet at the controls.
Get me another room.
Yes, sir, I quite understand.
Good.
- Follow me.
- Er...
Athena?
Asteroid concentration, binary star system.
Alpha 6, mark 775.
That's within a hectare of our course.
Yes.
I hope Lieutenant Starbuck has had time to finish his dinner.
Starbuck, these mushies are just heavenly.
Oh, er..
No, thanks.
Too bad we can't have any fresh protein with them.
I'll see what I can do.
- Wait.
Just buzz the waiter.
- Oh, no.
It's too slow.
I'll be back in a flash.
What happened?
They're all out of mushies.
I'm sorry.
I don't mind.
The protein's just fine.
This stuff's only a yahren old.
Well, I think it has the right effect.
So I see.
'Lieutenant Starbuck, report to Battlestar Galactica, flight deck blue.
'Lieutenant Starbuck, report to Battlestar Galactica, flight deck blue, priority red.'
- Oh, Starbuck.
- Duty calls, love.
Here.
Oh!
- Duty calls, love.
- I'm going with you.
No.
No you're not.
This dinner is costing every cubit I've got.
One of us is going to enjoy it.
Don't move.
I want to remember you just as you are.
Beautiful against the stars.
Sir.
Well... no need for cubits where I'm going.
Thank you, sir.
And may I say I admire the lieutenant's daring.
Well, it's just another mission.
No, sir.
I'm referring to the two young ladies.
Very pre-war.
Why!
Why, that...!
Oh, well, my, my, my.
Don't we look just precious?
Commander's orders.
In case I have to land.
Don't want everyone to know I'm a Colonial warrior.
Starbuck, you never look like a warrior.
Enjoy your dinner?
Well, let's just say I'm looking forward to a few centons in space - alone.
Just me, a fast ship and a fair galaxy.
A fast ship you have.
They've doubled range and speed and installed a voice-activated computer that can outfly the Cylons.
Hot pilot doesn't need all that electronic felgercarb.
Switch on your short-range marker beacon so we can track you.
No other transmissions unless essential, then only in scrambled code.
We don't want the Cylons tracing you back to us.
And, er, Starbuck...
if the Cylons should spot you...
I know.
I know, it's a one-way voyage.
Can't have them tracking me back to the fleet.
- Twice as fast?
- You'll love her.
They put a second pulse generator on all engines.
- It doesn't look bigger.
- She's not.
You can't add weight without getting rid of something.
- They removed the laser generators.
- Oh.
Transferring launch control to Recon Viper 1.
Launch when ready.
Makes sense.
Get rid of the laser generators and... you're unarmed!
Wish we were with him.
Yeah, so do I.
Short-range beacon on and functioning.
Recon Viper 1 indicating light speed and accelerating.
OK, baby, let's see what you can do.
Whoo!
Fantastic.
Incredible.
I'd like to see a computer do that.
'You asked for it.'
Whoa!
- Computer, back to normal track.
- 'Your wish is my command, honey.'
- The name's Starbuck.
- 'Don't be a bore.
My name's CORA.
'Short for Computer Oral Response Activated.
'I'm programmed to respond instantly to all your needs.
'I'm also to keep you amused over the duration of our prolonged voyage.
'We're on a Delta vector for quadrant Alpha 6.
'I've activated my sensors and am probing the asteroid area 'where life forms were reported by Galactica's rather limited scanner.'
- Do I detect jealousy?
- 'Quiet please, I'm scanning.'
Excuse me.
'I have two unidentified sub-light vehicles bearing Omega 1, Alpha 6.
'Shall we investigate?
'
What do we do if they're Cylons, wave?
'We have enough speed to outrun anything in the universe.
Hang on.
'Slowing to sub-light speed.
Let's not barge in until we know what they are.'
- Who they are.
- 'Excuse me.
'I'm putting them on the screen.
Visual contact in. 15 centons.'
- They're ancient.
- 'Sixth millennium fighter craft.
'They're probably not Cylon.
Feel better, honey?
'
No, I don't like to see any unarmed craft being chased by a fighter.
Not this time, Robber.
'May I suggest a high-speed flyby 'kicking in our second booster within 50 metrons?
'Our backwash should knock him silly 'and scare the pogees out of him.'
- Release controls.
- 'Released.'
Croad here.
Lost contact.
Returning to Proteus.
'You were 52 metrons away when you used your booster.'
- It worked, didn't it?
- 'Rather sloppily.'
- Listen...
- 'Fighter is disengaging 'and turning for asteroid .71 hectares distant.
'Shuttlecraft has been damaged and is landing on asteroid ahead.
- 'What shall we do?
'
- Follow the shuttle.
'May I land us, or do I have to go through a bouncer?
'
Just give me the vector.
'Vector's displayed.
'Please, try not to jar my chips.
'Switching all systems except marker beacon to standby mode.'
Yo!
You all right?
Drop it.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were the pirate that was chasing me.
They're probably from the Frodo system.
Nasty bunch.
I don't know why I crossed this asteroid belt.
- I said drop it.
- I don't blame you for being cautious.
I'm a shuttle driver with agro parts for the farmers on Crodan.
Crodan?
What's that?
What settlement?
It's a small, primitive settlement that's never seen a beauty like the one you're flying.
- You're not from this system?
- I'll ask the questions.
I know.
I just like to know where I stand.
Are you a pirate?
You want to check my cargo?
Go on.
- It's not worth much.
- Think I will.
Uh-uh-uh!
Agro parts for some farmer on Crodan?
Aye, and that, too.
This is Ambrosa.
It must be more than 50 yahren old.
500 to be exact.
Five...?
That's impossible.
There hasn't been any of this around the star system since the war.
- What star system?
- Where'd you get this?
It can't be real.
Are you a bootlegger?
Try it.
I will.
Mmm.
By all that's holy.
I got a lot more.
If you'd keep your mouth shut,
I'd be glad to share my find with you.
This is worth a fortune.
How much is there?
A lot more than you or I could haul out of here.
But your ship doesn't look like it was made for cargo.
It looks like...
Now, wait a minute.
You're not the pirate?
You're not going to kill me?
Well, I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm a little leery of pirates myself.
I don't blame you.
- How many of those guys are there?
- This is a pretty rough sector.
Dozens of asteroids where they can hide and attack an unsuspecting ship.
You wouldn't be an advance scout for some sort of convoy, would you?
No, no, no.
This'd be a very bad place to bring an unarmed ship.
That it would.
Tell me, what kind of range do you figure those pirates have?
I don't really know...
I'm sorry, lad, but that beauty you're flying is the answer to all my dreams.
Commander, short-range beacon indicates
Recon Viper 1 climbing back into orbit.
Maintain tracking.
He may be onto something.
'Finally decided to turn me back on?
- 'Shall I scan for that fighter?
'
- Negative.
'Identify.'
- Are you capable of flying this ship?
- 'Affirmative.
- 'Identify.'
- All right, then, control is yours.
Assume course to asteroid mass 1.0775, bearing Delta 7.
'Computed.
Where's Starbuck?
'
Prepare to transmit intergalactic transmitter reach.
'Displayed.
What happened to Starbuck?
'
Stand by to transmit.
Commander!
Long-range transmissions being sent by Recon Viper 1.
- Are you sure it's long-range?
- Narrow beam.
- It's a code but not scrambled.
- What's that fool doing?
- An inoperative short-post transmitter?
- It's possible, Father.
But why an unknown code and unscrambled?
I suggest we check the Cylon codes, sir.
Do it.
We are picking up a transmission in a strange code.
- Launch fighters to investigate.
- By your command.
No response to known Cylon code patterns.
Commander, we must assume a Cylon has captured or killed Lieutenant Starbuck and now has command of Recon Viper 1.
That transmission is being beamed at our old home galaxy.
If it's not a message to the Cylons, it's a beacon directing them here.
That transmission must be stopped.
Alert my son.
We are to destroy Recon Viper 1.
Can't we try to make communication first?
If the recon viper starts the pulse generators, we'll be eating ion vapours.
- Captain, Starbuck...
- Probably dead, Boomer.
Transferring launch control to viper fighters.
Launch when ready.
Oh, no.
It's like trying to fly a museum.
CORA, where are you when I need you?
Come on, baby, ignite.
Orbit.
Goodbye, Robber.
I'm not Robber.
You're making a mistake.
'I'm not Robber.'
All right.
Now, you follow me and don't even think about running.
Name's Starbuck, privateer, Cyranus Galaxy.
A little misunderstanding.
Easy, easy, easy.
I just want to offer you guys a little drink.
Look, you've got me mixed up with another guy.
He took my ship and left me with his worthless load of agro parts.
Maybe we can make a deal.
Long-range transmissions have stopped.
Still picking up the short-range beacon.
It's coinciding with that asteroid, bearing Omega 7-5 relative.
Let's hope he stays there till we get there.
And then?
We carry out our mission.
Twice in one day.
It just isn't fair.
What's happening?
What is this place?
Well, now.
What have we here?
What's your name, lad?
- Starbuck.
- Starbuck?
Starbuck, you say, huh?
Hm, that's strange.
Never heard of that one before.
To our new mate, Starbuck.
Starbuck!
Starbuck!
Ambrosa.
And over 100 yahrens old.
Yes, yes, but they don't give us the good stuff.
- Where am I?
- Proteus Prison.
Oh, I'm Assault 9.
That's Forger 7 round the corner there.
Embezzler 10 down the block there and Adulteress 58, I see you've already met.
- Hand it over.
- And our, our children, of course.
What kind of offence is starbucking?
Sounds interesting.
- It's not an offence.
It's a name.
- They're one and the same, boy.
I wonder if our original sinners were as ignorant as this one.
- Original sinners?
- Yes, our ancestors.
The ones that were first sentenced here.
You're here for crimes committed by your ancestors?
At least we're not an original sinner like you.
Come on, now.
What is starbucking?
You can tell us.
It's a name.
I'm just a privateer from another galaxy.
Tell me, lad, any news about the war?
- The war?
- Yes.
Between the Colonies and the Alliance.
You know, we supply Ambrosa for the Colonial warriors.
- You what?
- We may be prisoners but we're as patriotic as any Colonist.
We used to supply munitions and Ambrosa for the war effort.
When the munitions ran out, we kept on making the only thing we could -
Ambrosa.
And we've been making it for 700 yahrens.
- Death to the Cylons!
- Death to the Cylons!
Death to the Cylons!
You sent for me?
Yes.
Station 8, please cover long scan.
Alpha mode for a centon.
Thank you.
Come here.
Starbuck is on a long-range patrol.
We are receiving intermittent transmissions in a code we can't decipher from his recon viper.
Therefore, we can only assume that he is no longer in command.
He may be lost... or dead.
In any case, we sent out a patrol to destroy his ship.
And even if he's still alive, without a ship... he can't get back.
I just thought you should know.
- Taking back the scanner.
- Athena, thank you.
Father, long-range transmissions from Recon Viper 1 resuming.
Same frequency and direction.
- Apollo's patrol status?
- They'll reach their site soon.
We've tried every known military code.
We can't break it.
- That's an Aerian merchant code.
- What?
My father was a merchant.
I used to transmit for him.
That looks like an Aerian merchant code.
A merchant code.
From the strength of that signal, we're close.
Activating attack computer.
Activating attack computer.
It's a request for the coordinates to Aeries!
Countermand the destruct orders.
'Blue Squadron patrol, disengage your attack.'
- The Galactica's countermanding.
- Pulling up.
Boomer, he's landing.
Let's investigate.
It must be a human who doesn't know that Aeries is in Cylon hands.
- Have Apollo investigate with caution.
- Yes, sir.
Tell him to stop that transmission.
Thank you for your help.
Well, you just saved some Aeries' life and maybe Starbuck's.
Let's hope so.
Of course, it won't change anything when he gets back.
I wouldn't want it any other way.
Looks deserted.
Only one way to find out.
He's been stripping the ship, making room for cargo.
- We're not going to find anything here.
- Uh-uh, my turn.
You've been around Starbuck too long.
Forgot how to take orders.
Thanks.
- That sure isn't Starbuck.
- Don't bet on it.
Ready?
Go!
- There he goes.
- Don't shoot, he's human.
No!
Apollo!
There's a woman and child here!
Don't hurt them.
Do what you want with me but don't hurt my wife and child.
I'm begging you.
My father taught me the merchant code like his father taught him.
Our original sinner was an Aerian robber.
These enforcers, their ancestors were the original guards?
In a strange way, those swine are as trapped as we are.
Why didn't you make for Aeries when you escaped from prison?
- I didn't have a capable ship.
- Till you stole Starbuck's viper.
He did it for Tania, so he did.
We couldn't stand seeing her raised in that prison.
I think I would have done the same.
Scanners indicate three Cylon fighters emerging from the asteroid dust cloud.
Omega, transfer long-range scanners to my console, please.
- Transferring.
- They're not following us.
They're heading for the asteroid where Recon Viper 1 landed.
And Apollo's patrol.
They must be scanning a narrow beam or they'd have picked us up.
Colonel... bring the fleet to flank speed...
and set a new course.
Put as much space as possible between ourselves and those fighters.
Commander, Apollo's patrol won't know where to find us.
Set the course, please.
Yes, sir.
Well.
Well, now, we have visitors.
What are you doing up at this time of night?
I don't sleep too good when my father isn't on board.
When is he coming back?
Well... you know your father's away on a very, very important mission.
It may be a little while yet.
But I miss him and so does Muffit.
Don't you, Muffit?
Yes, I'm sure you do miss him.
Do you miss him?
Yes, very much.
You know, when your father was as old as you are now... sometimes, when he couldn't sleep, he'd come into my room and climb into bed with me, and I'd tell him stories.
- Would you like me to tell you a story?
- Yeah.
- Tell me a story about Earth.
- Oh, about Earth.
All right.
Now, Earth... is a beautiful, blue-white planet...
Take your bottle, Bootlegger.
The name's Starbuck.
From now on your name is Bootlegger 137.
Put that on.
You'd better learn not to argue with an enforcer.
Now, take that bottle!
- Go back.
Go back.
- Close it!
Close that door.
That's an order!
Close it!
- You want to enforce it?
- Close it, man!
Go back, man!
Go back, man!
Go back!
Close the door!
Are all the doors unlocked?
They haven't worked in generations.
- Then come out.
- No, no, we can't!
- No, no, no.
- We're prisoners.
Our fathers were prisoners.
Our mothers were prisoners.
It is the way of the universe.
Felgercarb!
You have rights, freedom.
You're human beings!
If you want to live in an Ambrosa stupor, fine, but what about your children?
Oh, they will contribute as we have - making Ambrosa for the Colonial warriors.
All the Ambrosa ever made here is ageing on the loading docks!
The Colonies long ago forgot these penal asteroids even exist.
They thought they were lost early in the war!
He lies.
Tell us the last time a Colonial freighter docked here.
Silence him.
You haven't helped the Colonies, you've just kept the enforcers in power!
- You daggits.
- Back in your cell, Assault 9!
- Is what he says true?
- He's a dirty, lying bootlegger!
- I am a Colonial warrior.
- Warrior?
Show us the loading docks, Croad.
Go back in your cells!
All of you!
Man, liberation is great, huh?
Oh, by God, lad, I never thought in my lifetime
I'd smell the sweet smell of air!
That's freedom.
How... how much Ambrosa do you figure is out here?
The labour of a thousand lifetimes.
Cylons!
I told you, he's a Cylon spy!
If I am, I'm in big trouble.
Those are Colonial vipers.
- Apollo!
- Starbuck!
Apollo, this asteroid is piled high with Ambrosa!
Thousands, millions of crates of it.
Some of it ageing a millennium.
I give up.
I just give up.
No, you don't understand.
- We're rich.
- I'll put that on your death stone.
- My death stone?
- We can't raise the Galactica.
She must have altered course.
Son, we thought we'd never...
You!
I want to talk to you!
- You...
- That can wait.
Our sensors picked up Cylon fighters.
Death to the Cylons!
Robber, get those people to cover.
Back in the block.
Let's move!
Back in the block, come on.
- You'll have to fly the recon viper.
- She doesn't have lasers.
But she's fast.
Starbuck, get the Cylons' attention.
We'll surprise them.
- Wake up, CORA.
- 'Starbuck!
'
Save the welcome for later.
We got three Cylons on our tail.
'Computing.
Estimate they will fire in. 85 microns.'
Engage booster one micron before.
'Anything you say, honey.
'Hang on.'
He's got them occupied.
Let's go.
'Here they come again.'
- They're splitting up.
- I'll take the left.
- 'Here they come.'
- Execute a maximum G climb.
- 'You'll black out.
You're only human.'
- You're not.
- 'I'm beginning to regret that.'
- So am I.
Ready...
Now!
'Starbuck?
Starbuck?
'
'Starbuck?
Starbuck?
- 'Honey?
'
- CORA.
We did it.
- We did it!
- 'Of course we did it.
'The Cylon couldn't match my pull-up.
'It crashed into the structures 2.7 metrons east of the castle.
'I'm scanning a regular inferno down there.
'These structures contained highly volatile fluids.'
Oh, frack!
There goes my fortune.
Commander, long-range scan indicates ships approaching.
It's quadrant Omega Alpha 6.
Lead ship identification coming through.
- It's Recon Viper 1.
- Are you certain?
Positive.
We're receiving the marker beacon.
He's leading two vipers and a shuttle craft.
It's Starbuck and Apollo's patrol.
Well, Colonel, inform Boxey his father's coming home.
With pleasure, sir.
We have our warriors back and we welcome a good many voyagers who are complaining rather vociferously about the quality of our Ambrosa.
And Boxey has something for his father.
He worked very hard on that.
What a beautiful map.
- Look at this.
- Yes, he really did a good job here.
Will you be an astro-navigator?
No, a viper pilot like my father.
That's really very good.
But this blue planet is out of orbit.
It belongs here.
How do you know that?
I don't know.
I guess I saw it somewhere or...
No, I got it.
That cell I was in was covered with pictures and charts.
This system was one of them.
The Silent One.
It's a prisoner my father told me about.
Enforcers found him drifting in space.
He never said a word, just spent his time drawing those pictures.
Why?
Is it important?
Well, the solar system that I taught Boxey to draw... was something that I'd remembered from our ancient legends.
It was the solar system that contained the planet Earth.
'Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny, 'the last battlestar, Galactica, 'leads a ragtag fugitive fleet 'on a lonely quest - 'a shining planet 'known as Earth.'

- Then who does?

They're using the intakes!
Fire.

'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens.'
(Adama) 'In part one of Gun On Ice Planet Zero...'
I just have the feeling that we're being carefully manoeuvred.
We're being herded into this safe passage ahead.
(Centurion) Pump system to speed.
I'm picking up a flare.
A brilliant bead of light, like an eclipse.
I'm going to check it out.
Locked on target.
Fire.
(Starbuck) 'We're under attack.'
Battle stations!
Flight officer!
(Alarm)
Starbuck, they're forcing me down.
- Is it something serious?
- No.
We're just handing the fleet over to a bunch of criminals.
There's not much difference between you and your fellow convicts and us.
We are all live for the promise of freedom and fear the same death.
Cylons.
We're going down!
Search for wreckage.
Leave no survivors.
They're clones.
You came to destroy the Ravashol pulsar.
- Ravashol?
- He is the Father Creator.
- Cylon patrol.
- Everybody down.
(Adama) 'And now, the exciting conclusion of Gun On Ice Planet Zero.'
The way is clear now.
So you're not turning us in to the Cylons.
No, we hate the Cylons.
We are Theta-class life forms, considered by the Cylons to be subhuman.
We were created for slave labour.
Most of our brothers and sisters are still slaves.
But you revolted.
- Evidently we are not perfect.
- No.
Just human.
Will you help us destroy the pulsar?
First we must get into the village.
Come.
(Muffit barking)
This is the entrance to our underground city.
(Distant chatter)
This leads to the base of the research station.
We must get to the top of that mountain.
- There is one who can help.
- Who?
Father Creator
- Ravashol.
- He's here?
In the village?
- He lives at the base of Mount Hekla.
- You'll take me to him?
- To free my people?
Yes.
But first I'll take your people to safety.
The probe that landed on the planet's surface - it was destroyed?
Not exactly.
- Not exactly?
- Control yourself, my friend.
You'll blow a circuit, or I believe you call it a blood vessel.
Quite flimsy compared to...
I do not need a lesson in anatomy.
Where are our fighters?
Close to the point of no return.
Still hectares from the Galactica.
Have them attack the Galactica.
But they will not have enough fuel to return.
That's suicide.
- They're machines!
- We are all machines.
Even you, of a sort.
With a probe on the surface and possible survivors,
I must push the Galactica forward.
Even if they were human pilots, I would give the same order.
Yes, I believe you would.
By your command.
(Screams)
- Cylons are searching the village.
- Take the others and hide them.
- But where?
- With the children.
- Hear that, Muffit?
There are children!
- (Barks)
- Children?
- We were thought to be sterile.
It was a Cylon mandate to maintain the purity of the Theta life form.
- But we have been bearing children.
- And hiding them?
Yes.
Father Creator, please do not call for help.
You are not permitted here.
Only planners.
Father Creator, we are in need of your help.
- You're one of the 5 series.
- Yes.
Series 5, Culture 9.
You are not one of mine.
You're a human.
Flight Captain Apollo from the Battlestar Galactica.
The Galactica is a vessel of war.
I have no use for war or violence.
You have a strange way of showing it.
What's that on the mountain, a weapon of peace?
It is an energy lens system to transmit intelligence across the galaxy.
Your energy lens system has fried two of my fighters and is holding the Colonial fleet at bay until the Cylons can destroy it.
Impossible!
My system is maintained by Series 5 Theta life forms.
With all reverence, they are whipped if they come near the pulsar.
You are wrong!
I make adjustments, repairs, I transmit.
My helpers are Series 5!
Right now your pulsar is manned by Cylons as a weapon of war.
A temporary misuse.
A temporary abuse.
So you know how it's being used!
I have no control over the use of my creations!
- No responsibility!
- Then who does?
(Beep)
'Dr Ravashol, permission to enter.'
Cylons!
Behind the research stacks, in the equipment cases.
Hide him!
Enter.
Why did you keep us waiting?
Would you like me to ruin my work?
These are delicate compounds.
- Search.
- What do you think you're doing?
The garrison commander will hear of this.
- We have orders to search.
- We'll see about that.
This is Dr Ravashol.
I want to speak to the command Centurion.
'Dr Ravashol.'
Why is my work being disrupted?
There is a patrol here.
We are searching for humans.
I know nothing about humans.
Please order your Centurions to go so I may continue my work.
Only planners are permitted to visit you.
He's here because I need a strong back to move some equipment.
Leave Dr Ravashol to his research.
Punish the worker clone.
He's here at my orders!
(Woman) Cylons!
Cylons!
Help!
- This is our chance to go.
- We've more chance on the mountain.
Why couldn't you leave us alone?
If you hadn't come, all would be peaceful!
We had no choice.
The Cylons forced us here.
They are out to exterminate every human in the universe.
- Even you will go.
- They let me live.
They understand my work.
You want to destroy everything I've created.
Before you came, everything was in its place.
- Planners to think, workers to work.
- I've got news for you.
Your workers are thinking and breeding.
- Impossible.
- Tell that to the children they've hidden.
Children?
If you won't help me to save the lives in the fleet, do it for the Thetas.
In a sense, they're all your children.
We've picked up a Cylon fighter squadron.
- How many?
- An attack phalanx.
- They're beginning to press.
- Battle stations.
- Order Blue Squadron to patrol the rear.
- (Alarm)
(Rigel) 'Vector coordinates coded and transferred.
'Launch Bay Alpha, stand by to launch fighter patrol.
'Launch when ready.
'Enemy approaching.
100 microns and closing.'
- Protect the freighters.
- Blue Leader, engage.
Have our fighters engaged the Galactica?
Yes.
But they will not have enough fuel to return.
Break off the attack.
Baltar, I believe my sound sensor mishears you.
I said break off the attack!
It will force Adama to believe... that we are even closer than we are in actuality.
Very clever.
A little hard on our troops but very clever.
By your command.
Why are they withdrawing?
Secure quarters.
They'll be back in packs like wild animals.
How long until the landing party completes its mission?
Irrelevant.
We must move forward in exactly... 420 centons, whether they're successful or not.
There are two chambers, one housing the pulsar, the other a small garrison.
The only way to destroy it is to jam or reverse the main pump.
It's not easy but it can be done.
Here, here and here.
Quick, we must hide these humans.
(Yapping)
He won't hurt you!
He's just a daggit!
Where's Thane?
I don't know, maybe he got separated.
He's been looking for a chance to make a break.
- We'd better go find him.
- Wait.
Let us do it.
As you can see, strangers are easy to single out here.
Come.
What is your purpose here?
Just visiting.
How many of you are there?
I travel alone.
I've always been a little antisocial.
- You are from the Galactica.
- Never heard of it.
The Cylons have captured one of your party.
- I'll go.
- You're not going anywhere.
I need you to scale the mountain.
Take me to where they have Thane.
- The Cylons will recognise you.
- Not if I'm dressed like a Theta.
- All this risk for one man?
- He might betray us.
Are you sure it's Thane you want to save and not the other one?
Who else are you looking for?
It's a pilot I lost.
Just a kid, really.
His name's Cree.
If he survived, the Cylons will have him.
For his sake, I hope he didn't.
Take him to a cold cell.
I will examine his cortex later.
No!
No!
No!
How many combat ships in the fleet?
Tough question.
There's so many.
How many?
Starbuck!
- Where's Apollo?
- He is with Ravashol.
- Is he safe?
- He is in hiding.
Can Ravashol be trusted?
He saved Ser 5-9 from the Cylons.
- Looks like they caught you.
- Ravashol lied to save me.
I prefer being whipped to being killed.
In my inner pocket there's a tape coder.
The information you want is recorded in it.
Just press that button.
We'd better get back.
That's no way to greet a fellow warrior.
I left you in charge.
What happened?
Thane's dead.
- But he didn't betray us.
- We got a problem.
- Ravashol says...
- Father Creator helped you?
Yes.
He says our only chance is a simultaneous attack.
One garrison is stationed outside the pulsar, the other on the gun.
You're in charge of taking the garrison.
- I won't let you down.
- I'm counting on it.
- Let's set our timepieces at 200 centons.
- Got it.
We'll reach the top and start our attack in exactly 200 centons.
The Galactica will be moving forward after that.
- For all our sakes, don't be late.
- I'll be there.
One of the clones told me the Cylon fighters are located at the top of the mountain, just behind the pulsar emplacement.
When we get there, we grab one!
And go where?
How long before Galactica hunts us down?
The Galactica is the hunted.
Adama won't waste a squadron hunting down three ex-convicts.
He knows that!
Why are your sympathies with those who chained you?
The Galactica and the entire fleet are finished.
They will be if we don't knock out that pulsar.
Right.
They'll all be destroyed and we'll be free!
We can find another planet.
Starlos isn't far.
We can pick up food and water and fuel.
Are you with us, or are you going to turn your back on freedom again?
I could not shoot down a Colonial warrior.
Oh, yes, I know - the code, the bloodline.
And for all your compassion, they chained you like an animal!
Now is your chance!
Our chance.
One last time, my husband.
Are you with us?
I'm with you.
Good news.
Some of our fighters may have enough fuel to rendezvous with us.
Well, at least 30%.
Good.
Have them re-engage the Galactica.
But Baltar, they just disengaged.
Yes!
It will drive Adama crazy.
- He's not the only one.
- You said something?
By your command.
(Rigel) Enemy closing. 10 microns.
- (Adama) General quarters.
- Closing in, five microns.
(Rigel) Blue Squadron up.
Launch when ready.
Activate the laser turrets.
(Radio chatter)
Cylon attacking fighters have retreated but Cylon battlestars are entering the quadrant.
Our time is up, Colonel.
Flank speed ahead!
We're going right through.
By your command.
'Our base ships have arrived and are closing on the Galactica.
'What is the status of the pulsar?
'
- Fully operative.
- 'Initiate random firing.
'Sweep the entire corridor.
Begin at once.'
By your command.
Notify summit station.
Random sweeps covering the corridor.
(Alarm blaring)
Lens system aligned.
Pulsar ready to fire.
Commence firing.
(Adama) My God.
(Operator) Yes, I read you.
Fire.
Avalanche!
(Groaning)
That's one I owe you.
(Pulsar firing)
His leg - he'll never make it to the top of the mountain.
- Can you get him down?
- I think so.
- Do it!
- What about the pulsar?
We'll take it from here.
Let's go!
We've only got 80 centons left!
Fire.
(Omega) We're getting within range.
The expedition must have failed.
They still have 70 centons.
Fire.
(Rigel) It's closing. 68 centons.
If we're gonna go... it's got to be now!
(Pulsar firing)
I'm with you.
There's nowhere you can go, Wolfe!
There's a squadron of Cylon fighters the other side of the hill.
We're getting off this piece of ice.
There isn't time!
The Galactica's passing through the quadrant!
- We've got to silence that gun!
- I don't care about the Galactica.
The Galactica is the only ship in the galaxy that can protect you.
Without us you're finished!
I don't think you realise who is finished here.
The Cylons won't rest until we're all dead.
Don't worry, Captain, we're gonna make it.
- To where?
- Well, now... that isn't really going to matter... to you.
Wolfe!
(Apollo) Don't shoot!
He'll never make it.
He's not getting away, he's as good as dead.
We've got to go with him.
It's our only chance.
We're here on a mission - a mission to save the last remains of a once-civilised race.
And we're going to do it!
You understand that?
This mission goes through.
- (Pulsar fires)
- Let's get moving.
Time is running out.
I'm putting you in charge.
Get us into that pulsar station.
We've only got 62 centons.
We're approaching Cylon scanning range.
They'll have a fix on us at any moment.
Commander...
I suggest we let all the ships move at maximum speed.
We jeopardise the fleet if we maintain the speed of the slowest ship.
Execute.
Galactica to all ships.
Accelerate to maximum possible speed.
Increase interval spacing.
And good luck.
Where is the Galactica?
60 centons and closing.
50 centons and closing.
Maintain random firing.
Fire.
Hard to starboard.
42 centons.
I'll be with you as fast as I can.
- Where you going?
- To settle a debt.
- You're going to what?
- Don't wait more than 20 centons.
This is the intake for the cooling system.
Laser's inside.
We don't have enough solenite to blow it all up.
Ravashol said the key element is the energy exchange pump.
If we can wreck it, the gun will overload and blow itself up.
Let's take a look.
We've only got 35 centons to go.
I hope Starbuck's on schedule.
The emergency escape hatch.
The cold cells where the Cylons hold prisoners are directly below.
- There'll be guards.
- It'll take 'em by surprise.
Nobody breaks into prison.
- Starbuck!
- Can you walk?
- I can try.
- Let's go.
- Where is the Galactica?
- 30 centons and closing.
Fire.
- Hard to port.
- Helm hard to port.
- That was close.
- Hard to starboard.
Commander, we have to turn back.
We'll never make it.
(Rigel) 27 centons and closing.
Hold on!
They're using the intakes!
(Wind rushing)
Let's go!
Hurry up, we've only got 25 centons.
Come on.
In here.
Wait.
Listen...
- You risked your life to save his.
- Seemed like a good trade then.
You are very courageous.
I don't wish to betray my people but...
But what?
- They will help you destroy the Cylons.
- I know.
They will not allow you to destroy the pulsar.
How will they stop us?
Apollo and the others are setting the charges.
I do not know how, only that they will - by whatever means.
Let's talk to your people.
That's the firing station in the middle.
It controls the energy pump.
- Is that the target?
- Blow that and it overloads.
It'll blow off the top of the mountain.
20 centons.
Fire.
- Increase spacing between ships.
- Yes, sir.
Cylon base stars, quadrant Epsilon.
Closing rapidly.
There's your answer, Colonel.
We can't turn back.
We must move forward.
We'll get through.
We must get through.
We'll help you destroy the garrison.
The pulsar weapon belongs to us.
Keep that gun and the Galactica is blown out of the sky.
When news of our revolt reaches a Cylon outpost or base ship, they will come here in their fighters to destroy us.
You will have gone.
We will be here alone and defenceless unless we have the pulsar to repel them.
Can't you hear it?
(Pulsar firing)
The Galactica is the last Colonial battlestar.
The fate of an entire race depends on it!
- That is not our concern.
- But it is mine.
(Gasps)
I am a member of that race that is fleeing the Cylon tyranny.
Father Creator.
It is for our protection that I speak.
We will not be subjugated again by machines.
- We are not perfect...
- But you are human.
More human than I had anticipated.
I shall review my notes to see where I went wrong.
Those are your brothers out there in space.
We have to help them.
Destroy the pulsar.
I will protect you.
- (Apollo) Eight centons to go.
- We go now or not at all.
All the way or not at all.
- We are with you.
- (All) Let's go.
How will you protect them?
I didn't give the Cylons everything I've created.
Five centons.
You take the three at the firing station,
I'll take the two at the door.
For the glory of Caprica.
For once in your life don't be late, Starbuck.
Four centons and closing.
Fire.
Heads up.
Three centons and closing.
(Rigel) Commander, we'll be in range in one centon.
Ready?
NOW!
Let's go!
We're almost out of time!
Croft!
Fire.
That was too close.
Why haven't they stopped it?
- The garrison?
- Wiped out.
You go ahead.
I'll get Croft.
Croft, we've only got a few microns left.
Why would she do that?
Why would she save my life?
Let's go.
Fire.
45 microns and closing.
40 microns, 39...
What if the blast cuts the cable?
We'll find out.
33, 32, 31, 30 microns.
Time to leave, kids.
Let's go!
- My father!
- I'm taking you to him, kid.
(Rigel) 14. 13... (Centurion) Ten... (Rigel) Nine...
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three... (Rigel) Two...
(Centurion) One.
Fire.
Commander, we've picked up an explosion on the surface!
A big one!
Can you read position?
The mountain!
They've done it.
They've done it!
(Cheering)
- Secure quarters!
- Normal operations.
Send out a rescue unit with full fighter escort.
Aye aye, sir.
Baltar, I bring grave news.
- It cannot be.
- I'm afraid it can.
A handful of humans successfully destroyed the Ravashol pulsar.
Despite all of your garrisons and squadrons and the biggest weapon in the universe?
But the strategy was yours, Baltar.
I recommend we come up with a solid front to explain this debacle to the Imperious Leader.
Very well.
But I will yet have the last laugh on Adama, mark my words.
Don't I always, Baltar?
I haven't seen emotion in a long time.
It's good to see it again.
- The Cylons will be back.
- We'll take care of them.
You may have trouble with your children, they're getting more and more human.
I'm glad.
Peace be with you.
May you get to where you're going.
Peace be with you, Father Creator.
- Let's go home!
- (Man) Goodbye!
Good luck!
Let's go home!
Let's go, Starbuck.
Captain, wait.
This is the chance of a lifetime.
Three versions of the same beautiful woman.
- Imagine the possibilities.
- I can.
- You can?
- Yeah.
Another time.
Captain...
Bye .
Well, you win one, lose one.
I just lost all three.

I just have the feeling that we"re being carefully manoeuvred.
We"re being herded into this safe passage ahead.
(Centurion) Pump system to speed.
L"m picking up a flare.
A brilliant bead of light, like an eclipse.
L"m going to check it out.
Locked on target.
Fire.
(Starbuck) "We"re under attack."
Battle stations!
Flight officer!
(Alarm)
Starbuck, they"re forcing me down.
- Is it something serious?
- No.
We"re just handing the fleet over to a bunch of criminals.
There"s not much difference between you and your fellow convicts and us.
We are all live for the promise of freedom and fear the same death.
Cylons.
We"re going down!
Search for wreckage.
Leave no survivors.
They"re clones.
You came to destroy the Ravashol pulsar.
- Ravashol?
- He is the Father Creator.
- Cylon patrol.
- Everybody down.
(Adama) "And now, the exciting conclusion of Gun On Ice Planet Zero."
The way is clear now.
So you"re not turning us in to the Cylons.
No, we hate the Cylons.
We are Theta-class life forms, considered by the Cylons to be subhuman.
We were created for slave labour.
Most of our brothers and sisters are still slaves.
But you revolted.
- Evidently we are not perfect.
- No.
Just human.
Will you help us destroy the pulsar?
First we must get into the village.
Come.
(Muffit barking)
This is the entrance to our underground city.
(Distant chatter)
This leads to the base of the research station.
We must get to the top of that mountain.
- There is one who can help.
- Who?
Father Creator
- Ravashol.
- He"s here?
In the village?
- He lives at the base of Mount Hekla.
- You"ll take me to him?
- To free my people?
Yes.
But first I"ll take your people to safety.
The probe that landed on the planet"s surface - it was destroyed?
Not exactly.
- Not exactly?
- Control yourself, my friend.
You"ll blow a circuit, or I believe you call it a blood vessel.
Quite flimsy compared to...
I do not need a lesson in anatomy.
Where are our fighters?
Close to the point of no return.
Still hectares from the Galactica.
Have them attack the Galactica.
But they will not have enough fuel to return.
That"s suicide.
- They"re machines!
- We are all machines.
Even you, of a sort.
With a probe on the surface and possible survivors,
I must push the Galactica forward.
Even if they were human pilots, I would give the same order.
Yes, I believe you would.
By your command.
(Screams)
- Cylons are searching the village.
- Take the others and hide them.
- But where?
- With the children.
- Hear that, Muffit?
There are children!
- (Barks)
- Children?
- We were thought to be sterile.
It was a Cylon mandate to maintain the purity of the Theta life form.
- But we have been bearing children.
- And hiding them?
Yes.
Father Creator, please do not call for help.
You are not permitted here.
Only planners.
Father Creator, we are in need of your help.
- You"re one of the 5 series.
- Yes.
Series 5, Culture 9.
You are not one of mine.
You"re a human.
Flight Captain Apollo from the Battlestar Galactica.
The Galactica is a vessel of war.
I have no use for war or violence.
You have a strange way of showing it.
What"s that on the mountain, a weapon of peace?
It is an energy lens system to transmit intelligence across the galaxy.
Your energy lens system has fried two of my fighters and is holding the Colonial fleet at bay until the Cylons can destroy it.
Impossible!
My system is maintained by Series 5 Theta life forms.
With all reverence, they are whipped if they come near the pulsar.
You are wrong!
I make adjustments, repairs, I transmit.
My helpers are Series 5!
Right now your pulsar is manned by Cylons as a weapon of war.
A temporary misuse.
A temporary abuse.
So you know how it"s being used!
I have no control over the use of my creations!
- No responsibility!
- Then who does?
(Beep)
"Dr Ravashol, permission to enter."
Cylons!
Behind the research stacks, in the equipment cases.
Hide him!
Enter.
Why did you keep us waiting?
Would you like me to ruin my work?
These are delicate compounds.
- Search.
- What do you think you"re doing?
The garrison commander will hear of this.
- We have orders to search.
- We"ll see about that.
This is Dr Ravashol.
I want to speak to the command Centurion.
"Dr Ravashol."
Why is my work being disrupted?
There is a patrol here.
We are searching for humans.
I know nothing about humans.
Please order your Centurions to go so I may continue my work.
Only planners are permitted to visit you.
He"s here because I need a strong back to move some equipment.
Leave Dr Ravashol to his research.
Punish the worker clone.
He"s here at my orders!
(Woman) Cylons!
Cylons!
Help!
- This is our chance to go.
- We"ve more chance on the mountain.
Why couldn"t you leave us alone?
If you hadn"t come, all would be peaceful!
We had no choice.
The Cylons forced us here.
They are out to exterminate every human in the universe.
- Even you will go.
- They let me live.
They understand my work.
You want to destroy everything I"ve created.
Before you came, everything was in its place.
- Planners to think, workers to work.
- L"ve got news for you.
Your workers are thinking and breeding.
- Impossible.
- Tell that to the children they"ve hidden.
Children?
If you won"t help me to save the lives in the fleet, do it for the Thetas.
In a sense, they"re all your children.
We"ve picked up a Cylon fighter squadron.
- How many?
- An attack phalanx.
- They"re beginning to press.
- Battle stations.
- Order Blue Squadron to patrol the rear.
- (Alarm)
(Rigel) "Vector coordinates coded and transferred.
"Launch Bay Alpha, stand by to launch fighter patrol.
"Launch when ready.
"Enemy approaching.
100 microns and closing."
- Protect the freighters.
- Blue Leader, engage.
Have our fighters engaged the Galactica?
Yes.
But they will not have enough fuel to return.
Break off the attack.
Baltar, I believe my sound sensor mishears you.
I said break off the attack!
It will force Adama to believe... that we are even closer than we are in actuality.
Very clever.
A little hard on our troops but very clever.
By your command.
Why are they withdrawing?
Secure quarters.
They"ll be back in packs like wild animals.
How long until the landing party completes its mission?
Irrelevant.
We must move forward in exactly... 420 centons, whether they"re successful or not.
There are two chambers, one housing the pulsar, the other a small garrison.
The only way to destroy it is to jam or reverse the main pump.
It"s not easy but it can be done.
Here, here and here.
Quick, we must hide these humans.
He won"t hurt you!
He"s just a daggit!
Where"s Thane?
I don"t know, maybe he got separated.
He"s been looking for a chance to make a break.
- We"d better go find him.
- Wait.
Let us do it.
As you can see, strangers are easy to single out here.
Come.
What is your purpose here?
Just visiting.
How many of you are there?
I travel alone.
L"ve always been a little antisocial.
- You are from the Galactica.
- Never heard of it.
The Cylons have captured one of your party.
- L"ll go.
- You"re not going anywhere.
I need you to scale the mountain.
Take me to where they have Thane.
- The Cylons will recognise you.
- Not if I"m dressed like a Theta.
- All this risk for one man?
- He might betray us.
Are you sure it"s Thane you want to save and not the other one?
Who else are you looking for?
Lt"s a pilot I lost.
Just a kid, really.
His name"s Cree.
If he survived, the Cylons will have him.
For his sake, I hope he didn"t.
Take him to a cold cell.
I will examine his cortex later.
No!
No!
No!
How many combat ships in the fleet?
Tough question.
There"s so many.
How many?
Starbuck!
- Where"s Apollo?
- He is with Ravashol.
- Is he safe?
- He is in hiding.
Can Ravashol be trusted?
He saved Ser 5-9 from the Cylons.
- Looks like they caught you.
- Ravashol lied to save me.
I prefer being whipped to being killed.
In my inner pocket there"s a tape coder.
The information you want is recorded in it.
Just press that button.
We"d better get back.
That"s no way to greet a fellow warrior.
I left you in charge.
What happened?
Thane"s dead.
- But he didn"t betray us.
- We got a problem.
- Ravashol says...
- Father Creator helped you?
Yes.
He says our only chance is a simultaneous attack.
One garrison is stationed outside the pulsar, the other on the gun.
You"re in charge of taking the garrison.
- I won"t let you down.
- L"m counting on it.
- Let"s set our timepieces at 200 centons.
- Got it.
We"ll reach the top and start our attack in exactly 200 centons.
The Galactica will be moving forward after that.
- For all our sakes, don"t be late.
- L"ll be there.
One of the clones told me the Cylon fighters are located at the top of the mountain, just behind the pulsar emplacement.
When we get there, we grab one!
And go where?
How long before Galactica hunts us down?
The Galactica is the hunted.
Adama won"t waste a squadron hunting down three ex-convicts.
He knows that!
Why are your sympathies with those who chained you?
The Galactica and the entire fleet are finished.
They will be if we don"t knock out that pulsar.
Right.
They"ll all be destroyed and we"ll be free!
We can find another planet.
Starlos isn"t far.
We can pick up food and water and fuel.
Are you with us, or are you going to turn your back on freedom again?
I could not shoot down a Colonial warrior.
Oh, yes, I know - the code, the bloodline.
And for all your compassion, they chained you like an animal!
Now is your chance!
Our chance.
One last time, my husband.
Are you with us?
L"m with you.
Good news.
Some of our fighters may have enough fuel to rendezvous with us.
Well, at least 30%.
Good.
Have them re-engage the Galactica.
But Baltar, they just disengaged.
Yes!
It will drive Adama crazy.
- He"s not the only one.
- You said something?
By your command.
(Rigel) Enemy closing. 10 microns.
- (Adama) General quarters.
- Closing in, five microns.
(Rigel) Blue Squadron up.
Launch when ready.
Activate the laser turrets.
(Radio chatter)
Cylon attacking fighters have retreated but Cylon battlestars are entering the quadrant.
Our time is up, Colonel.
Flank speed ahead!
We"re going right through.
By your command.
"Our base ships have arrived and are closing on the Galactica.
"What is the status of the pulsar?"
- Fully operative.
- "Initiate random firing.
"Sweep the entire corridor.
Begin at once."
By your command.
Notify summit station.
Random sweeps covering the corridor.
(Alarm blaring)
Lens system aligned.
Pulsar ready to fire.
Commence firing.
(Adama) My God.
(Operator) Yes, I read you.
Fire.
Avalanche!
(Groaning)
That"s one I owe you.
(Pulsar firing)
His leg - he"ll never make it to the top of the mountain.
- Can you get him down?
- I think so.
- Do it!
- What about the pulsar?
We"ll take it from here.
Let"s go!
We"ve only got 80 centons left!
Fire.
(Omega) We"re getting within range.
The expedition must have failed.
They still have 70 centons.
Fire.
(Rigel) lt"s closing. 68 centons.
If we"re gonna go... it"s got to be now!
(Pulsar firing)
L"m with you.
There"s nowhere you can go, Wolfe!
There"s a squadron of Cylon fighters the other side of the hill.
We"re getting off this piece of ice.
There isn"t time!
The Galactica"s passing through the quadrant!
- We"ve got to silence that gun!
- I don"t care about the Galactica.
The Galactica is the only ship in the galaxy that can protect you.
Without us you"re finished!
I don"t think you realise who is finished here.
The Cylons won"t rest until we"re all dead.
Don"t worry, Captain, we"re gonna make it.
- To where?
- Well, now... that isn"t really going to matter... to you.
Wolfe!
(Apollo) Don"t shoot!
He"ll never make it.
He"s not getting away, he"s as good as dead.
We"ve got to go with him.
It"s our only chance.
We"re here on a mission - a mission to save the last remains of a once-civilised race.
And we"re going to do it!
You understand that?
This mission goes through.
- (Pulsar fires)
- Let"s get moving.
Time is running out.
L"m putting you in charge.
Get us into that pulsar station.
We"ve only got 62 centons.
We"re approaching Cylon scanning range.
They"ll have a fix on us at any moment.
Commander...
I suggest we let all the ships move at maximum speed.
We jeopardise the fleet if we maintain the speed of the slowest ship.
Execute.
Galactica to all ships.
Accelerate to maximum possible speed.
Increase interval spacing.
And good luck.
Where is the Galactica?
60 centons and closing.
50 centons and closing.
Maintain random firing.
Fire.
Hard to starboard.
42 centons.
L"ll be with you as fast as I can.
- Where you going?
- To settle a debt.
- You"re going to what?
- Don"t wait more than 20 centons.
This is the intake for the cooling system.
Laser"s inside.
We don"t have enough solenite to blow it all up.
Ravashol said the key element is the energy exchange pump.
If we can wreck it, the gun will overload and blow itself up.
Let"s take a look.
We"ve only got 35 centons to go.
I hope Starbuck"s on schedule.
The emergency escape hatch.
The cold cells where the Cylons hold prisoners are directly below.
- There"ll be guards.
- It"ll take"em by surprise.
Nobody breaks into prison.
- Starbuck!
- Can you walk?
- I can try.
- Let"s go.
- Where is the Galactica?
- 30 centons and closing.
Fire.
- Hard to port.
- Helm hard to port.
- That was close.
- Hard to starboard.
Commander, we have to turn back.
We"ll never make it.
(Rigel) 27 centons and closing.
Hold on!
They"re using the intakes!
(Wind rushing)
Let"s go!
Hurry up, we"ve only got 25 centons.
Come on.
In here.
Wait.
Listen...
- You risked your life to save his.
- Seemed like a good trade then.
You are very courageous.
I don"t wish to betray my people but...
But what?
- They will help you destroy the Cylons.
- I know.
They will not allow you to destroy the pulsar.
How will they stop us?
Apollo and the others are setting the charges.
I do not know how, only that they will - by whatever means.
Let"s talk to your people.
That"s the firing station in the middle.
It controls the energy pump.
- Is that the target?
- Blow that and it overloads.
It"ll blow off the top of the mountain.
20 centons.
Fire.
- Increase spacing between ships.
- Yes, sir.
Cylon base stars, quadrant Epsilon.
Closing rapidly.
There"s your answer, Colonel.
We can"t turn back.
We must move forward.
We"ll get through.
We must get through.
We"ll help you destroy the garrison.
The pulsar weapon belongs to us.
Keep that gun and the Galactica is blown out of the sky.
When news of our revolt reaches a Cylon outpost or base ship, they will come here in their fighters to destroy us.
You will have gone.
We will be here alone and defenceless unless we have the pulsar to repel them.
Can"t you hear it?
(Pulsar firing)
The Galactica is the last Colonial battlestar.
The fate of an entire race depends on it!
- That is not our concern.
- But it is mine.
(Gasps)
I am a member of that race that is fleeing the Cylon tyranny.
Father Creator.
It is for our protection that I speak.
We will not be subjugated again by machines.
- We are not perfect...
- But you are human.
More human than I had anticipated.
I shall review my notes to see where I went wrong.
Those are your brothers out there in space.
We have to help them.
Destroy the pulsar.
I will protect you.
- (Apollo) Eight centons to go.
- We go now or not at all.
All the way or not at all.
- We are with you.
- (All) Let"s go.
How will you protect them?
I didn"t give the Cylons everything I"ve created.
Five centons.
You take the three at the firing station, I"ll take the two at the door.
For the glory of Caprica.
For once in your life don"t be late, Starbuck.
Four centons and closing.
Fire.
Heads up.
Three centons and closing.
(Rigel) Commander, we"ll be in range in one centon.
Ready?
Now!
Let"s go!
We"re almost out of time!
Croft!
Fire.
That was too close.
Why haven"t they stopped it?
- The garrison?
- Wiped out.
You go ahead.
L"ll get Croft.
Croft, we"ve only got a few microns left.
Why would she do that?
Why would she save my life?
Let"s go.
Fire.
45 microns and closing.
40 microns, 39...
What if the blast cuts the cable?
We"ll find out.
33, 32, 31, 30 microns.
Time to leave, kids.
Let"s go!
- My father!
- L"m taking you to him, kid.
(Rigel) 14, 13... (Centurion) Ten... (Rigel) Nine...
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three... (Rigel) Two...
(Centurion) One.
Fire.
Commander, we"ve picked up an explosion on the surface!
A big one!
Can you read position?
The mountain!
They"ve done it.
They"ve done it!
(Cheering)
- Secure quarters!
- Normal operations.
Send out a rescue unit with full fighter escort.
Aye aye, sir.
Baltar, I bring grave news.
- It cannot be.
- L"m afraid it can.
A handful of humans successfully destroyed the Ravashol pulsar.
Despite all of your garrisons and squadrons and the biggest weapon in the universe?
But the strategy was yours, Baltar.
I recommend we come up with a solid front to explain this debacle to the imperious Leader.
Very well.
But I will yet have the last laugh on Adama, mark my words.
Don"t I always, Baltar?
I haven"t seen emotion in a long time.
It"s good to see it again.
- The Cylons will be back.
- We"ll take care of them.
You may have trouble with your children, they"re getting more and more human.
L"m glad.
Peace be with you.
May you get to where you"re going.
Peace be with you, Father Creator.
- Let"s go home!
- (Man) Goodbye!
Good luck!
Let"s go home!
Let"s go, Starbuck.
Captain, wait.
This is the chance of a lifetime.
Three versions of the same beautiful woman.
- Imagine the possibilities.
- I can.
- You can?
- Yeah.
Another time.
Captain...
Bye.
Well, you win one, lose one.
I just lost all three.
(Adama) "Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny,
"the last battlestar, Galactica,
"leads a ragtag fugitive fleet
"on a lonely quest -
"a shining planet

What do you want in return for the energiser?
I want you.
What did you promise her in return for that energiser?
- Two agro ships are destroyed.
- The third?
(Tigh) She suffered heavy damage.
Lost her airlock.
(Apollo) Father.
(Adama) The Borays are coming.
You are in as much danger as we are.
"There are those who believe

"Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man

Prepare to attack Colonial warriors.
- How many got by our intercept?
- (Boomer) "I counted six."
Hopefully the Galactica will get them before they do much damage.
(Apollo) "This is Blue Leader, come in Galactica."
This is Galactica, Blue Leader.
Put on your bracers and hang on.
A few of them got through.
- Order red alert.
- Yes, sir.
(Alarm)
Notify all ships in the fleet to expect imminent attack from unknown number of Cylons.
Greenbean, form on me.
There"s a pair after the agro ships on the perimeter.
You would worry about that.
Hit those, you"ll have nothing to eat.
(Jolly) "That isn"t funny, Greenbean.
Hurry."
Commander, Cylons withdrawing.
- All but two destroyed.
- All right.
- Cancel red alert.
- Yes, sir.
- Damage report.
- You aren"t going to like it.
- Two agro ships are destroyed.
- The third?
She suffered heavy damage.
Lost her airlock.
That"s repairable.
It"s just like you see.
When we lost our airlock, we lost our crop.
We won"t be able to force-grow enough to feed our planters, let alone anyone else in the fleet.
OK, we"ve fixed the airlock.
Do you need more planters, more nutrients?
Whatever you need, you"ve got it.
- We need new seed.
- New seed?
New seed.
Yes, I know, Colonel, but it"s not a complete disaster.
That small planet our advance patrol discovered
- in that quadrant nearby...
- Yes?
It appears there"s a small human agricultural settlement there.
- That"s too good to be true.
- L"ve asked Apollo to get an energiser from one of the older ships.
- I don"t think I follow.
- The point is, there isn"t an outpost in the star system that doesn"t need more power to sustain life.
I figure we get an old energiser to trade for new seeds.
That"s easy.
We have energisers all over this battlestar.
They run everything.
But they have Colonial markings.
What we need is an old energiser with no markings.
No one will know who we are and no one can sell us out to the Cylons.
- (Door bleeping)
- Enter.
Apollo.
Did you find an energiser that might fit the bill?
- Er, yes.
- Good.
- It was made on Orion.
- Excellent!
Perfect.
No one would know it"s Colonial.
- Er...
- What"s the matter?
The woman who owns it doesn"t want to give it up.
- The woman?
- Siress Belloby.
Well, we"ll just have to appropriate Siress Belloby"s energiser
- and get it to the planet.
- She"s not willing to give it up.
Captain, to save every man, woman and child from starvation,
- we"ll have to talk to her.
- That"s exactly what she said.
Only she wants Commander Adama to talk to her.
What"s the problem?
Just order her to give it up.
You don"t understand, Tigh.
No one orders Siress Belloby to do anything.
(Apollo) "Shuttle requesting permission to dock with Gemini freighter."
- This won"t work.
- This isn"t something you can avoid.
- Apollo, you go and you charm her.
- Oh, no.
(Woman) Come in, Adama.
All right.
Let"s go in.
After you.
To think I would have the honour of having the great Commander Adama visit me in my humble little dwellings.
The pleasure is mine, Belloby.
Then please, sit down.
- Thank you.
- It"s been a long, long time.
Flowers?
For me?
Oh, I thought this was a business call.
A man can always take the time to recognise the... beauties of life.
Oh, you must need that energiser so badly.
Sit.
All right, then, let"s negotiate.
What do you want in return for the energiser?
Oh, Adama...
After all these years, I think that should be obvious.
I want you.
(Apollo) There"s no reason for you to go.
I have been cooped up on this ship for 16 quatrons.
L"m going on this mission and we are now in range.
You"re desperately needed here.
Apollo, if we don"t have seeds, we don"t have food.
If we don"t have food, we will all perish.
So please stop making objections and get the launch ready with provisions for five.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Wait a minute.
You, me, Starbuck, Boomer... that makes four of us.
Siress Belloby will be going with us.
Siress Belloby on a mission?
Uh, Father... what did you have to promise her in return for that energiser?
I made a promise to court her.
I did not specify when or where and I certainly will not embarrass you.
So let"s stop this talking, get on with it, get it over with, because we must have those seeds!
(Tigh) The planet Sectar.
Stand by to launch mission.
- (Muffit barks)
- You"re leaving me alone again?
Er, Boxey, I"m a warrior.
Sometimes I must go on missions to places unsafe for a little boy.
Aren"t you just going for fresh seeds?
Yeah, but there"s...
You know something?
You"re right.
It"s not dangerous.
If Siress Belloby can go, why not you?
- Right?
- And Muffy?
- (Barks)
- Of course, Muffy.
- Yeah!
Yeah!
- (Barks)
Standing by to launch.
All functions transferred to shuttle.
Launch.
An adventure to a distant star.
Oh, isn"t it downright romantic?
(Adama) "As important as our quest for seed,
"the planet our scouts located
"supports a small band of human inhabitants -
"perhaps the remnants of pioneers
"who set out yahrens ago from our own Colonies.
"Even more hopefully, they might be descendants of the 13th tribe,
"those elusive brothers of man who might lead us to the planet Earth."
(Music and chatter)
(Woman laughing raucously)
Oh, God!
The moon is up!
The lights.
(Thunder of hooves)
Farnes, I hate to tell you but... it"s time.
As if I didn"t know.
You can feel the whole herd coming at us.
A lot of good this"ll do.
Wouldn"t stop a hedge-hopper.
They"re herd creatures.
Your mere presence"ll stop them from pillaging.
It"s their way.
All you have to do is stand out there.
- Make a show of force.
- Is that what the last constable did?
The one before him?
The one before him?
If there"s one thing this town despises more than the Borays, it"s cowardice.
Once a man accepts that badge...
I know, I know.
He"s got it for life.
However long that is.
Well, let"s get this over with.
(Snorting)
(Screeching)
(Snorting)
(Thunder of hooves fades)
(Man) They got him.
(Woman) Did they get him?
(Man) They got him.
(Woman) Oh, no.
Poor Constable Farnes.
- He was one of the best we ever had.
- Yeah.
I don"t suppose there are... any volunteers to take Farnes" place?
(Woman) Don"t do it.
No, no.
You may as well save your breath.
Nobody in his right mind is gonna accept that badge.
L"m afraid you"re right, Dipper.
We"ll just have to hope and pray that another drifter passes through Serenity before the next high moon.
I sure wish I could go with you, Boomer.
I could use a little diversion.
I hear you guys spotted some lady types on the settlement...
There were a few...
Muffy wanted to know if they had any other daggits around.
We"re going to make that a priority probe as soon as Apollo and I get to the settlement.
The energiser seems well secured.
Let the younger men worry about the energiser.
This is a time for intoxicating scenery, unfiltered air and letting our emotions soar and...
- Ahem.
I hate to interrupt...
- No, no, that"s all right.
Boomer and I are ready to go.
No, I want you to stay here.
You"ve spent little enough time with Boxey and me.
Let them get on with their mission.
I guess you heard him!
Get in the sled and get going.
I was hoping we might have had a chance to be alone.
Well, we must be very careful not to lose our way of getting off this planet.
If anything happened to our ship, that would be the end of everything.
You mean we"d have to...
You mean we"d have to spend the rest of our lives on this quaint little planet?
- Oh!
Just the two of us?
- Ah, well...
- (Engine starts)
- Back before you know it.
- See that you are.
- Good luck!
(Muffit barks)
Well, at least we have this time alone.
Belloby, please, not in front of the children.
Looks like the only place that"s open, Boomer.
(# Barrel organ music from within)
It doesn"t sound like the sort of place one goes to trade an energiser for seed.
Well, we gotta start asking questions someplace.
Looks like another full moon tonight, Dipper.
Don"t look at me.
Unless we find a down-on-his-luck prospector or some poor unwitting strangers, we are just out of luck.
Boomer, we"re in luck.
This is my kind of town.
Well, well...
What have we here?
Er, excuse me.
They told us you"re the man to see.
That depends.
- My name"s Bogan.
- Starbuck.
This is my friend Boomer.
We"re looking for someone to talk to about an agron purchase.
- You boys farmers?
- Er, yep.
Er, my father and I run a forced nitron field in the next quadrant and... we"ve suffered some reversals.
- That right?
- Blight.
And we need some fresh seed grain.
And we couldn"t help noticing your bins are brimming full.
We were hoping for the possibility of a trade-off.
That"s an interesting idea.
A couple of strong young fellas like you would fit in with our needs.
No, we weren"t talking about us.
We"re talking about an energiser.
- How much power?
- 5,000 kilons.
- 5,000 kilons...
- I don"t think that"d fit into our plans.
But practically every outpost in this star system is always crying for more power.
Really?
That gives you a lot of places to make deals in, huh?
Well, that"s it?
We can"t even talk about it, sir?
Why not take a look at her?
She"s got a clean, steady current.
L"m sorry, fellas.
L"d like to help you.
If you want to discuss staying on, doing a job in exchange for seed... I"m sorry, we haven"t got time.
Our crops are in trouble!
Maybe some other time, then.
Right.
Thanks anyway.
You know we could use that power.
We need those two boys even more.
- Now we don"t have either one.
- Wrong.
Now we have both.
What will we tell Adama?
What will we tell the people at the fleet when they hear we couldn"t get seed for food?
Hey, what the...
Frack!
Larcenous, golmonging thieves!
- What is this?
- Lousy golmonging thieves!
Frack!
What the...
Lousy golmonging thieves!
You dirty, rotten crasoneys!
Come back here and fight!
Will you cut the felgercarb and give me a hand?
Of all the stupid...
No point talking about it.
We got a long walk ahead.
- It"s not that far back to town.
- Town?
We"ve gotta go tell the Commander.
Do that.
L"m going to look for the energiser.
I have a pretty good idea who sent them.
- Bogan.
- Uh-huh.
Bogan.
Why buy the energiser when you can steal it?
- You got it!
- Take care.
Well, Dipper, nice work.
Here"s 25 quantums for you and for each of your friends.
Thank you, Sire.
I want you to know that we were very, very careful not to leave any tracks to lead them back here.
- Good.
- Excuse me.
Well, stranger.
- Welcome back.
- That"s real hospitable talk, Bogan, but somebody here isn"t so neighbourly.
You haven"t noticed anybody come in in the last couple of microns?
People come and go around here.
What"s your trouble?
- Robbers.
- Not in Serenity.
Close enough to make it a sure bet it was one of your nice local folk.
That"s a serious accusation, young man.
L"ll back it up, in time.
You"ll have to excuse me.
I have a game waiting.
Where"s your local law enforcement?
The town constable has... moved on.
- Who"s taking his place?
- The job hasn"t been filled yet.
I can tell from your expression what you"re thinking.
L"d be careful about taking the law in my own hands without suitable authority.
The people...
The people around here stick together and they don"t like people who don"t have a stake in our problems.
If you were willing to stay on for just a while, work, fit in...
I have crops to get back to, people to feed!
But you said that your crops were blighted and that you needed seed.
Have you got the money to pay for the seed?
I have some currency I got a yahren ago when we sold our last crop.
Ah.
Well...
Orion checks,
Colonial cubits...
You got a bit of everything.
Ah...
Yeah, well...
Seed goes for 12 quantums a lexon.
- How much you need?
- At least a thousand lexons.
And 12 quantums is kinda high.
Well, it is a long way to the next agron outpost.
Maybe I can get this currency to grow a little.
After all, this is a chancery.
- Shouldn"t they be back by now?
- I should"ve gone.
I scouted the mission.
- It was important that you stay.
- To protect the camp?
- Yes.
- Against what?
- Robbers.
- Oh, Boomer!
Thank the Lords of Kobol you"re all right.
- Where"s Starbuck?
- He"s fine.
- Where"s the seed?
- No seed.
- No seed?
- Where"s the powersled?
- It"s gone.
- Gone?
- What about the energiser?
- We lost that, too.
You lost my energiser?
- We were jumped.
- By whom?
It happened so fast.
We think it was a bunch from town.
Of all the...
Look, lady, I"d like to see you do any better unarmed with a net over you.
Boomer, I"m sure you both did whatever you could but now we must get to Starbuck.
There"s no telling what he"s up against.
Jolly, you stay here, guard the shuttle... take care of Boxey and let"s take our lasers with us.
A three-level pyramid.
Cry your hearts out.
I ain"t never seen a three-level pyramid.
- That does it for me.
- Now...
I find it very odd that one person can be so lucky.
Another odd thing is how you each had the same amount of currency to lose.
You all work together someplace?
All farmer workmen here earn uniform compensation.
25 quantums.
That"s good pay for farm work.
I told you you might like some employment here.
Oh.
Looks to me like you"re still a little short of buying that seed.
Bogan, maybe you"d care to play with me head to head, as you seem to be the man to beat?
All right, Starbuck.
Sounds like a good challenge.
(Grunting)
There it is, Bogan.
Put up or give up.
I seem to be a little shy here.
I...
Tell you what, I"ll challenge.
If you agree to accept this as payment.
- What"s this?
- A shield made of solid gold.
It belonged to a fella who"s gone now.
What"s this writing here say?
I...
Yes, the ancient tongue of the people who first colonised this planet.
They"ve moved on across the star system.
It feels right.
Excuse me.
A fella can"t be too careful away from home.
I wondered how he would get him to accept that badge.
You mean, he"s gonna let him win it?
It doesn"t matter how it comes into your possession.
Once you accept it, you accept all that goes with it.
This is what you get when you send boys to do men"s work.
Belloby, please keep your voice down.
Those boys know exactly what they"re doing.
If you kiss me, I"ll tell you where the powersled is.
- What?
- Well... do you want our people to starve?
Belloby... if this is some kind of a joke, it"s a bad one.
You"re right, Adama.
Think of it as a small celebration for finding the energiser.
L"m sorry I had to force you to do it.
But you know something?
It was worth it.
Oh, Belloby...
Bargaining isn"t... begging.
L"m very glad we had this time, too.
But that time is running out.
Where is the energiser?
- You"re practically standing on it.
- Hm?
I found the streaks from the powersled and they led right up to that old shed over there.
Belloby!
Well, I...
- I guess this is all mine.
- Yes.
- Congratulations, Constable.
- The name"s Starbuck.
Congratulations, Constable Starbuck.
I don"t think I...
Who"s in charge here, please?
Sire Bogan.
- Sire Bogan?
- That"s right.
L"m Squire Adama, Lord of Bellarium.
Who"s in charge of law and order?
Ah, well.
There he is.
You"re looking at him.
There"s your man.
Constable Starbuck.
How do you get into these fixes?
I was trying to find the guys that robbed us.
And you expected to find them at a card game.
Where else?
My number one suspect was in a card game.
I thought I could catch him with his guard down.
And what did you get out of it?
A badge you can"t afford to wear, a loss of time and the loss of perhaps innumerable people.
Ah.
I see you"ve moved in.
Excellent.
There"s little time.
The moon is almost full.
Sire Bogan.
You appear to be a reasonable man.
- I like to think so.
- Good.
Because we can ill afford to lose even one valuable man.
- A mere boy.
- I can sympathise with that.
- We have the same problem.
- Then you"ll let him resign.
Can"t do that.
It"s against the law.
No, Constable is a lifetime appointment.
(Adama) That"s absurd!
I mean, you don"t even know this boy!
And he was never appointed!
He accepted the badge of office.
As for knowing him... you seem like nice people, you want him back so bad, he"s got to be all right.
If Constable is a lifetime commitment, how is it you"re without one?
- Didn"t you say the last one left town?
- I said he departed.
I didn"t say to where.
Fact is, he died in office.
After a lifetime of service to his people.
An eminently respectable position.
Half the people in town would cherish it.
- Half the people in town have had it.
- That"s impossible.
You"re contradicting yourself.
If you can"t resign and half the people have held the office...
- Not the half that"s still alive.
- Beg your pardon?
All right, look.
You might as well know.
We are an endangered species here.
Ever since the Borays saw it was easier to steal food than grow their own, we"ve been losing our lives.
Why don"t you get rid of the odorous vermin?
(Scoffing) That"s easier said than done.
We"re not well armed here.
If the Borays weren"t herd creatures, who follow their leader Nogow no matter what, we"d all be dead.
They follow their leader no matter what?
We leave our food bins unprotected, they head for them and they rob us, unmolested.
If any of them get the idea of riding into town for a drink or, shall we say, companionship, our constable stands at the head of the street and he heads them off with a few carefully placed shots.
So when the leader turns away, the others follow him.
Then one or two Borays ride past him and they grab a couple of our females but... mostly we just lose a little grain.
And, of course, the constable.
I...
I don"t feel so well.
Don"t you worry now.
Don"t you worry.
We won"t allow you to jeopardise your life for them.
They know perfectly well that they...
they tricked you into this job.
My dear sir,
I am afraid you don"t understand the situation.
You are in as much danger as we are as long as you"re here.
And there isn"t much time.
- What do you mean by that?
- You know the Borays.
When the moon is full, it"s time to eat.
Father, come with me.
You, too, Constable, since you"re the law in this town.
(Clattering)
Look, Belloby.
Get back in the jail.
Find a cell and hide in some dark corner.
I will not cower on the floor like some infant daggit.
Do as you"re told.
It"s an order!
We"ll make our stand at the edge of town.
(Snorting and roaring)
(Thunder of hooves)
(Apollo) Here they come.
Holy frack, they could shake us to death.
Fire in front of them.
Now!
- (Apollo) They"re still coming!
- Now what?
Take cover!
(Screeches)
L"m not gonna stand here and let Adama handle them all alone.
OK.
Aaaah!
Sire Bogan!
Sire Bogan!
Sire Bogan!
- They"ve captured our woman.
- Oh, Lord, no.
They got Belloby?
You"re not ordinary farmers.
There"s only one legendary brigade in the whole universe that could"ve matched the courage I just witnessed.
L"m honoured to be in the presence of warriors from the great Colonies.
Look, I have to apologise for deceiving you into saving our town but we"re desperate people here.
Anyway... you"re not like us.
You know what you have to do and I salute you for it.
Any communication from the surface yet?
No, sir.
No word as yet.
The Commander should have gotten that seed by now.
The path that we"ve indicated to you is the only one we know leading into the Boray Canyon.
Unfortunately, we can"t describe to you how to find their camp.
That"s right.
No one"s ever made it back to tell us.
- You may need these.
- We won"t have any trouble.
Come here, Muffy.
Come here.
Sorry to have to borrow you but we need your tracking sensors.
Our prayers go with you.
And to the woman you love.
(Clears throat) Much obliged.
They"ve seen their last days.
They"ll never be back.
Hope they make it, Dipper.
They"re brave men.
Bogan says the Borays do a lot of carrying on and chanting after a raiding party.
That"ll be a help.
Muffy, find Belloby.
Find Belloby.
(Barks)
We"re being watched.
(Adama) Yes, I know.
We have been for some time now.
(Barks)
Get the torches.
(Barks)
Nogow, their leader, seems to be the key.
If we get him to listen to us, the rest might follow him.
Yes, he"s the one, all right.
If he weren"t so lazy, the Borays wouldn"t be stealing their food.
Commander.
They let us come this far.
Maybe they want to avoid a confrontation.
Father.
It looks like it"s all over but I"m not going down without a fight.
(Grunting)
You remain here.
- Father...
- It"s all right.
(Grunting)
Talk?
(Grunts)
Adama?
Oh, thank God!
What courage.
What love you must have to come and deliver me.
Belloby...
Look...
You love your people.
I love my people.
(Snorting)
What"s going on in there?
No one"s a better diplomat than your father.
If anyone can make them understand, it"s...
That is the most obstinate, self-centred, opportunistic, selfish, lazy creature I"ve ever met in my life.
He"s interested in one thing only - his own personal comforts.
You can"t bargain with such a creature.
- Commander?
- What?
Did you say lazy, self-serving, interested in his own pleasure?
- Exactly.
- Could I speak to you, please?
- In private.
- All right, make it quick.
(Snorting)
We"ve got nothing to lose.
No, we don"t have anything to lose.
Starbuck, where...
- Father, what was that all about?
- He"s got a plan.
It"s a long shot but it"s the best plan we have.
- Commander?
- They"re working up to a charge.
Apollo, fire a warning round.
(Grunting)
Belloby...
Let"s get away while the getting is good.
(Muffit barks)
Well, this"ll... this"ll entitle you to all the fresh planting seed that your ship will hold.
We"ll help you load so you can be off.
Our people will be very grateful.
We have many to feed.
L"ll speak to the town committee about altering the charter.
That is, pertaining to the job of constable being a lifetime job.
- Thank you.
- We"ll just keep on hiding and dying.
Perhaps not.
Is Starbuck back yet?
(Knocking) Yo!
Bogan.
Commander.
Good news.
There will be no further raids on your food.
The Borays will go back to raising their own just like they used to.
Your young man has had too much celebration.
No, I... I"ve worked out a nice arrangement with my buddy Nogow.
My dear young, young man, it"s Nogow who"s the heart of our problem.
He"s the good-for-nothing leader that"s turned them into scavengers.
That"s right.
That"s him.
You see, what I proposed is a little trade-out.
You make sure he gets all the grain and libation he needs, without ever having to lift a finger or mount a steed, and in return he"s willing to... take over.
Take over?
What?
The town, of course!
No...
My job.
- Nogow.
- (Grunting)
No, nothing to worry about.
L"d like you all to meet Serenity"s new constable,
Constable Nogow.
Somebody buy him a drink.
He doesn"t like to be kept waiting.
Right this way, Constable Nogow.
I knew someday your poor character would come in handy.
If only I were a few yahrens younger.
(Belloby) And you!
If it were up to that diplomatic bilge you tried, I"d still be in his clutches, which might not have been a bad idea.
Listen, I"m sorry, but I"m afraid we"ve grown in different directions.
You"re too refined and dignified.
I need somebody at my stage of life...
I need a real animal.
Come on, boys, I"m buying.
Thank the Lord.
I just couldn"t see myself calling her Mother.
(Adama) "Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny,
"the last battlestar, Galactica,
"leads a ragtag fugitive fleet
"on a lonely quest -
"a shining planet
"known as Earth."
(Boomer) "Starbuck crash-landed.
A planet on the edge of Omega Sector."
- At least we don"t rust.
- Silence.
- Kyle?
- My brother.
He"s our leader.
He"s only a boy and the others were just children.
We trade Starbuck to the tin cans for Father.
And I just wanted to thank you.
We don"t have your father yet but... you"re welcome.
"There are those who believe
"that life here
"began out there,
"far across the universe,
"with tribes of humans
"who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians
"or the Toltecs or the Mayans.
"Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man
"who even now fight to survive
"somewhere beyond the heavens."
Boomer, I just reached a big decision.
- You should be the first to know.
- Only the two of us out here.
See that red star 40 degrees to port?
I gotcha.
What"s the big decision?
I was just staring at it and the words of my old flight instructor came back to me.
"Starbuck, a viper pilot only flies three vipers -
"the one he trains in, the one he escapes from... (Sighs) "and the one he dies in."
(Bleeping)
Starbuck, the scanner.
- (Boomer) "They"re on our tail!"
- Let"s show"em our nose.
- They"re running.
- "Yeah, not for long."
"One in your blind spot!"
- Starbuck, you OK?
- L"ll tell you if you tell me how bad it is.
And give it to me straight.
No lies.
It"s all hanging out to dry.
I don"t know how you can transmit.
Everything back of your anti-burn baffles is gone.
Everything forward isn"t exactly tiptop.
L"m trying to find you a place to land.
All I can do is fly straight ahead.
And I"m not too sure about that.
"Afraid my instructor was right."
"Get going before you run out of fuel."
Sticking with me is a bad bet.
L"ve got it.
A Delta class planet.
It"s dead ahead.
- "Get going."
- Not till I know you"re down.
If I don"t make it, you"ll be the first to know, I promise.
L"ll be back with a clean uniform before you know it.
L"ll be seeing you.
I hope.
When you"re finished, move the petro dump inside the moat, under the protection of our outer walls.
By your command.
Canus Patrol has intercepted two Colonial viper craft.
Colonial vipers.
Well, well.
One viper running.
The second is crippled and has penetrated the atmosphere.
We are tracking him.
Order our patrol to return.
- "Canus flight leader, return to base."
- Returning.
What if the Colonial warrior evades our patrol?
Lmpossible.
(Chuckling wickedly)
Aah.
Attila garrison commander reporting.
- Attila?
- An obscure outpost in the Omega Sector.
The commander"s name is Specter, I believe.
One of the earlier IL series.
Before my time.
Rather limited in ability.
Report, Specter.
"We have apprehended a Colonial warrior."
Excellent.
Have you interrogated the pilot?
"The scouting party that captured him has not yet returned to our garrison."
I think you know what I desire.
"The exact position of the Galactica."
I shall await your next communication.
You have a wonderful opportunity here, Specter.
- Use it well.
- By your command.
This Specter seems to have done rather well...
- for an early model.
- Hmm...
(Starbuck) Aaah!
Hey!
Aaah.
Take it easy, would you?
These humanoids are not well constructed.
They damage easily.
- At least we don"t rust.
- Silence.
(Horn sounds)
Aaah.
Welcome to Attila, Lieutenant.
- You can"t come in here.
- It"s important.
Stop whispering.
L"m not asleep.
Now you"ve done it.
Good to see you looking better, sir.
I don"t look better.
I look awful.
- But I feel better.
- But you won"t for long if you don"t get some sleep.
With that doorway guarded like the gateway to Kobol,
I presume something important has happened.
The recon patrol?
As you felt, the Cylons have penetrated more deeply than we expected.
Our patrol was ambushed.
- And?
- Starbuck had to crash-land.
- But he did land?
- Yes.
- Where?
- Attila.
It"s a planet on the far edge of Omega Sector.
Bad news all around.
Recommendation?
Sending a squadron would draw too much attention.
- What, then?
A shuttle?
- In and out fast.
It better be fast.
If it"s not back within 24 centares it"ll never catch up with us.
- You and Boomer?
- Yes, sir.
(Grunting with pain)
Please, please, try... try not to move.
You have been hurt.
- There were others.
- My brothers and sister.
- And Cylons.
- Don"t worry.
We can handle them.
Kyle is very, very smart.
- Kyle?
- My brother.
He"s our leader.
Leader?
But he"s only a boy and the others were just children.
We are not children.
We are warriors.
Miri, prepare some food.
- The others will soon return from patrol.
- Patrol?
Those boys and that little girl out there with Cylons?
- Do you realise what can happen?
- They saw their mother killed, watched the tin cans pillage and invade our castle, slaughter our people.
What can happen to them?
They could be killed or captured.
We are too swift, our attacks too precise, too well timed, too well planned.
- You attack them?
- They are the enemy.
They took all we ever had.
So now we hurt them.
We attack their ammunition depots, fuel dumps and patrols.
Yeah.
Thanks for that.
We fight a common foe.
You"re from the Galactica, correct?
You know of the Galactica?
We learned of the Galactica from the Cylons.
How far away is she?
- Too far.
It"ll be a while before a rescue party can get here for me.
L"m afraid you"re stuck with me for a bit.
Tin cans are following the tracks I laid!
Corporal, is this the way you report?
A buncha tin cans, sir, following the tracks I... you ordered me to make in Naga Forest.
Very good.
At ease.
Now, get some nourishment.
We"re a little short on discipline at times but you won"t find better warriors.
Who taught you?
Your father?
- Father was our leader until...
- Until the Cylons killed him!
Miri, feed the lieutenant.
And be quick.
We have a mission.
Robus, Nilz, Ariadne, go get your tablets.
Oh, Miri.
We want to talk to the warrior.
After you eat and study.
That smells good.
I didn"t realise I was so hungry.
- You"re also their teacher?
- Their education is very important.
I always wanted to meet a woman as long on brains as beauty.
You think I"m pretty?
Oh, Miri...
Eat!
Miri, when you get back to the Galactica, you"ll have every viper pilot battling over you.
- You"ll drive them crazy.
- Back to the Galactica?
Yes.
You can"t stay here.
When the rescue team from the fleet comes for me you"ll come with us.
All of us?
Of course, all of you.
We have a mission.
Boxey.
Oh, it"s good to see you.
How did you get past the guard?
- I snuck right by her.
- You snuck right by her?
You"re the first.
You"d better get under the blankets just in case she decides to sneak in, too.
L"ve got somebody to talk to.
Shall I tell you a story, like you do when I"m in sickbed?
Oh, that would be nice.
There once was a shiny planet...
Called Earth.
No, called Mushieland.
Mushieland?
And it was full of daggits - orange daggits, blue daggits, daggits with horns, daggits with curly tails.
The best daggit of them all was Sire Muffy.
(Chuckling) Sire Muffy...
By your command.
The first patrol was eradicated.
No.
And the Colonial warrior?
Gone.
We found signs of humanoid renegades.
Our patrol is tracking them.
My commander sent me to report.
I hope your commander is more efficient than his predecessor.
(Explosion)
Oh, no.
(Explosions)
They will never learn.
Did you drop my message for the tin cans to find?
- What"s wrong?
- (Thunder)
- Kyle, we can"t do this.
- It"s the only way to get Father back.
- But Kyle...
- You want Father back, don"t you?
- Of course I do.
- Then there"s nothing to discuss.
We trade Starbuck to the tin cans for Father... tonight.
(Thunder)
(Sighs)
Why do you bother, Specter?
L"ll die long before you get anything out of me.
L"ve come to tell you that you will be freed, tonight.
Freed?
Oh, Lord, no.
What does he think he"s doing?
The only intelligent thing he can do.
Do you think me a fool, Specter?
Don"t you think I know you"ll never go through with this trade?
What you believe is irrelevant.
However, I will go through with it.
- Provided you cooperate.
- And if I don"t?
(Thunder)
I vow to slaughter your entire family at the exchange site.
- Kyle is much too clever for that.
- Is he?
He"s the one who proposed the trade.
Your son is getting desperate.
Why do you tell me all this?
If you"re gonna do it, just do it.
I want your word that once reunited with your family,
- you will stop these senseless attacks.
- You"d take my word?
I have come to learn that the word of some humanoids can be more binding than Cylon chain.
You are such a man.
- And the Colonial warrior?
- Not your concern.
Do I have your word?
- Excellent.
Make the signal.
- By your command.
I will see that you have clean garments.
I would not wish your children distressed by your appearance.
(Thunder)
Well, you"re looking fit, Lieutenant.
Whatever Miri put on my leg, it"s working.
Thanks, Miri.
(Horses snorting)
Feel up to riding?
Er, yeah, if needed.
I heard explosions.
Are they tracking you?
Not quite.
The Cylons only track us when we want them to.
- We are moving to a new camp.
- (Bell)
What was that?
The worship bell in our castle.
Kyle, please!
- (Horn sounds)
- Are you telling them where we are?
Just answering a challenge.
We shall be moving anyway.
- What if there are Cylon patrols nearby?
- Do not tell me how to command.
Well, someone better!
This is no time for heroics.
You think because you wear a uniform and fly in a fighter, you should be in charge.
Is that it?
Are you afraid I"m trying to take over?
- I fear no such thing.
- Kyle?
Kyle, is what he says true?
Ah, so... he smiles and you choose him.
- Him over Father.
- Father?
Your father"s dead.
Ah.
No, he"s captured.
Kyle, it won"t work.
The Cylons will never make a trade.
- You are very bright, Lieutenant.
- Hm.
I regret doing this but it"s the only chance our father has.
He is as good as dead and so are you if you meet with the Cylons!
- Bind him.
- Kyle, I don"t think...
That"s an order!
Bind him.
Starbuck... I"m sorry.
(Thunder)
Still no word from Attila?
Specter will contact us if he has anything to report.
Perhaps he feels his report will not be received satisfactorily, Baltar.
What are you implying, Lucifer?
I have discovered that Specter has ordered more laser pumps and petro than any other garrison.
So he"s stockpiling.
What commander doesn"t?
He has also ordered an extraordinary supply of laser rifles and metron bombs, certainly unnecessary requisitions for a planet whose entire population has supposedly been terminated.
Lucifer, do you wish me to believe that Specter would submit false reports?
Speaking from experience, I would not say it is beyond his programming.
(Cackling wickedly) Lucifer, I do believe you"re jealous!
Such a reaction is not programmed into IL series circuitry.
Commander, Specter reporting.
Ah, Specter.
You have the coordinates of the Galactica?
"Uh...
- "no."
- Hmm.
"The Colonial warrior was injured in the crash.
"We are attempting to repair his body
"in order to extract the information you need."
I see.
How long do you estimate this to take?
"Oh...
"Within five or six centares, he should have sufficiently recovered to torture."
L"m counting on you, Specter.
"I know.
"And may I say it is a distinct honour to serve the illustrious Baltar?
- "You are a legend to us..."
- Oh, feldercarb.
Well... thank you.
"By your command."
You see?
A logical explanation.
Yes...
You work on this while we move it.
L"ll work on this.
You need not worry about an infection.
It looks much better.
Terrific, I can walk to my execution.
Oh, please don"t, Starbuck.
- Perhaps they won"t...
- Kill me?
Miri, you saw what the Cylons did here.
They haven"t executed Father.
They"re probably trying to find your location through him.
Or wait for just what happened - a trade.
We will continue to attack them.
Perhaps we can get you back, too.
How?
Trade another human for me?
Huh?
No thanks, Miri.
I couldn"t live with that.
The raft is ready.
It"ll soon be time.
Do you really expect the Cylons to make this trade?
I certainly do.
I planned it rather well.
The tin cans will put Father on a boat and launch him towards us.
We will simultaneously launch you towards them.
You see, neither side can take advantage of the other.
- Wanna bet?
- Kyle, perhaps we are making a mistake.
It is a necessary tactical move.
We are talking about a human being, of trading him.
For our father!
Look, Miri, I know what I"m doing.
Have I not led well since Father"s capture?
Yes, but we are not an army.
We are a family.
Look at them.
Go on, look, Kyle.
- They"re just children.
- Yes, children who need their father.
Kyle, I agree with you but this isn"t the way.
Megan.
You keep your end of the bargain.
Kyle.
- Miri!
- (Miri) lt"s Father.
- Children!
- (Children) Father!
Kyle, it"s Father!
Kyle, please, just listen to me for a centon, will you?
L"m sorry, Lieutenant, but I have no choice.
(Horn sounds)
That"s the signal.
Make the exchange.
- Miri, it"s Father!
- Where?
- Over there.
- I can"t see him but he"s near.
- Which way is he coming?
- Do you see him?
(Bleeping)
We"ve kept our bargain.
Where is the Colonial warrior?
(Horn sounds)
Launch the raft.
- It"s Father.
- Father!
Father, look at us.
Oh, Kyle...
Starbuck was right.
Those little sclime.
They deceived me!
Well done, my children!
Well done!
Annihilate them!
Stay down.
- What will happen to Father?
- They"ll kill him, won"t they?
No.
They kept him alive to stop the raids.
This won"t change a thing.
- Are you sure, Starbuck?
- Of course I"m sure.
- Miri, take the kids.
- OK.
Go.
Starbuck, I almost made a grave tactical error.
L"m relinquishing my command, to you.
- I accept, on one condition.
- Name it.
That you continue as my lieutenant.
With pleasure.
What are your orders?
Well, the first... the first thing is to get out of here.
- And the second?
- To free your father.
Let"s go.
Anything?
Scanner"s clean.
We"ve been lucky so far.
How long until we orbit Attila?
Two centares, give or take a centon.
We"ll make a low-level approach from the backside.
Then I"ll turn it over to you.
You know where Starbuck went down.
It"s a big planet, Apollo.
Boomer...
I know where he went down.
(Sighs) Looks impenetrable.
Our fortress held out the longest when the tin cans invaded.
But there were too many.
Father and I fought a rearguard action while my brothers and sisters escaped.
How"d you get out?
Through the secret passage.
Uh...
Secret passage?
I know what you"re thinking but it won"t work.
I tried sneaking in that way once, but they"d made the main hall into a command post.
There are always two or three score in there.
We"d stand no chance.
What"s that between the castle wall and the moat?
That"s the petro dump.
They moved it closer because of our raids.
Lieutenant, I got an idea.
Come on.
My old flight instructor told me the easiest way to remember a sequence is to sing it.
So, one more time.
(All chant) Through the tunnel, under the land
Starbuck and Miri creep hand in hand
We swim the moat to the petro dump and blow it up with a great big whump
At the bridge the youngest daughter drops tin cans into the water
And around the castle the son first-born
Rides at a gallop and blows his horn... (Horn sounds)
"The first to go is Starbuck and Miri carrying torches to keep things cheery"
"Then the brothers swim through the water
"To set their bombs for a Cylon slaughter"
"Ariadne is ready to throw captured grenades at the bridge below"
"We go up the steps to the castle floor
"And sneak a peek through the secret door"
"Although the dump is double-guarded
"We"ll sneak across while the guards are parted
"Robus sets one bomb and then the other
"Leaving the rest to his older brother"
"When all is ready across the moat Kyle will sound the signal note"
I apologise for the delay.
The captured warrior is still unconscious.
- He may even terminate.
- Die?
"Unfortunately, we are programmed to destroy humans, not save them.
"Our knowledge of their anatomy is so limited.
"Still, I do not offer excuses
"despite my securing this planet for the Empire in record time.
"If this warrior terminates,
"I can only view my mission here as a failure.
"I will have failed one of the great leaders of our millennium - you, Baltar."
Oh, feldercarb.
Now, now, don"t be too hard on yourself, Specter.
"My reports tell me you"ve done a brilliant job on Attila."
- Well, we have had our problems.
- Problems?
This planet is so wet, half our garrison is down with rust.
"But I will spare no effort in saving the human
"and extracting the information you need.
"By your command."
You actually believe that daggit drivel?
Lucifer, this jealousy is simply not like you.
Specter is doing a wonderful job.
(Horn sounds)
Ah, no, not again.
- Petro dump is exploding.
- I know the petro dump is exploding!
- Dispatch a phalanx of centurions.
- By your command.
First phalanx, follow me.
(Chanting) "At the bridge the youngest daughter drops tin cans into the water."
(Horn sounds)
The phalanx on the bridge.
I see, I see!
Centurions!
Stop those...
those despicable renegades.
I sure hope this works.
I think what you"re doing is wonderful.
And I just wanted to thank you.
Well, we don"t have your father yet but... you"re welcome.
(Chanting) "Through all the confusion, noise and bother
"Starbuck and Miri rescue Father."
(Explosion)
(Horn sounds)
- Which tower?
- That one.
Yes, my children!
My warriors, well done!
Well done!
Megan!
Get down!
Father.
Oh, Father!
I hate to break up a family reunion but let"s go.
Looks like an entire sector is under attack.
Cylons must be taking over.
Set her down close.
Maybe we can help survivors.
I just hope Starbuck"s not in that inferno.
The renegades are within the walls.
- Inside the garrison?
- Unfortunately.
What else can go wrong?
"Any progress?"
Er...
I regret to report the Colonial warrior has... terminated.
- (Explosions) - "What was that?"
Er...
We are destroying the last humanoid habitats to assure that no one will ever find refuge on this miserable planet again.
"Excellent idea.
Scorched planet policy.
- "You"re a wonder, Specter."
- Thank you.
I have many such ideas and since this environment is so detrimental to our circuits, perhaps you would find use for me and my Centurions elsewhere.
"If it"s that destructive to your circuits then, naturally, abandon it.
"Report with your unit when you have destroyed the human abodes."
By your command.
Yes, I think we are through here.
Order all Centurions to the launch field.
- Father!
- My warriors.
Nilz.
They"re gone!
Running, all of them!
(Gasping for breath)
Lieutenant Kyle reporting that tin cans are fleeing to their transport ship.
- The area is secure, sir.
- Well done, Lieutenant.
Father.
You"ve done so well.
L"m very proud of you.
- Thank you, sir.
- You"re a good leader.
What hit this place?
An army?
- Apollo.
- Boomer!
- Starbuck!
- It"s about time you guys showed up.
- Got the clean uniform?
- What?
Clean?
What happened here?
Oh, er, not much.
My warriors just wiped out a Cylon garrison.
They"re children.
No, no.
They"re warriors.
- Just make it fast, OK?
- OK.
Well done, warriors.
Couple more yahren and you"ll be giving your big sister competition.
You can still come with us.
We"ve fought long and hard for this day.
Our ancestors originally migrated here from the Colonies but this is our home now.
If the Cylons return, we"ll be ready.
I don"t doubt it for a centon.
You earned this, Lieutenant.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
It"s been a pleasure serving you.
Ah, yes.
Miri.
You could"ve broken half the hearts on the Galactica.
Including mine.
I...
I don"t know how he does it.
Neither do I. Starbuck...
We have to go.
(Apollo) Starbuck...
(Adama) "Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny,
"the last battlestar, Galactica,
"leads a ragtag fugitive fleet
"on a lonely quest -
"a shining planet
"known as Earth."
Maintain silence until we land aboard the Battlestar Pegasus.
The Pegasus?
But that"s just not possible.
- You"re talking about Starbuck?
- I wasn"t comparing you.
But you"ll have to give me time to think.
Think of the impression on Gamoray when they learn that I personally led the final assault on the humans.
- L"m not getting anything on my scanner.
- You won"t.
- Then how are we...
- I can feel them, Captain.
We must take that base.
We must take Gamoray!
That is one opinion, Commander.
It does not happen to be mine.
- Starbuck?
- I don"t have a thing.
- There"s nothing in front of us.
- They"re behind us.
Behind us?
Oh, swell.
How close?
That close?
Apollo?
- It doesn"t look good.
L"m going right.
- L"ll take left.
Good luck, buddy.
Dispatching automatic distress to the fleet.
Be seeing ya.
- L"ll pick him up on the right.
- He"s dead on the left.
Be back in half a flash.
(Starbuck) I can"t lose him, Apollo.
I can"t shake him.
Cease fire.
- Cease fire.
That"s an order!
- Are you crazy?
Cain"ll have us for dinner if they get away.
- They"re human.
- What?
I said they"re human.
Impossible.
We"re the only ones left alive in the entire star system.
L"m switching to unicom.
Attention.
Attention.
This is Silver Spar Group Leader, commanding viper pilots to surrender.
We are locked on kill.
Apollo...
It has to be a trick.
This is Apollo, Strike Commander of the Battlestar Galactica.
Who are you?
- Bojay?
- I heard him.
It"s a trick.
They"re all dead.
Bojay?
Did he say Bojay?
- (Starbuck) Bojay, is that you?
- Starbuck?
Apollo, it is.
It"s Bojay!
You remember, he was in our squadron until...
That"s right, until he was transferred to... the Fifth Fleet.
(Starbuck) Died in the Battle of Molecay.
(Apollo) Two yahrens ago.
Apollo...
- either they"re not dead or...
- We are.
Bojay, if that"s really you, tell us what happened.
How did you survive?
Maintain silence until we land aboard the Battlestar Pegasus.
Pegasus?
But that"s just not possible.
Apollo, do you know whose ship that was?
Cain, the greatest military commander ever.
He was my idol.
Your idol will order you blasted away if you don"t shut off your transmitters.
In case you clowns don"t know, we are in a quadrant controlled by Cylons.
Oh, my Lord.
It isn"t a dream.
And we"re certainly not dead.
It is the Pegasus.
They won"t shut up.
They act as if they"ve seen an apparition.
L"m still not sure I haven"t.
Alert Commander Cain.
"We"re down to the last of it, Commander.
L"ve checked every ship.
"They"re down to life support now, unless we stop."
Thank you for your report, Jolly.
(Controller) Frequency intercept scrambled.
Running a check on both ID systems... 186 control on a speed deductor...
Well, that"s just fine.
Just fine.
We come all this way and simply run out of fuel.
- There"s worse.
- What does that mean?
- We"re picking up Cylon transmissions.
- Good Lord, a Cylon base star?
Lt"s not military.
What we"re hearing is civilian.
Civilian?
(Adama) I just don"t understand it.
- We"re a star system away from any...
- I can"t explain it.
But somewhere out there, not far away, is a city - a Cylon city.
That could be why our recon patrol is overdue.
Apollo, Starbuck?
How long before they exhaust their fuel supply?
If they"ve been using their thrusters, they"d be powered down right now.
Sir, if we launch a shuttle probe...
We must conserve every drop of fuel to support our life systems.
- Bring the fleet to a dead stop, please.
- Yes, Commander.
- It"s unbelievable, seeing you guys.
- How do you think we feel?
We sailed over two yahrens ago to save Molecay.
- We haven"t seen a human since.
- The rest of the Fifth Fleet?
Destroyed.
If Cain hadn"t pulled a brilliant decoy, we"d be gone, too.
You must have headed away from the Colonies to be this far out.
That was another of Cain"s touches.
He knew that they"d be waiting for us from Molecay to the Colonies, so he put us into deep space and we kept going.
- We"ve been fighting ever since.
- Running.
Our skipper doesn"t know the meaning of the word run.
- We strike round the clock.
- With what?
- Where do you get your fuel and arms?
- From the Cylons, of course.
If you officers will excuse our guests,
Commander Cain would like to see them in his quarters.
Get them a drink, Tolen.
They look pale.
It"s a very great honour, sir.
A very great honour.
Yes, I should imagine it is.
That"s just a little attempt at humour.
L"d quite resigned myself that I would never see another human, other than my own people on the Pegasus,
- yet there you are.
- The Galactica, sir.
Under the flag of Commander Adama, my father.
- Adama?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, yes.
Yes, I see it.
Well, how is he?
How is that old modocker?
Considering the load he"s carried since the destruction of our nation...
Yes, I should imagine.
And the rest of the fleet?
Only the Galactica survived, sir, along with some 220 ships carrying what"s left of our people.
My God.
And I thought we had it bad.
- Only 220 ships from all the Colonies?
- Yes, sir.
Well, my friends, our troubles are over.
- How do you mean, sir?
- Tomorrow we go on the offensive.
We"ll show those golmonging Cylons how to fight now!
Yes, by the Lords of Kobol, the Cylon Empire is about to fall!
We"re picking up something very odd.
- What is it?
- It"s some sort of visual echo.
I mean, the Galactica"s image must be bouncing off some ion field.
Feed it up to the bridge.
(Tigh) Omega, have this scan turret checked immediately.
Yes, Colonel.
Switch to high band.
There"s something wrong.
It"s a visual echo.
It"s the cleanest transmission l"ve ever seen.
Nevertheless...
- There"s a signal on fleet comline Alpha.
- That"s impossible.
Fleet comline is a scramble communicator between warships and since we"re the only battlestar, there"s no possibility of a signal like that existing.
"Greetings, Adama, you old wardaggit.
"Might"ve known I"d find you and your fleet sitting on your astrums."
Cain?
!
Of all that"s holy.
"There"s nothing holy about me, Adama.
"Except maybe what I"m doing to those golmonging Cylons."
Lt"s a miracle, Cain.
A blessed miracle.
"I make my own miracles.
"But have it your way.
L"ll be aboard in a few centons."
L"ll have some vintage Ambrosa for you.
"I should think so."
(Cheering)
Commander...
It"s impossible.
Cain perished along with the Fifth Fleet two yahrens ago.
Yes, Colonel, but that"s the fabric of miracles - the impossible.
"Commander Cain requesting permission to board the Galactica."
The Lords of Kobol bless you.
You have no idea how I feel at this moment.
Me too, Adama, me too.
I have a present for you.
Where are those space loiterers we picked up?
Front and centre!
(Applause)
Son.
I thought I"d seen the last of you.
You would have, if my daughter hadn"t cut them off.
- They were heading into Gamoray.
- The Delphian Empire?
It was.
Before the Cylons turned it into their outer capital.
It"s now a model of machine efficiency.
- That was a society of 50 million beings.
- Not any more.
When it was clear that the Fifth Fleet was destroyed,
I took every survivor I could aboard the Pegasus.
I headed straight for Gamoray, their most remote supply base.
We"ve been living off them ever since.
It"s incredible.
If they control Gamoray, they control half the universe.
The only thing I"ve been able to do is keep knocking that base down so they can"t get a full strike at me.
What I"ve never understood is why they didn"t send out base ships to finish us off.
- It"s clear now why they didn"t.
- Yes, the Galactica.
They were having trouble with a rebel fleet but I couldn"t break the code.
I had no idea that there were any other survivors.
Oh, nor did we.
You"ve given a tremendous lift to all our people.
And a death blow to the Cylons.
We"re going to take them now, Adama.
This is the turning point.
No, my old friend, the most we can hope to get from the Cylons is some fuel.
- A military victory"s out of the question.
- What are you talking about?
L"ve had them on their knees in this quadrant - with just one battlestar.
With two - ha!
- L"ll finish them!
- At least on Gamoray.
- And then what?
Well, then we"ll have all the fuel we need and a base from which to attack.
We can"t secure that planet.
And those base ships not bothering you were after me, en masse.
No, our only hope is to just keep moving.
- You mean run?
- I mean escape.
But why?
We can outfly them, we can outfight them, we...
In case you haven"t noticed, I"m protecting 220 civilian ships which crawl along in space at a pace which is perfect for target practice.
- There must be some way.
- I wish there were.
But your knowledge of the Cylon supply lines will be invaluable.
- If we could intercept Cylon tankers...
- Why bother with tankers?
Go straight for that fuel base at Gamoray.
I can"t leave those ships unprotected while we go off to take some planet.
Hades" hole, Adama!
Give me a couple of your best squadrons and I"ll take that fuel base myself.
You"ll have enough fuel to go anyplace in the stars.
L"ll be satisfied with enough to get us out of this quadrant.
Prepare battle plans for capturing those tankers and I"ll approve them.
Meanwhile, enjoy a few centons of well-deserved hospitality on the Galactica.
Well, if that"s the way you want it.
(Cain) There"s a certain young lady that I"m most anxious to find.
It"s quite unlikely that out of all those people from the Colonies she"d be one of the few survivors, but she always knew how to take care of herself.
Well... what was her name?
Her name is Cassiopeia.
"L"ll never forget you, you old wardaggit.
"Hurry back."
I can see she has the same effect on you she"s always had on me.
And apparently you"ve never seen her before.
Speaking of lovely ladies, you met my daughter.
"Happy birthday, Father.
I love you."
If I"d met that young lady, I"d know it.
You met her.
She almost flew you right out of your britches.
Like father, like daughter.
- What are you going to do?
- Find a way to let him down easy.
You don"t just jump on a hero.
You"re assuming Cassiopeia won"t be as excited as everybody else he"s back.
Apollo...
Oh, I forgot.
Once they experience the aura of Starbuck...
I never said that.
It"s true, but I never said it.
Let"s face it, he is an older man.
You"re on your own.
(Sighs) Cassiopeia?
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hiya, Starbuck.
Is my father back?
Er, yeah, yeah, kid.
He is.
What"s the matter?
He"s not hurt?
Oh, no.
It"s nothing like that.
Come on, Muffy.
We"re gonna find my dad.
Starbuck...
What is it?
Something is wrong, isn"t there?
L"ve...
I"ve got some news for you.
It"s... about an old friend of yours.
Someone you may have been involved with or just...
liked.
I don"t know which but... he"s been found - alive.
- Who?
- Look, I know it"s over between you but he"s a legend, we"ll have to let him down easy.
If you wanna do it, fine.
But I"ll be glad to handle it for you if it"s going to be too awkward.
- Starbuck, who are we talking about?
- Er, Commander Cain.
Cassiopeia!
(Door bleeping)
Enter.
Cassie.
L"d almost given up hope.
Oh, I missed you so.
But I had to stop thinking about you too much.
I wouldn"t expect you to, especially with all those young warriors around.
They"re all in love with you, I"m sure.
No.
Only one.
- Starbuck.
- Starbuck?
He"s a great warrior.
Oh, he is, huh?
I wasn"t comparing you.
But you"ll have to give me time to think.
We may not have much time.
I know.
Well, how"d she take the news?
Worse than I thought.
She...
She wanted to be alone, so...
Starbuck, are you in a little pain?
No.
What are you talking about?
Hey, it"s me, Apollo, remember?
We talk about things.
Yeah, well, I, er...
I guess I never did like to admit that I form...
- attachments.
- You don"t even admit it to yourself.
L"ve never understood that about you.
You were always part of a very big family.
I never had that.
So I just grew up keeping the number of people around me as large as I could.
So you couldn"t be hurt by any particular one?
Look, I don"t care if Cassiopeia feels something for this Cain.
I just don"t understand the combination.
I mean he"s, er... he"s...
- Too old?
- Yeah.
Read up on your Book Of The Word.
Some of the Elders of Kobol were married to some very young wives.
Wives?
Aren"t we getting a little ahead of ourselves here?
She wouldn"t marry him.
Anyway... who cares?
Not me!
Poor Starbuck.
Oh, well.
He still has Athena and Miriam and Noday and...
Would you stop?
And who told you to listen, anyway?
What about Sheba?
She"s developed into one of our best warriors.
She"ll be very unhappy that I"ve returned.
Children don"t understand a man"s needs at different times in his life.
You came into my life right after her mother died.
It may have been difficult for Sheba but if it weren"t for you, I...
Did you ever think maybe Sheba wanted to fill that role?
She"s my daughter.
I could be your daughter as well.
You could be... but you aren"t.
Our basic strategy has just been to keep knocking down their base on Gamoray.
Every time they send one of their leaders in to rededicate that base, we go in and turn it into scrap metal.
Oh.
Hey, what about you guys?
You"ve got to be raising feldercarb with those tinheads.
We do our best.
We just shot down a Cylon patrol ship.
- Mind if I join you?
- No, by all means.
Apollo, Strike Captain Apollo.
I believe you"ve spent a lot of time on my tail?
You are Sheba?
Yes, to both questions.
You can"t be serious.
You shot down one Cylon patrol ship in a secton?
Very serious.
When you"re responsible for the lives of civilians crammed onto slow barges, you have to keep a low profile.
Sounds like we"re incompatible.
We all have to learn to adjust.
Even the legendary Commander Cain may have to alter his combat techniques.
And who"s going to tell him that?
As a student of your father"s tactics, I think he"ll realise on his own.
(Apollo) If not...
(Officer) Ten-hup!
Sit, sit.
Relax everybody, relax.
We"re off prime!
This is good.
Good, what you"re doing - getting acquainted.
Since we"re all going to be fighting together, side by side,
- l"m buying the first round.
- (Cheering)
Ambrosa for everyone.
For all my warriors!
Come, my sweet Cassiopeia.
If you"ll excuse me, I think I"ve had enough combat for now.
- Nothing changes.
- Everything changes.
Not people.
Sheba?
Can we talk?
Not now.
L"m really not up to it.
We"re gonna have to work together if we want to survive.
Working with you won"t be the problem.
This is the route where the Cylons run their fuel ships.
Their convoy has already left Gamoray.
But if we use turbos all the way, we can catch them before they leave this quadrant.
Turbos all the way.
We"ve barely enough fuel to get there and back.
- We wouldn"t need any more than that.
- Surely the tankers have a fighter escort.
In a prolonged battle you"d run out of reserves.
I don"t fight prolonged battles with Cylons.
They"re not that good.
(Adama) We"ll send one squadron from each battlestar.
No offence but... I"d prefer to use just my own wings on this manoeuvre.
I think for the purpose of morale, it might be best if we started to integrate our squadrons, give them a sense of teamwork.
Whatever you say.
My warriors will pass on their experience.
Let"s get to it.
Is there anything he doesn"t do better than the rest?
Lt"s his way of talking.
He"s one of the best.
L"ve never seen anyone so treated like a... a god in my life.
We must remember that he"s kept his people alive in this Cylon territory for two yahrens.
His men would do anything for him.
Rightfully so.
I hope you know that this adulation, this awe everybody feels for him,
- doesn"t alter our feelings about you.
- Oh, Apollo.
We"re not in a popularity contest, we"re in a struggle for survival.
We need heroes that our people can look up to, gather strength from.
We need him.
- They feel that way about you.
- I hope I never disappoint them.
Get going.
I don"t want the Blue Squadron reaching those tankers after Cain has flown the Colonial flag.
There"s a matter of pride involved here.
- Yes, sir.
- Son... good luck.
Father?
They told me you"re going on the mission.
It"s just a routine strike.
We can"t afford risking you.
We can"t afford not to.
L"ll explain later.
Transferring control to Silver Spar Squadron.
Launch when ready.
Strike wing standing by.
Blue Squadron ready to rendezvous with Silver Spar Squadron.
- Four centons to target.
- Doesn"t that sound like Cain?
- Commander Cain.
Boomer, isn"t it?
- Yes, but...
I know everyone in my command.
Three centons to target.
L"m not getting anything on my scanner.
- If we"re only...
- They won"t be on your scanner.
- Then how...
- I can feel them, Captain.
Just ahead is an ionised cloud level.
Our target will be hiding there.
Split up.
I thought we were a single strike force.
A dozen escort fighters are ready to jump us.
We do this my way.
Blue Squadron, head in.
Silver Spar, follow me.
He"s flying evasive tactics and I don"t see...
I think he knows what he"s doing.
We"ll know in a micron.
Stand by to penetrate cloud layer.
There she is, a Cylon tanker.
Two Cylon tankers.
I don"t see any sign of...
OK, Blue Squadron, go to work.
Don"t hit any of those tankers.
There"s an awful lot of them.
Jolly, you got one on your tail!
Roll, Jolly.
He"s on you!
I can"t seem to lose him!
Let"s go get"em.
- Thank you, whoever that was.
- My pleasure.
(Cain) Captain, on your left wing.
L"ve got him, Apollo.
- Two of "em running.
- Blue Squadron.
Pursue.
That"s all of them.
Let"s escort those tankers in.
- (Apollo) Commander?
- Yes, what is it, Captain?
Were you aiming at a fighter?
I didn"t see him.
You didn"t?
He was as clear as the Nubian sun to me.
- Where are the two tankers?
- (Cain) I don"t know.
We"ve come up empty.
Let"s regroup and head for home.
L"m sorry, Adama, but with all those ships in the air fighting for their lives in and around those tankers,
I guess maybe we should"ve sent just my squadrons.
We do have a little more experience in hit-and-run tactics.
Yes, I suppose it was a mistake mixing forces that never fought together.
Commander, with respect,
Blue Squadron was nowhere near when the tankers blew up!
Nothing personal, Apollo.
You and your squadron handled yourselves as well as I"ve ever seen.
It was an honour to have you along and I wouldn"t dream of attacking that Cylon base without you.
We"re going against the whole base?
I don"t think we have any choice now.
Do we?
Events seem to have left us very few alternatives.
L"ll give you my decision in the morning.
We can"t wait until morning.
We have to work on my battle plan right now.
In the morning.
- Adama, with all due...
- Dismissed.
L"ll be in the Officers" Club when you make up your mind.
Sheba.
Father, he...
Nothing.
Sheba!
L"d like to talk to you.
- I was about to join my father...
- That"s OK.
Cassiopeia and I will save you a place.
Look, I really don"t feel well.
- What happened to those tankers?
- They were hit by incidental fire.
You"re telling me that someone as good as you are blew the whole purpose of this mission by accident?
- Yes, that"s what I"m saying.
- Then we have found witnesses.
A toast to our victory over the Cylons!
(All) Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
The data from the scanners aboard the Pegasus make it clear that an attack would result in the forfeiture of countless lives.
Those are losses unacceptable to me, even if we could board fuel from the Cylon depot.
Adama, we have no choice.
Your fleet is standing dead in the sky.
It"s only a matter of time before their base ships attack.
There is a choice.
According to my data, the Pegasus is carrying a maximum fuel load.
I intend to divide part of that load amongst the fleet.
- What?
- Only a sufficient amount to get our people out of this quadrant without loss of life.
With any luck, our scanners will be able to locate a secondary fuel source before we run out of it again.
Commander, with all due respect, we cannot risk the lives of our people on luck.
All the fuel we need is right there at that base
- Gamoray.
And we have two full battlestars to hit them with.
What would happen if we left our fleet of civilian ships unguarded
- while we conquered a planet?
- We"d be in and out before they know.
We have been dogged by Cylon ships since we left our star system.
They strike without warning.
They could be massing now.
Anything is possible.
But I prefer to deal with the probable.
The probabilities are with our combined strength we can achieve our first clean victory since we lost the war.
L"m not interested in victories.
L"m interested in saving lives, what few of them are left.
L"m sorry.
Colonel, carry out the task of distributing the Pegasus fuel throughout the fleet.
Commander.
I will not allow that.
You have no choice.
I think I do.
I think two yahrens of surviving the Cylons in this quadrant without any help from you or the Colonies has earned my people, my crew, the right to decide their own destiny.
In the same way you decided the destiny of two Cylon tankers?
I did what I thought I had to do to assure the survival of our people.
How long do you suppose the fuel from those two tankers would last?
We need enough fuel to sustain this fleet indefinitely.
We must take that base.
We must take Gamoray!
That is one opinion, Commander.
It does not happen to be mine.
So I"m going to relieve you of any further responsibility of making decisions contrary to orders.
You are relieved of your command.
Colonel Tigh, you will assume the bridge of the Pegasus.
Father?
I want you to know that we will follow you in whatever you decide to do.
Thank you, but you heard the man, I don"t decide anything any more.
- Sir, what we meant...
- I know what you meant.
But what I did this morning was tactical misjudgement.
What you"re thinking of is mutiny.
Oh, I may be the most stubborn, egocentric warrior ever in the Colonies but I"m also the best and I won"t be remembered as the one who pulled out and left defenceless civilians at the mercy of those... tinheaded golmonging Cylons.
By your command.
- Speak.
- We"ve found the Colonial trailing ships.
They turned back before discovery, I presume.
By your order.
Very well done.
This is the final moment.
At long last I"ve overtaken Adama with sufficient strength to blow him out of the sky.
- It should be quite a good battle.
- It will be no battle at all.
A single battlestar is no match for three base ships.
Oh, no, what we have here, my dear Lucifer, is what is known as a rout, a humiliation, a massacre.
Then you do not wish support fighters from Gamoray, our outer capital?
The only thing I want from Gamoray is a welcoming parade, a victory celebration, a tribute from the people of Gamoray for the greatest military leader Cylon has ever known.
L"ve decided that the city of Gamoray will be my seat of power.
From it, I will decide how and where I will extend my dominion throughout the star system.
Begging your pardon, Baltar, but shouldn"t we first go through the formality of conquering the humans before ordering our victory celebration?
That had the note of sarcasm, Lucifer.
Watch yourself.
You"re not the only IL-series Cylon who dreams of standing beside the greatest conqueror in the universe.
- Forgive my impudence.
- Hm.
- About that launch order...
- Yes, yes, let"s get on with it.
Wait.
Wait, I have an even better idea.
I will accompany the strike force.
- You, go into...
- Yes, yes.
Think of the impression on Gamoray when they learn that I personally led the final assault on the humans.
Prepare a ship with two of your best pilots.
By your command.
"Captain Apollo requesting permission to board the Pegasus."
Colonel, fuelling shuttles are starting to come aboard.
Proceed with fuel distribution to all ships in the fleet.
Yes.
There"s bad feeling festering aboard this ship.
Shouldn"t we delay this order until things settle down?
Commander Adama wants the fleet able to get underway quickly.
We can"t do that without fuel.
Now, carry out the order.
- Can we be of some help?
- Only in the transfer of fuel.
- What transfer is that?
- We have a job to do.
Stand aside.
- What are you doing?
- Fighting for our commander.
- And our lives.
- He accepted the order.
Why don"t you show the same good sense?
Look, Captain, maybe you don"t understand the situation.
Adama humiliated the greatest man that ever lived, who can think and fight circles around your father.
She"s right, Apollo.
He saved us from certain death.
Now it"s our turn to help him.
No one wants to see Cain hurt or disgraced.
- Isn"t it a bit late to say that?
- Commander Adama had no choice.
There can only be one leader.
And we"ve got the wrong one.
That"s why you"re not taking our fuel.
L"m only going to say this one more time.
Adama is the fleet commander, he"s determined that we don"t send our defences off to a Cylon capital while our fleet sits here helpless!
I support that thinking, so stand aside!
Well, now, what"s it gonna be?
- (Alarm)
- Just what Adama was afraid of.
We"re under attack.
Back to the ship.
Large Cylon task force coming in.
- (Woman) 50 microns and closing.
- Get me the Galactica.
Sir, 45 microns and closing.
That"s the largest force I"ve seen since the destruction of Caprica.
- What is it?
What have they got?
- We"re not certain.
But from the number of bombers, they have three base ships moving in.
You were right, I was wrong.
The fleet would"ve been defenceless if we had attacked.
Right now I need you and your tactical wizardry.
They used only three ships to wipe out our fleet at Caprica.
Surprise was on their side then.
This time, it might be on our side.
Pull out the Pegasus.
Exactly.
It"s on the far side of our fleet.
I doubt if it"s on their scanners yet.
L"ll bring it around and squeeze them in-between us.
Don"t take too long to be in position.
If it"s OK to burn up half my fuel, I"ll bring it up to light speed.
- Do I have a choice?
- No.
- Be there when we need you.
- L"ll be there.
Commander, 25 microns and closing.
Arm weapons.
Stand by to attack.
This is going to be a classic defeat, spoken of throughout the star system for 1,000 yahrens.
Launch fighters.
Incoming communication from Commander Cain, sir.
Put it on the line.
L"m resuming command of the Pegasus.
So I"ve been informed by Commander Adama.
Good.
Get that ship out of there.
Swing on a 180 and follow course 1-1-0.
L"ll rendezvous with you.
- What about the attack force?
- Let me worry about that.
Have pilots launch-ready.
L"ll be aboard soon.
(Cheering)
Lt"s nothing personal, sir.
It"s just that...
I quite understand.
Who can fight a living legend?
(Baltar) Goodbye, Galactica.
Goodbye, Adama.
You"re finished.
Positive shield, now.
(Adama) Commence fire.
(Pilot) Let"s go get"em.
This time, the Galactica hasn"t a chance.
(Baltar) Concentrate our fighters on the landing bays.
Her warriors won"t be able to refuel, reload or land.
- Fire in the bay.
- Damage report.
It"s out of control.
Alpha Bay is completely cut off.
Keep leading her warriors away from the main fleet.
They can"t stay aloft using full battle thrusters for long.
(Cylon) A word of caution.
We too, are expending great amounts of fuel in a sustained attack.
Yes, but we have a place to land.
They do not.
Or will not before long.
We are running parallel to the Cylons on their rear flank.
The Galactica is reporting heavy damage to her landing bays.
Bring her around 60 degrees.
We"re going in.
Burn, Galactica.
(Baltar) You"re finished, Adama!
(Cylon) Sir, if I may...
I don"t want to miss a moment of the last battlestar"s destruction.
(Cylon) I really think you should look at the other battlestar.
What are you babbling about?
- It"s impossible.
- No, it is a battlestar.
Turn, you fool!
Turn!
He"s coming right for us!
Jesus Christ!
Look at this.
My sneaker's ruined!
- They're only $35.
- Fucking city's turned into one big pile of dog shit!
Come on out and take a crap on me!
Everybody else is!
Fuck.
- Give it back to the poodles.
- What's the point of jogging for two and a half miles?
Giving yourself lung cancer.
Tell you somethin', Erica.
The longer I'm married to you... the more you sound like my mother.
Clean your own sneaker.
- You wanted me to step in it.
- You're going crazy, Martin.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Why would I want you to step in dog shit?
Well, that's a good question.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not your mother.
- You know.
- Yeah.
Listen, do you think we got time for a little quickie?
I got about 11 minutes.
Hey, come on!
Gimme a break here.
I'm gettin' frostbite.
Jesus, I got to quit smoking.
- I saw Jacobs on Tuesday.
Did I tell you?
- Uh-uh.
Yeah, I went in for my annual physical.
How are you?
Fine.
You sound surprised.
Well, you know, I go up there for the damn thing... and my blood pressure goes up 20 points from the anxiety of having to take the exam.
- What are you doing today?
- Working at the gallery.
Oh, yeah.
Goin'to school.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
Hmm.
Did the earth move?
Bye.
I'm telling you, we expose that kid to too much.
- Well, we still lock the door.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Have a good time.
See you tonight.
- Mm-hmm.
"Tonight, the ballet world was introduced...
"to a brilliant new talent—
"the long-awaited debut of Erica Benton.
"Miss Benton astounded the ballet world last night... in her incredible performance of Swan Lake. "
"Her pas de deux were breathtaking."
- Hello.
- Hi.
There she is.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are you?
- You look great.
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.
You're just in time for some big news.
- Well.
- Oh, hi.
Uhhh.
- Wine.
- Let's have a glass— another carafe.
Okay?
- Yeah.
And, uh...
- Anything else?
- Steamer Vic.
- Refills for everybody.
- Are you ready?
- You're in love.
Would that I were.
It's not my news.
- Sue.
- The only thing that happened to me last week was... my elevator man got arrested for flashing.
- What is it, Jeannette?
- I met a man.
Well, that's terrific!
- Well, there's a little problem.
- He's married.
No.
- He's very young.
- You're not close.
- How young?
- He's 19.
- Oh, Jesus.
- I know.
I know.
- He's very mature.
- Nineteen?
The problem is:
Does she fuck him, or does she adopt him?
I'm a terrible person.
I'm drunk, and I'm giddy, and I'm going to the loo.
- Sorry, Jeannette.
- It's okay.
I think Elaine's going through early menopause.
It is so ironic.
I've dated so many men... in the last few years that were my age or older... and Steven— his name is Steven— is the first man that I've really liked...
- since my divorce.
- Well, what's he like?
He's calm, quiet.
He doesn't come on.
He's very bright.
He's not afraid to be tender.
Well, if you were a man and you were talking about a 19-year-old girl... then there would be no problem, would there?
No, I worry about Teddy.
I mean, how do you tell a six-year-old child his new daddy is a teenager?
- Where does he live now?
- With his parents.
Maybe I should adopt him.
Did I miss anything?
No.
It's just that last night was so incredible.
I put Teddy to bed, and Steven came over.
We just sat and talked all night long.
- I mean, till 7:00 this morning.
- What did you talk about?
We talked a lot about loneliness.
- Got kind of emotional.
- Then?
- Promise you won't laugh?
- I promise.
Well, then he undressed me, and he gave me a massage.
And it was the most incredible experience I think I've ever had in my life.
- I'll bet.
- Was it sexual?
That's it.
It was and it wasn't.
I mean, he massaged my feet and my toes... and he massaged my fingers.
He massaged my eyes.
He actually massaged my eyes.
And then I had an orgasm.
And then another and then another.
I'd say it was sexual.
There ain't nothin' wrong with a good, old-fashioned eyeball orgasm.
Oh, I love them.
I mean, I couldn't live without them.
- Have you read the latest book?
- No, I didn't.
- You think I'm going crazy.
- Crazy?
What's this boy's phone number?
- Don't be offended, okay?
- No.
What?
What?
- Is he being honest with you?
- That's pretty naive, Erica.
- No, it isn't.
- No, it's not.
There's no such thing as total honesty... not with men.
They're all wrapped up in sexual ego.
- What the hell is sexual ego, Elaine?
- Never getting enough.
Always on the make.
Constantly worried about performing.
That's ridiculous.
I know lots of men who are interested in other things besides sex.
- Name one.
- My husband.
Harold hasn't made a pass in six months.
Well, listen, Elaine.
Don't you think you're taking this thing a little too far?
Me?
No.
- I think you're getting to be a man-hater.
- I love men!
We're talking about their honesty.
- Do you think Martin is totally honest?
- I don't think about it.
I think Erica has the second-best man in the five boroughs.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, I'm sure.
I think what I'm gonna do is just go along with things the way they are...
- and just see what happens.
- Have fun, honey.
The worst that can happen is that it'll end.
No, I think the worst that could happen is that his parents will find out.
You're fabulous.
- I love you.
- Swiftly moving on.
Patti?
Hello?
Hi.
- Giris had a long meeting tonight, huh?
- They're not meetings.
- What's on the news?
- Nothin'.
They're shootin' up Rhodesia, and, uh, the garbagemen are raising' hell again.
You know.
Jeannette is having an affair with a 19-year-old boy.
Oh, shit.
She's flipped.
Men go out with younger women all the time.
Nineteen is four years older than Patti.
Yeah, where is Patti?
She went to the movies with Phil.
- I like Phil.
- Well, maybe Phil should meetJeannette.
- Martin.
- How are Elaine and Sue?
- Fine.
- Elaine makes me very nervous.
- She likes you.
- Yeah.
I like her all right.
She just comes on too strong.
So do you sometimes.
Sometimes I get the feeling that you prefer Elaine and Sue and Jeannette to me.
That's ridiculous, Martin.
- Do you?
- Sometimes.
Look, Martin.
Patti's coming home.
I have to get up early.
Martin, I'm not in the mood.
You give me a headache.
- Take an aspirin.
- Shit.
Anybody home?
We're in here, honey.
What's goin' on in there?
Want me to go out and come in again?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How was the movie?
- Good.
We saw the new Lina Wertmüller film.
- Yeah?
Did you like it?
- I loved it.
But Phil thought it was flawed.
How old is Phil again?
You know how old he is.
Why?
Well, your mother's friend Jeannette is having an affair with a 19-year-old guy.
- Good for her.
- Yeah?
- Would Phil go out with Jeannette?
- I don't know.
You'd have to ask Phil.
Don't say anything aboutJeannette.
Who am I gonna tell?
- You and Daddy fighting?
- No, it's not a fight.
- Daddy doesn't look too happy.
- Mmm!
- Good night.
- Good night.
Jesus.
You're acting like a five-year-old kid.
- I know.
I know.
- It's wonderful when you're in the mood and I'm in mood.
But, God!
It's not much fun when you make me feel like it's an obligation.
I know.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Besides, we had sex this morning.
What do you want?
Guess I'm not much fun to live with, am I?
Are you okay?
- I don't know.
- What is it?
I don't know.
I just... find myself—
I just— I'm anxious all the time, you know.
About what?
I just— I'm fantasizing and—
- About what?
- Uhh.
About changing my life.
Quit Wall Street, go be a disc jockey somewhere.
I don't know.
- Tired of your job?
- I'll tell you something.
I've been the takeover type all my life.
I mean, in school, in the navy... probably with you, certainly with Patti.
- There's nothing wrong with being a strong man.
- That's the point.
- I'm not a strong man.
I don't feel like a strong man.
- You are!
Well, I feel tired.
I don't know what to say.
You should see a psychiatrist.
Really.
I
- I don't think so.
Is it me?
Are you tired of me?
I love you.
Aww.
I'd hate to join the crowd.
Why?
What do you mean?
Oh, Elaine's boozing a lot.
Jeannette's crazy.
Sue's okay.
She's a strong woman.
- God.
- Well, so are you.
I'm beginning to wonder about me.
Oh, it's so nice to have a man to come home to.
- Is that just luck?
- Yeah.
It's luck and a fabulous body.
Jesus.
Here, three kids in the sixth grade beat their teacher up.
Where?
The Bronx.
- You never have any trouble in school, do you?
- No.
It's a jungle.
It is!
They got guys carrying guns.
Oh, you read too much.
- I what?
- It doesn't really happen that way.
Well, it doesn't happen where you go to school, because we got you in a pretty good school.
- It's costing me a lot of money.
- Oh, I'll go to public school.
- Okay.
You're on.
- Okay.
- You think that's funny?
- We'll buy you a gun, send you to public school.
- I'm sorry.
I'm getting tickets to the ballet a week from Friday.
Do you want to go?
- I don't know.
Let me ask Phil.
- Phil can come with us.
Only if he pays.
- I don't think Phil likes ballet.
- I don't either.
I'm goin'.
Good for your soul.
No.
I think I'll pass, Mom.
- Listen, am I a nagging father?
- No.
You're just feeling the loss of separation.
I'm not your little girl anymore.
Wash your mouth with soap!
- Hey, no physical contact, please!
- Got to go.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Do you think Daddy's worried about getting old?
- Are you taking a psych course this year?
- Mm-hmm.
He's always joking.
Never seems to take anything seriously, you know.
You mean, he doesn't take Phil seriously, and that bothers you.
No, it doesn't.
I don't take Phil that seriously either.
Oh, I think you're serious about Phil.
Mom, I'm still a virgin, if that's what you meant.
It's not what I meant.
But I'm glad you told me.
- I just meant that you like Phil.
- I like Phil.
I'm not gonna marry him.
I'm never getting married.
- You will.
- Don't be so sure.
- Why not?
- Why should I?
Everybody I know who's married is either miserable or divorced.
- I don't want that.
- Oh, Patti.
That's ridiculous!
- There's a lot of happily married couples.
- Name three.
- Uhh.
- Uh.
- I'll have to think about it.
- Yeah.
See you later.
383 West Broadway, please.
Now, if all this stuff wasn't done by a woman...
I don't think you could sit in the same room with it.
It isn't "stuff," Charlie.
It happens to be art.
You're a classic male chauvinist pig.
I know, but I'm cute.
- You're out of style, Charlie.
- Want a bite?
Uh-uh.
You're a beautiful woman, Erica.
- But you're leading such a sheltered life.
- How can you tell?
It's in your eyes.
You can tell everything in a woman's eyes.
Oh.
Can you tell everything in a man's eyes?
Men cover it up.
Women lay it all on the line.
Right there in the old eyes.
What do you see in my eyes, Charlie?
- Want me to be honest?
- Yeah.
You're not gettin' enough.
I think you ought to have your eyes examined.
Oh, no.
No, you're not really satisfied.
I mean, your old man's okay and all that, but, uh... underneath it all you're frustrated.
Go paint a still life, Charlie.
- You ever had an affair?
- It's none of your business.
Oh, man.
What a shame.
What a waste!
A woman as beautiful as you should be tasting a little variety in life.
Imagine if all you ever ate was apples?
Imagine never tasting a peach or a pear?
Apapaya?
Huh?
No way, babe.
Same thing with sex.
I'm allergic to papayas, Charlie.
How about a nice, fresh guava?
Huh?
- Huh?
- Leave me alone.
- Don't you ever think about anything else, Charlie?
- Yeah, like what?
Ohh, there's literature and ballet...
- and theater and dance...
- Hey, hey, hey, Erica.
- And architecture—
- Erica.
Hey, listen.
There's work, there's food, and there's sex.
That's the whole ball game.
Rowan Gallery.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
I'll meet you.
Um, 15 minutes.
Okay, honey.
Bye.
Might I inquire as to who "honey" is?
My husband.
I'm meeting him for lunch.
Well...
- think I'll hit the streets for awhile.
- Bye, Charlie.
- Hi.
- Is this together?
Uh, yeah, he's paying for me.
That'll be $3.95.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Mmm, I wanted to talk to you about something.
I think that if we're gonna go to the island this summer... that we really ought to get on it right away.
How would you feel about sharing a place with Sue and Harold?
- How's the market?
- Huh?
Just wanted to see if you were paying any attention to me.
- You want to share a place with Sue and Harold.
- Think you could handle it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Well, I'll talk to Sue, and maybe the four of us could drive out in a couple of weeks.
We really should get on it right away.
Jesus, it's gonna be even more expensive this year.
You know, if we do take a place... we're gonna have to have my club up there.
I could just see us, all lying in the sun, blabbing away.
I mean, we would— We talk.
We really do.
I love our meetings.
They're so— I don't know.
I just love them.
It's sort of like a continuing story, you know.
It's part Mary Hartman and part Ingmar Bergman.
L— I love the women.
Marty.
Marty.
Come on.
What is it, honey?
What's the matter?
What is it?
- Th—What?
Tell me!
- I'm in love with somebody else.
I've been seeing another woman... for over a year.
Andatfirst,you know, I thought it was just a—a fling.
But it isn't.
I love her.
I want to live with her.
Oh, God.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt Patti.
But I—
I can't—
You don't know her or anything.
Her name is Marcia Brenner.
She's a— She's a teacher.
She's, uh, 26.
I met her— I met her at Bloomingdale's, for Christ's sake.
I was standing there buying a shirt, you know.
And she, uh—
She was standing next to me.
She asked me, uh... if I liked the shirt that, uh, she was buying for her father.
Oh, God.
I'msosorry.
You tell Patti— You tell Patti that you're sorry.
I'm in love with her.
Ohhh.
- She a good lay?
- Oh, she—
The first thing we have to do is get you a good lawyer.
I just can't believe it.
I really liked Martin.
- This is not a time to pity Martin.
- I am not pitying Martin.
Move fast, Erica.
Don't let the thing drag on.
That's what I did.
It just hurts more and more.
- Get it over with.
- I don't agree with you.
There's nothing to talk about.
The son of a bitch walked out on a magnificent woman.
The son of a bitch may walk right back in in a month or two.
It sounds to me like this thing's just sexual.
Would you take Harold back if he told you he was having an affair?
Oh, hon, Harold has affairs.
He doesn't tell me about 'em.
I don't give a damn, as long as we respect each other.
That's kind of a weird contradiction, isn't it?
- My marriage isn't based on a king-sized bed.
- Neither was mine.
I know it wasn't.
There was a lot of love there.
That's why I'd hate to see it wasted if there's any hope.
- There's no hope.
- You want him back?
Would you take that miserable bastard back?
No.
- I don't think so.
- "Think"?
You have doubts?
- Of course, she has doubts.
- Look, all I know is...
I feel completely and totally alone.
- That'll pass.
- Not if she sits on it, it won't.
Depression has a way of getting nice and comfortable.
There are days I really enjoy my black moods.
- It's like curling up with a good detective story.
- Merde.
How would you know if you were never there?
Hey, honey, these old bones have known plenty of misery.
But I make it a point to get busy as soon as I feel the blues comin' on.
Oh, God.
It was so much easier in the '60s.
We had Vietnam, assassinations, the Black Panthers.
There was a hell of a lot to do.
Can even find a decent cause these days.
We could use a good war.
I could use a double vodka martini.
- Patti's so sad.
- She has a right to be.
So do you.
I'm sad, Elaine.
I'm sad.
I'm lonely.
I'm depressed.
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?
Where you goin'?
See you guys next week.
Well, let me ride home with you.
- You sure you're all right?
- I'll call you later.
I think we made her feel worse than she did.
I don't think that marriage is over yet.
I hope Martin gets a permanent case of the clap and his pecker falls off.
- Hello.
- Fuck you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I had a fight with Phil.
What about?
He was defending Daddy.
He doesn't think it was the right thing, but he understands him.
Phil's a nice boy.
- I hate Daddy.
- He didn't leave you.
He left me.
I still hate him.
You'll get over it.
I don't want to see him again.
Who you talkin' about— Phil or your daddy?
- Both of'em.
- That's crazy.
Then I'm crazy.
Okay, honey.
Oh, Mom.
- I hate him, Mom.
- Oh.
I hate him too.
Would you take him back?
Do you want him to come back?
Yeah.
I guess so.
It's over, kiddo.
For good.
You'd better get used to that, you know?
- Hello?
Hello, Phil.
No.
Yes.
Star Wars.
Mm-hmm.
No.
Nothin'.
Nothin'.
I thought we went over this?
Mm-hmm.
"Balls," said the queen.
"If I had 'em, I'd be king."
Well, if you won't sue me, Erica...
I'll tell you, uh, off the record... that you're in very good health.
- Why am I tired all the time?
- It's called divorce.
Maybe I should take Valium or something.
Come on.
We'll talk about it.
Huh?
- Did you feel this way, uh, before all this happened?
- Never.
- Never?
- Maybe I should see a psychiatrist, Arthur.
Erica, it's normal to feel lousy when a husband walks out on you.
You'd have to be crazy to feel good.
It's only been a few weeks.
Some time has to pass.
- And I'm not saying you shouldn't see a psychiatrist.
- You're just saying...
- Erica's in good health.
- Mmm.
Are you— Are you seeing other men yet?
No!
Well, don't be so shocked.
I'm not in the mood for men, Arthur.
I wasn't referring to sex.
I mean, companionship.
Oh.
Oh.
There are male companions out there who don't wanna get laid?
Well, you— Well, you could have a drink with me.
Is that a pass, Arthur?
No, it was an invitation to have a drink.
How come I never got an invitation to have a drink when I was married?
Well, I don't know.
L— I never thought about it.
It's a pass, Arthur.
A definite fucking pass.
My relationship with Hal is totally honest.
He doesn't tell me he loves me.
I don't tell him he's fascinating.
- It's pure sex.
- You always were different.
Not always.
- I've just learned to live with my ups and downs.
- I don't know how you do it.
I like my job.
I like my friends.
I like my holidays.
Oh, I'm going to the Catskills next week!
There's a new swami in town.
You wanna go?
Uh, well, my spiritual life is just fine.
What's spiritual?
There'll be some gorgeous men there.
- What does this Bob do?
- He's a press agent— Broadway shows, movies.
Hal says he's a nice guy.
- If he tries to touch me, I'll break his arms.
- Relax.
- Waiter.!
Waiter.!
Right here, pal.
These are fantastic.
These are like claws, Bob.
- Oh, yeah?
- Claw things.
- Oh, yeah.
- We'll take all four of these.
- Take 50,000 of'em, if you got 'em.
- I don't know if I can—
- What do you call these?
- Thank you.
- Claws.
- Claws.
Erica, have a claw.
Unbelievable.
Give her some of those, uh... the shrimp with the, uh—
What do you call the shrimp with the white paper on the end?
- Paper shrimp.
- Paper shrimp.
Give us some of those, okay?
- Okay, anything else?
- That's fine.
Paper shrimp.
Thank you.
Do you work, Erica?
Yeah, I, uh— I work part time at, uh—
The Rowan Gallery in Soho?
- Oh, I've never been there.
- It's a good gallery.
- We could all take a walk there later.
- That would be nice.
- Do you paint?
- No.
L— I studied painting...
- but I'm not an artist.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm in public relations.
What are you working on?
Well, right now it's a new picture about an ex-Vietnam vet... who comes back to a small Midwestern town and shoots 300 people.
- That should make a fortune.
- I think I saw it.
- I don't think so, Hal.
- I saw it, I'm telling you.
You couldn't.
They haven't made it yet.
- Sounds familiar.
- Erica.
Claire!
Hi!
- It's nice to see you.
- Remember Allison?
Hi.
How you doin'?
- Hey, I called you about a hundred times.
- Yeah.
- You're never in.
- I know.
I know.
Oh, excuse me.
This is, um, Bob.
And this is Claire and Fred and Allison and Elaine and Hal.
- Hal.
I'm Hal.
- Fred.
Nice to meet you.
- How are you?
Glad to know you.
- Can we have lunch next week?
- Yeah.
I'll call you.
- Okay.
I will.
- Want a bear claw, honey?
- Oh, she's full.
- I'm sorry, Erica.
Call us if you need anything.
- I will.
Thank you.
- Please call me.
- Yeah!
I will.
Bye-bye.
Hal, this is great.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
What are those things that would come in this little steamer here?
Waiter,can we have the shrimp with paper?
Bring a couple of Bubble-Up.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- This is crazy.
- Erica, let's take a walk.
- I feel like I've been dim-sum-ed out of my mind.
- I think I'm gonna go home.
- You sure?
- Oh, come on!
- I'll take you home.
- Stay awhile.
- No, I really wanna go home.
- Where do you live?
- You go on, Elaine.
I live in the East 60s.
- Good, I'll take you home.
- Bye.
- Well, let me take you home.
- Bye-bye!
- I'll see you later.
Call you.
- Have a nice time.
See you.
- Boy, that's a nervous lady.
- She has a right to be.
I'm divorced.
Married 11 years.
Two children.
My wife remarried.
She's living out on the island... so I get to see the kids just about every weekend.
When did you get divorced?
It's been... three years.
It was tough at first.
- You feel very disoriented.
- I know.
Yeah, Hal said you were separated?
What happened?
Oh—
My husband left me for a younger woman.
Ha, ha, ha.
He must be out of his mind.
- Are you uncomfortable?
- With you?
No.
Why did you move closer to me?
I don't know.
L—
- I guess I want to be closer to you.
- Don't, Bob!
Uh-uh!
- Why not?
- I said so, that's why.
I-I don't want you to.
- I didn't do anything!
- But you want to, don't you?
- You're paranoid.
- Do you or don't you?
What?
You'd think I was asking you to go to bed with me.
I'm just touchy these days.
I'm sorry.
You sure are.
Maybe I am being less than honest.
L—
- I'd like to see you again, Erica.
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Why not?
- You seem like a nice man.
It-It's not that.
I'm just— I'm not dating.
- Well, what was today?
- Lunch.
Well, lunch is dating in my neighborhood.
Take a girl to lunch, it's dating.
Uh, you're right.
Lunch is dating.
Oh, God. "Dating." It's a silly word.
You are a very complicated woman.
I'm crazy about you.
You son of a... bitch.!
Stop the cab!
Stop it!
You— Stop the cab!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't—
- Stop it!
Get out, you son of a bitch!
- I didn't do anything!
- Just get out!
Just stop it!
Will you stop it?
Just pull the fuck over!
Get out!
I don't want to see you!
I didn't do anything.
This is ridiculous.
Just take me home!
Wonderful.
This is a wonderful thing to come home to.
- Get out of here, Phil!
Just get out of my house!
- I'm sorry.
Out!
I don't want to talk about it.
- We didn't do anything.
- You just get out!
- We didn't do anything!
- Here's your coat.
You be quiet, Patti!
- No!
He's not going to!
- Get out of the door!
- I want him to stay!
- Mrs. Benton— Call you tomorrow!
- Patti!
- Mom, what is with you?
Look, you've got— I don't care what you want!
- You can't run my life!
- Oh, goddamn it!
- I hate it here!
I don't want to live here anymore!
- I don't want to live here, either!
- You can't stop me from seeing Phil.
I can!
I can stop you from doing anything I want!
- No, you can't!
I'll run away!
- I don't care if you run away.
What did I do that was so wrong?
Just tell me, and I'll understand.
I don't think you would act like this if your father still lived here.
Act like what?
I wasn't having an orgy or anything!
- You want me to go to the park?
- Hush!
- Get out of the house!
- Okay, I'll go to the park.
- I'll sit on a bench and do it in public.
- Okay, go ahead!
I'd like to see you!
You might as well do it in public!
- You don't have any kind of feeling about anything!
- Fine!
I'll do it!
- I don't know.
- God, what is with you?
I'm sorry.
God.
Oh, God.
It's just confusing.
L— I'm sorry I screamed at you, Patti.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
I just don't understand why you get so upset.
- I just can't be your father.
- So just be my mother!
Come here.
Come here, honey.
Call Phil and tell him I'm sorry.
Uh, tell him he can come over.
We can have an orgy.
Maybe he's got a friend for me.
How was your date?
My date?
Oh.
We had dim sum.
I was almost raped.
- He made a pass?
- Yeah.
I don't see what's wrong with that.
You're beginning to sound like my date.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Fine.
How 'bout you?
Call Phil.
Okay.
I'm— I'm afraid.
I'm frightened, you know.
- Mm-hmm.
- I've never been afraid of anything... before in my life.
When I was little, I was—
I don't know.
I was afraid of— that I was gonna get my clothes dirty, or... you know, I was gonna get bad marks on my report.
U
- U-Uhh.
I was afraid when I got my period for the first time.
You know, I— Well, I got my period... when I was, uh— when I was 13, you know.
And most of my—Well—
Some of my friends—
Well, my best friend—
My best friend was Karen Fienstein... and she got her period when she was 12, you know.
So I thought there was something wrong with me, because I didn't get my period.
So I had a terrible year from 12 to 13.
You know, I mean, I-I-I—
I thought there was really something wrong with me.
You know, every time I went to the bathroom...
I would sort of, you know,
- Check and see if I— Yeah, if I got my period yet.
- And go look.
And, suddenly I—
O
- Oh, I was wearing— I was wearing these... dumb little white lace panties... you know, that my grandmother had given me for my birthday or some—
And, um... suddenly I felt this... wet, warm feeling in my crotch, you know.
And then I—
I felt sort of excited, you know.
But then I felt afraid.
I was afraid.
I was afraid... that I was going to get blood all over the... chair... all over my pants.
Then the bell rang, and then the class got up... and then I saw Karen, you know.
And I smiled, and I winked at her, and I went like that.
And she came over, and she said, "What are you smiling about?"
And I said, "I think I got it." And she said, "Oh, thank God!"
I don't really know why I'm telling you all this.
- I mean, it doesn't really—
- Well.
Those are very scary moments, and you think a lot about that when you're a kid.
It's natural.
- And what's happening now?
- Everything seems very different.
I'm— I'm not able to... know what's gonna happen.
You know, before I had a sense that...
- life would go on, and—
- Yes.
- Now, it's like every day is like, "Whew!"
- Yeah.
What's gonna happen?
And I don't know how to control it.
- And I don't know—
- Yeah.
I don't know— I don't know what to do.
Your whole life has been disrupted, discombobulated.
And... it's a new life right now.
I mean, what can you do?
You know, you can't live my life for me, can you?
No.
No.
I certainly can't live your life for you.
It's your life.
But what I can do... is to explore it with you and see what's happening now in your life.
Yeah.
Maybe the confusion that you're feeling now... will clear up.
I'm pretty sure it will.
I think, right now, it would be a really good idea if you came twice a week.
But very quickly we'll move into once a week.
Because it's a lot more important what you do out there... than what you do in here.
Mr. Benton would like to meet there at 1:00.
Hello, Mrs. Benton.
Hi.
It's good to see you.
I'm glad you called.
Let me have your coat.
- You look terrific.
- I'm worried about Patti.
She's very angry at you.
Yeah.
Well, she's got a right to be.
I'm seeing a therapist, and I want her to see her too.
- It's expensive.
- That's all right.
- I'll-I'll take care of it.
- Good.
- Well, that's settled.
- Who's the—Who's the therapist?
Oh, her name is Tanya Berkel.
- A woman.
- I don't know any men named Tanya.
Well, that's good.
I think that's— that's good.
Good.
I glad you think it's good.
You really hate me, don't you?
- Yeah.
- I don't hate you.
- Oh, you were always a very compassionate man, Martin.
- Now, wait a minute.
L—
How— How can you hate somebody that you were in love with for 16 years?
I don't—
It's easy.
If you're trying to make me feel guiltier than I already do...
- you're doing a good job.
- Good.
This is ridiculous.
Why are we having this conversation?
Martin, do you know how many times we made love?
- No.
- No, I don't want to get into that.
I wanna tell you.
At least 2,000 times.
That's counting twice a week for 16 years.
You should put it up on your ticker tape.
I think it's a very interesting statistic.
I wanna know something.
Did you fall out of love with my— my flesh, my body... or me—with Erica?
Did you fall out of love with Erica?
Wait a minute.
I didn't fall out of love with you.
L— I love you.
I mean, all right, it-it's different now, but I—
I love you.
I can'tjust erase all those years.
- I'll always love you.
- I was your hooker, Martin.
I was a bright, high-priced, classy hooker.
Upper East Side by way of Vassar hooker... but I was your hooker.
You have a lousy shrink.
How long do you think Marcia's gonna last?
Well, I'm gonna marry her.
The awesome sanctity of marriage.
Listen, if you want to sit up here with me and have a conversation, that's great.
But if you want to have an argument, I think you'd better leave.
- I want to have an argument!
- You're flippin'.
Call Patti.
I never had any self-esteem.
That was the trouble.
I never had any self-esteem.
That was the trouble.
I suppose I thought looks would do it.
Well, I'll tell you.
It is a nice feeling to like yourself.
Bette Davis always had self-esteem.
- Oh.
- So did Katharine Hepburn.
- Mm-hmm.
- Terrific woman.
- Look at this.
- Oh.
- Beautiful.
- It's strange, isn't it?
I mean, where are all the wonderful women that were in the movies in the old days?
Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Joan Crawford.
- Where are all the women?
- Well, we've got, uh...
- Jane Fonda, Barbra Streisand.
- Oh, please.
It's not the same thing.
I'd hate to see Fonda and Streisand...
- in a toe-to-toe with Hepburn and Davis.
- Right.
- There's no contest.
- Different times.
Hi.
- Hi.
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?
- No.
- Uh-uh.
- We were wondering where all the women movie stars are... compared to 20, 30 years ago.
Well, um, I think we're getting to an age...
- where the dominate cult figure is bisexual.
- Oh, God.
- Maybe unisexual would be a more appropriate term.
You mean like Mick and Dylan and David?
- That sort of thing?
- Mm-hmm.
What's so funny?
- Is that good or bad?
- I don't know.
Nobody knows.
- You're entitled to an opinion.
- Well, I'm not bisexual, if that's what you mean.
- Yes, we know that.
- You know, but maybe she doesn't.
How'd we get started on this?
Self-esteem.
I could write a book on self-esteem.
"Self-esteem and the American Woman."
Once divorced... sleeping around, drinking too much... pretending to have a lot of self-you-know-what.
Really having next to none.
- You getting your period, Elaine?
- Sure.
But I also have no fucking confidence.
Here.
Drink this.
Why do people always give you water when you fall apart?
- I don't need water.
I need booze.
- That's a girl.
Don't worry, honey.
Aunt Elaine is just a manic-depressive.
You know, like, uh, Jekyll and Hyde?
I don't think you get enough vitamin C.
- See you guys later.
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.
- Take care.
- She's somethin' else, Erica.
- Yeah, tough cookie.
- She's confused about Martin.
- How is the son of a bitch?
Hey.
We forgot Claire Trevor.
- Jean Arthur, Susan Hayward.
- What about Greta Garbo?
That was before my time.
I liked Rita Hayworth.
She was pretty.
Everywhere I go I see... couples.
I see people holding hands or their arms around each other... cheek to cheek or—
I just feel jealous.
Oh, I have so much to say, you know, at the end of the day.
I tell Patti everything.
I think about her, you know, going away to school and—
I know it's, uh— it's a couple of years away... but I think about it as if... it's gonna happen, you know, tomorrow.
- Yes.
- L—
I guess I'm lonely.
I was very lonely too when I got divorced.
I didn't know you were divorced.
Yes.
And it's certainly okay to feel lonely.
You're supposed to in a situation like this.
It's— It's what is— what's expected.
It's really okay to feel anything— anger, jealousy... depression.
It's okay to feel.
I— I feel guilty about my feelings.
Well, guilt is something that I get livid about... because it's kind of a man-made emotion.
And, uh...
I would like to see you... take a vacation from guilt.
Stop feeling guilty for one week.
Just-Just say, "Erica, turn off the guilt."
Just turn it off.
Don't feel guilty.
It doesn't get you anywheres.
It really prolongs the agony.
And—
- I know what you mean.
I'll try.
- Yeah.
And don't feel guilty about feeling guilty, either.
And don't feel ashamed of your feelings.
They're your feelings.
They have no I.Q.
They have no morality.
They're your feelings.
Just feel 'em.
When were you divorced?
I was divorced three years ago.
But let's get back to you and loneliness.
When you were married, did you ever feel lonely?
- No, not really.
No.
- When you were married, did you feel lonely?
Never?
No.
Well, sometimes, but I wasn't scared then, you know?
This scares me.
It is scary.
It's a whole new way of life.
Did you ever find yourself wanting to be alone?
Yes!
But I knew it wasn't gonna be forever.
Does it feel to you as if this is gonna be forever— the way you feel now?
Well...
I haven't had sex for seven weeks.
It's been seven weeks since Martin left.
I always took sex for granted.
Are you feeling sexy these days?
Hardly.
And, uh—
- What was I saying?
- Sex.
Oh, yes.
I was hoping you'd forgotten.
Um... well, we just had a pretty good sex life, you know.
I just— It was very—
This isn't fun.
No.
I just—
- I enjoyed sex.
It was— It was nice.
- Mm-hmm.
We were pretty... wild, Martin and me.
Mm-hmm.
Tell me what you mean by that.
Wha-What do you mean, you were pretty wild?
Well, we had a good sex life.
What exactly was it like?
Jesus!
What do you think happened?
What happens?
You sound pretty angry.
What's that all about?
If I knew that, I wouldn't be here.
Well, what are you gonna do about it?
You're looking at me as if I have the answers.
I don't have the answer for you.
I can tell you what I would do... if I were me and I were in your situation.
What?
Well, one thing, I'd do a lot of what you're doing already.
I'd be a— I'd spend a lot of time with my friends... as you're doing.
And I'd also sort of take myself by the hand... and say, "Come on, Tanya.
Get into the stream of life.
"Get back in there.
"Don't be scared of going out with guys.
Let's open the door and walk out and get in the stream of life."
- Men, huh?
- Yeah, men.
I'd risk it.
I'd risk it with some new men.
They're people, you know.
I think you could enjoy them.
Take a chance.
Yeah.
I guess I should.
Ugh.
- Can I help you?
- I'll have a glass of white wine, please.
Two beers, Tom.
- Erica!
- Hi!
- Come, join us.
- Okay.
It's good to see you.
Erica Benton, Edward Thoreaux.
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.
Erica works over at the Rowan.
Oh, really?
I haven't seen the new show.
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it.
Edward just got back from a year in Rome.
He's a painter.
How was Rome?
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it.
I loved it.
How are you, Erica?
Oh, I'm a little weird these days.
- I'm getting divorced.
- Ah, I'm surprised.
- Why?
- You seem like such a normal person.
Compared to me, that is.
It's the normal people who are getting divorced.
Nobody else bothers to get married.
If I got married every time I thought it was serious, I would be in lots of trouble.
How are you?
The work I'm doing is nice.
Edward and I are definitely an item.
- So life is good.
- One hates to be thought of as an item.
Hey, what's happening, babe?
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Jean, how ya doin'?
- Hi.
My name is Edward Thoreaux.
- Charlie.
Nice to see you.
- How do you do?
- Were you slumming?
- I wasn't up till now.
What does she want from me?
There's a party at Tom Whalen's loft.
Do you want to come?
Tom Whalen?
You mean the guy who paints the turtles?
- Yeah.
- I pass.
Thanks.
- Erica?
- I don't think so.
It was nice to meet you.
Arrivederla.
Arrivederla, my ass.
Listen, what are you doing out by yourself?
Where's honey?
- We're getting divorced.
- No shit?
What happened?
He was buying a shirt in Bloomingdale's, and he fell in love.
- Am I supposed to be sorry or what?
- No.
- Buy me another glass of wine, Charlie.
- Be right back.
Take me to your loft, Charlie.
Well, you want a cup of coffee?
Something to eat?
- Uh-uh.
- A bottle of Chianti in the kitchen.
Charlie, let's just do it, okay?
Now, before I change my mind.
Okay, okay.
Let's just get something straight right off the top, babe, huh?
I don't get involved with my women.
I'm a short-term guy.
I don't fall in love.
I don't wanna get married.
- Right.
- The only thing you can count on me for is sex.
I am what I am.
I make no bones about it.
Charlie, I'm very nervous.
Your talking is just making me more nervous.
Okay.
- You havin' trouble?
- Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Here.
Here.
Wait.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Just a second!
You got your thing caught.
- My necklace is in it.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
Careful.
There we go.
Oh, what a disaster!
Cheer up, will ya?
Yeah.
Ahh.
The maiden!
Delightful.
Delightful.
Will you stop actin' like some kind of virgin, huh?
Yoo-hoo?
Miss?
Yo.!
Ah, here you are.
Hi.
Charlie, I've only slept with one man in 17 years.
Jesus, I was wrong.
I could've sworn you've had a few affairs.
Oh, man, what a beautiful body.
Come here.
Cheer up, will ya?
This is your party.
I'm a little embarrassed.
- When does she stop?
- Ow!
What happened?
An injury.
- What's the matter?
- A splinter.
- Where?
- In my toe.
A splinter in the toe?
The foot doctor's here.
Let me see.
Let me see.
First we'll have to remove the outer garments.
Oh, yes.
Ah, what a lovely piece of equipment.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Huh.
You like that, huh?
You like that, don't you?
Your turn, baby.
Hmm?
You gonna turn me on?
- That was nice.
Very nice.
- I have to go.
I'll see you tomorrow night, okay?
- No.
- What's the matter?
You mad at me?
- No.
- Come back tomorrow night.
- Uh-uh.
- Why not?
I don't fall in love, Charlie.
I'm a— I'm a short-term guy.
I'll tell you one thing.
Your ex-old man's a fuckin' asshole.
Good night, Charlie.
Hi.
Wait a minute.
I want to talk to you.
- Call me.
- Hey, come on.
Hey, you wanna give me a heart attack or what?
Jesus, Martin!
What do you want?
Well, I just wanted to tell you that I had a nice talk with Patti.
- She's okay.
- I know.
How are you?
I got laid last night.
- Remember Billy Higgins?
- Uh-uh.
Yeah, you do.
He's that big, tall, blond guy, worked for Merrill Lynch.
- Tennis player.
About my age.
- Right, right.
Yeah.
He had a heart attack last week.
He dropped dead.
- That's too bad.
- You look good.
Would you try to have a linear conversation, Martin?
Look, wait a minute.
I just want us to be friends.
I mean, if not for my sake, then for Patti's.
I don't wanna be your friend!
- What the hell do you want me to do?
- Just leave me alone.
Well, Billy was supposed to go out to L.A.
- Now they want me to take his spot.
- Take it.
- Well, it means I'd have to move out there.
- Good.
If I do go out, can Patti come out and spend some time with me?
You'll have to ask Patti.
Herbert, what do you think?
It looks a little high on the right to me.
High on the right.
Hmm.
What do you think?
I
- I think the whole thing is too high.
I like it where it is.
Ifyoulikeditwhereitis, then why did you ask me?
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Where would you like to go for dinner?
I can't, Saul.
My daughter's coming home from school.
We're eating at home.
- Well, give her a call.
Tell her to join us.
- No!
- Well, she doesn't have to know I'm your lover.
- You're not my lover.
Well, uh— You, you know what I mean.
I'm not very good at hiding my feelings, Saul.
What are your feelings?
Well, I— I just slept with a man that I barely know.
- I mean, casual sex is not my—
- No, no.
- I-I don't—
- No, it's not— I don't sleep with every woman I meet.
I'm experimenting.
I'm— Well, I know it sounds a little cold... but that's... the way it is these days.
I just want to see how it feels to make love to someone that I'm not in love with.
How does it feel?
Sort of empty.
Well, at least you're honest.
The sex was very good.
You're a very nice man.
You have a bizarre way of handing out a compliment.
It was the best I could do.
Why did you flirt with me at the gallery?
I think it was mutual.
Ah, silly games we play.
There's no need for them, you know.
- Do you want to know how I really feel?
- Yes, I do.
As soon as the sex was over, I wanted to leave.
- That's very hostile.
- I don't feel hostile.
I like you.
Perhaps you'd better go home.
I'm getting a very big headache.
My husband used to get headaches whenever I didn't want to have sex.
Poor bugger must have had migraines.
- You-You got a coat?
- Yeah.
I'll see you later.
- Behave yourselves, ladies.
- Oh, yeah?
- We'll try.
- I'm always good.
Just show me the bar.
- Ah.
- That did it.
I've gotta go home pretty soon.
- Hello, Erica.
- Hi, Edward.
Nice to see you.
- These are my friends.
This is Elaine Liebowitz.
- How do you do?
- Edward Thoreaux.
And Sue Miller.
- How do you do?
- And Jeannette Lewin.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Erica.
- Can I take your coats?
- You look wonderful!
- Thanks.
I'm Jean Starret.
Erica has told me about your, uh, club.
This is Jeannette and Elaine and Sue.
- What club?
- Do you know anything about consciousness raising?
- Not really.
- Neither do we.
Wejust kind of get together once a week and complain a lot.
- That's very American.
- Aren't you an American?
I'm from Cleveland, but I try to forget it.
- I was hoping you'd show up.
- How's your headache?
I had it ever since you left.
How's the party?
Usual.
Well, whenever you put about 50 artists together in one room... you get a really pleasant combination... of gossip, paranoia, envy, fear, trembling... hatred, lust and pretense.
It's, uh, wonderful.
Tell me some good gossip.
Good gossip, eh?
Hmm.
Oh.
You see the short, wiry fellow in the corner?
The one with his arm around Lady MacBeth?
Well, his name is Conrad Zweiback.
He's Hungarian.
Very intense.
Very ambitious.
- Can't paint for shit.
- Who's the woman?
She's the wife of Henry Gebhart, the critic.
- Oh, I've never met him.
- Oh, he's a spider.
Sets traps for young artists, using his wife as bait.
- Is he gay?
- Oh, no.
No, not at all.
That would make sense.
No, it appears he likes to watch his wife make love to other men.
Now, if the other man is pleasing to Lady MacBeth... he becomes the new discovery of Gebhart.
- How do you know all this?
- I was discovered by Henry Gebhart.
I'm kidding.
No, but it's true.
The story's true.
- You're very beautiful tonight.
- You look very good yourself.
Shall we dance?
You're full of surprises.
Remember, we don't really know each other.
- Tanya!
- Erica!
- How great to see you here.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm an old friend ofJean Starret's.
- Ohh.
And I'd like to have you meet my friend, Sophie Windham.
- Hello.
- Erica Benton.
Uh, this is Saul Kaplan.
Tanya Berkel.
- Hi, Saul.
- Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- And we're looking around forJean, so we'll go along.
- I think she's back there.
- Okay, but I see something to eat in there, so we'll go in there.
- Okay.
- See you later.
Have fun.
- Who was that woman?
- Oh, that was no woman.
That was my therapist.
- Having a good time?
- Yeah.
You?
- Hey, what do you say, babe?
- Charlie!
God.
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah.
Charlie tells me he's a great artist.
Uh, this is Elaine, and this is Jeannette.
- Hello.
- This is Charlie.
- Hello.
- This is Saul Kaplan.
Saul Kaplan?
The Saul Kaplan?
Oh, let me get over there.
Hey, this is a real honor.
I mean, really!
Hey, I bow at your feet, man.
Now, this guy's a real fucking artist.
Thank you.
You may rise.
- Thank you.
- You're drunk, Charlie.
Yes, and stoned.
Great combo.
- Is he dangerous?
- Oh, ask her if I'm good, babe.
- Shut up, Charlie.
Jesus!
- Ohhh, we really got it on one night.
I mean, dynamite.
And she slams the door in my face.
What did I do to deserve such a rotten fate?
I balled my ass off;
the lady won't see me again.
- It's getting to be a '60's party.
- What, is it raining?
What happened?
What happened?
- Why don't you go home, Charlie.
- Why don't you fuck off!
- I'll wipe the floor with you.
- Up yours!
- Come on.
Let's leave.
- No, no.
No.
He leaves.
We stay.
Oh, I get it.
You're ballin' her too.
If you don't mind your dumb fuckin' manners—
I thought you were gonna kill him.
No, I wouldn't give the bastard the satisfaction.
If he made the front page of the Daily News, he'd end up famous.
His work is good, actually.
I was surprised.
Well, you can be a bastard and have talent.
Where'd you see his work, eh?
His place.
You disappointed in me?
I don't know you well enough to be disappointed in you.
But if you ever do it again, I'll kill you.
You're a strange man.
No, I'm a simple man really.
Got very simple tastes.
I like Titian, Rembrandt, Botticelli, Kojak...
Camembert cheese... expensive shoes—
I have bad feet—
London, Vermont, New York about half the time.
And being madly in love.
And I've been without that for a long time now.
What's so funny, eh?
What the hell are you laughing at, eh?
I bare my soul, and you laugh at me.
What is it?
You stepped in dog shit!
I think this is poodle shit.
Oh, yes, after a while, you can tell one kind from another.
I can even tell the difference between an East Side dog... an uptown dog and a Village dog.
Now, East Side dogs shit only the best... and Village dogs shit art.
In London, they don't shit at all, you know.
I don't think they're allowed to, no, no.
In London, I think they have an underground passage where all the dogs shit.
I was born in London, you know.
My mother and my father had a shop near Stepney Green.
That's the Lower East Side of London.
One day when I was about six, my parents had a row, you know.
My mother, she threw a pickled herring at my dad, and it, uh, missed.
Splattered all against the wall.
I took one look at that pickled herring... and that's when I decided to become an abstract expressionist.
Your work does remind me of pickled herring.
Mmm.
Hey, I want to know about that man you lived with.
Were you passionate with each other?
- You mean sexually?
- I mean in every way.
Well, we were married for a very long time.
- Well, I was married for nine years.
- Really?
Eight of those years were very passionate.
Well, "passion's" a mild word for it, really.
It's—Well, it was more like war.
How did your marriage end?
Not with a whimper, but with a bang.
Matilda— Her name is Matilda—
She wrote poetry for her soul, and she swam a hundred laps a day for her body.
Now, this was after we had the two children.
- Boys?
- My son is 12.
My daughter's nine.
Well, one day I came home, and I found her in bed... with a high diver from the local pool.
- Oh, God.
- I wanted to kill the poor sap, but something kept me from it.
- What?
- He was about seven feet tall.
Oh, you know something?
L—
I wasn't angry.
I felt relief, really.
I was glad it was over— for both of us!
Well, I wasn't a very good husband.
My work means everything to me.
I don't think I believe that.
Don't you miss your children?
I love them.
Sometimes I miss them.
But I see them every summer.
We have a place up in Vermont.
You'll like it.
You seem to have my life worked out for me.
For us.
I want you.
- You know that?
- Yes, I'm getting the message.
Do you want me?
My head tells me to slow down.
But I don't think my pulse is normal.
You know, there are three things that we could do right now.
You could call a taxi and go home.
Or we could go on walking, and, uh, I could lecture you... on the real dilemma of modern art.
Or we could go to my place, and we could thoroughly enjoy each other.
You want hot sauce on your eggs?
Please.
- Grated cheese?
- Everything.
I feel great.
I feel... happy.
I
- I don't know what's going on.
This is craziness.
I don't understand anything anymore.
I feel— I like to do things, you know.
- I want to travel.
- We'll travel.
I want to see Greece.
I want to see Persia.
I'd like to go to Tibet.
I'd like to open up a little restaurant.
Nothing fancy.
Just a little something where I sing under a spotlight.
You ever thought about skateboarding?
I do want to go to India!
India I can do without.
Why?
I like a nice bathroom.
I may go back to school.
I may go back to school.
What's wrong with the gallery?
Oh, I need more money.
I don't want to depend on Martin forever.
Also, I could use a real challenge in my work.
Live with me.
That'd be a real challenge.
I could use a challenge in my work.
Living with me is work.
Hey, this is really delicious.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Does it still feel empty?
No, but it tastes like hot sauce.
Why do you only have one child?
Do you want to have a child?
No, no, no.
Well, I had two miscarriages after Patti.
I quit trying.
Why?
Because...
I want to know everything there is to know about you.
Mm.
Paint!
Paint!
Paint!
Please, paint!
- You are the most delicious woman I've ever met!
- I have to go.
- There's something so damn Victorian about you!
Will you ever, ever spend the whole day... followed by the whole night with me in this room?
I don't know!
Look, I'll come over to your place if it's any easier.
There's just something so nice about sleeping... and waking up with a person that you like.
You really know how to rush a girl, don't you?
You really know how to rush a girl, don't you?
Erica, underneath this haunted, driven shell of a man... there lives a warm homebody... who likes to watch TV and chew cashews... while the woman he loves is finishing a good novel.
Sounds like my marriage.
I want to meet your daughter.
- Now?
- Whenever.
Come to dinner tomorrow night.
Don't know the address.
I like your style.
A girl in my school got an abortion last week.
- How old is she?
- Sixteen.
- It's not that unusual.
- Do I know her?
Mm-mm.
Cost 200 bucks.
She said it was awful too.
The doctor kissed her on the mouth right after the abortion.
- Oh, God!
- Two hundred bucks!
What about her parents?
Do they know?
- No way!
- Well, who paid for it?
We all chipped in.
- What about the boy?
- She was too embarrassed to ask him.
That stinks.
- Here comes Casanova.
- Oh, I'm warning you.
- I'm warning you.
- Shake it.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- All right?
- Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Come in.
This is Patti Benton.
Saul Kaplan.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I saw one of your paintings in the Museum of Modern Art.
Oh?
Did you like it?
I didn't understand it.
- Hmm.
Well, I'm gonna like you.
- She never lies.
How old are you?
- Forty-two.
- You don't look it.
- You look older.
- Patti!
- How old do I look?
- I already know.
You're 15.
- Do I look it?
- You look much older.
Good.
- Can I have some?
- With dinner.
Give her half a glass.
Cut it with water.
- Yeah, that's what the French do.
- We're not French.
Booze is worse than grass.
I smoke grass once in a while.
- So do I.
- Got any?
Now, don't be precocious, Patti.
I'm not being precocious.
I'm just a normal 15-year-old girl.
Actually, I'm not normal.
I'm still a virgin.
Patti, come into the kitchen with me.
Excuse us.
- You're being very rude!
- I guess I'm just nervous.
- This is the first time you've brought a man home.
- Do you like him?
It's too early to tell.
He's cute.
This is—This is really delicious.
Your mother's a very good cook.
How can you tell from one dish?
She made eggs for me the other night.
With hot sauce and grated cheese?
- That's right.
- Hmph.
She really likes you then.
I don't think I'm having fun at this party.
I am.
Relax.
I know that you and Saul are lovers.
It's not funny.
What's the matter?
You always told me to tell the truth.
It's obvious that you invited Saul here to prepare me.
Prepare you for what?
Um, look, I'm the one who asked to come here.
- I wanted to meet you.
- I have a father.
I don't want to be your father.
I'm not marrying Saul.
L—
- Marry him!
I don't care!
- He's my friend.
So marry him.
It doesn't matter to me.
Nobody's asking you to stop loving your father.
Well, you know, it would be easier if Daddy could see me here sometimes.
Okay.
Sorry.
I behaved like a 15-year-old.
I do it all the time.
# Maybe I'm a man Maybe I'm a lonely man #

Good morning.
Hi.
How come you're not jogging?
Oh, I had an early appointment with this guy.
What's, uh—What's up?
Well, I've decided that you can come to the apartment... to see Patti whenever you want.
- Oh, good.
I'm glad.
- Just call first.
Okay.
Oh, I meant to tell you.
I'm not going to California now.
- Why?
- Oh, a lot of things.
Mostly, no money.
Well, you know, I've, uh— I've stopped seeing my therapist, and... well, I'm looking around for a better job, so... the money thing will be a lot easier for you.
We could make it real easy if you want to.
What do you mean?
Well, I broke up with Marcia.
I'm surprised.
Yeah, I am too, kind of.
Well, the truth of it is she left me.
I don't know.
I mean, the minute I moved in there, we stopped having fun.
It's craziness.
I'm sorry.
Are you really?
Yeah, I'm sorry for you.
- I want to come back.
- No.
- Will you think about it?
- No, Martin.
I mean, I was thinkin' you could think of me... as this guy who was sick for a long time, you know, and then recovered.
Think you could do that?
It doesn't work that way, you know?
Yeah.
Patti said you have a boyfriend.
Yeah.
We're goin' steady.
Well, I'll call you.
Bye.
Bye, Martin.
Patti's gonna have to spend more time alone.
Oh, she can cope with that.
Yeah.
I worry about her.
I have to.
I have to.
- You don't have to.
- I do.
I have enough money for both of us.
I don't want your money, Saul.
Look, I'd take your money, if I needed it... and if you had it.
But, you—you're an artist.
Oh, yes.
What's Patti doing this summer?
Oh, she wants to go to summer school.
Well, you know what would be nice— what would be very nice indeed— would be if both of you came up to Vermont... for the whole of the summer.
I can't leave the gallery.
I can't.
He'd let you go for the summer.
Well, maybe for a week, but not for the whole summer.
- It's very beautiful.
- Oh.
Want one?
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, um, one lemon, please.
- Make it two.
- I'm sorry.
No lemon.
Vanilla.
- Okay.
That's all right.
- Fine.
Good.
- Your children will be there, won't they?
- Yes, they certainly will!
Yes.
Well, we'd have a lot of fun.
- Madame.
- Fine.
I can't.
You keep saying you can't.
How much are these, please?
- Twenty cents each, please.
- Twenty cents each.
- "I can't."
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Well, I can't.
- Oh, you can.
What am I gonna do up there?
Watch you paint?
Go fishing?
Go swimming?
Well, it sounds nice, doesn't it?
Ah, yeah.
I'll come up for a couple of weekends.
Life is very complicated.
I've been on vacation for 16 years.
Oh, look, listen.
I-I know you want to get out on your own.
And I approve.
I wouldn't try to stop you.
- What do you mean, you approve?
- What?
- I don't understand that word.
Why are you saying you approve?
- Oh, look.
- I'm not doing this for your approval, you know.
- No, listen.
Let me finish.
- No, that's really not what I have on my mind.
- Please.
All I meant was—
- I hate that.
- Yes.
All I meant was that if—
Well, spending a few weeks with someone you like— that's not out of line.
How do you know?
How can you say that?
How do you know what I need, what I want to do for myself?
I think we need a marriage counselor.
Why don't you come back here every weekend?
Because if I stop painting for a few days...
I may stop painting altogether.
Do you really believe that?
Absolutely.
Men!
Women.
You know what I did yesterday?
I threw out a whole new jar of blackberry jam.
Martin loved blackberry jam.
I think the problem was that I didn't do things as myself, you know.
I did things as this—
Martin and Erica, Martin and Erica.
It wasn't his fault.
L— I liked it.
Saul and Erica will be different from Martin and Erica.
- You want to see other women?
- I want you!
- You're free to.
- I don't want to.
Then don't.
Do you want to see other men?
Not today.
I'm getting a headache.
I have to go back to work.
So do I.
Would you rather go back to bed?
Mm-hmm.
Yes?
This thing needs oil.
See, I'm gonna put those pillows, you know, from the sofa around there.
- Mm-hmm.
- Carpet.
- Has a lot of outlets.
- Yeah, a lot of outlets.
Ta-da!
Another fireplace!
It's nice, isn't it?
- I can afford it.
- Then take it.
I don't know what to do with Saul, you know.
He wants me to go to Vermont.
He goes there for five months!
- Then don't take it.
- You're a lot of help.
Why don't I go to Vermont?
You stay here, work your ass off and be sensible.
I'll go pick berries and dance in the woods with Saul.
It's confusing, Elaine.
Since I started taking Lithium, I feel more sensible than this month's Good Housekeeping.
No more black, moody lows.
But I sure as hell miss my highs.
- You want my advice?
- Yeah.
Do you know how rare a man like Saul is?
You know how many jerks there are out there?
He's smart.
He's funny.
- Is he a good lover?
- Eh.
Start packin', honey.
I finally settled down.
I gotta tell you this.
Oh, it's crazy.
It's okay, honey.
It's really okay.
You're looking very beautiful.
But you're traveling awfully light.
How do you pack pickled herring?
I'll definitely come up for holidays.
Do you know what it's like up there in the woods all alone?
- Paint.
- Hmm.
Perhaps I'll find some nice, warm moose to keep me company.
Am I only a sexual object to you?
No.
No, you're a bright, willful, curious woman... who is also a sexual object.
I hope it's the hottest... muggiest, most miserable summer on record.
You're so damn stubborn!
I'm not.
I'm really not.
Come with me, for Christ's sake!
I can't.
- Independent.
- Trying to be.
Woman.
- Vicious.
- No.
Honest.
You're driving me crazy.
Okay, Mario, I've got it!
- Will you hold this a minute?
- Yeah.
- Have you got it?
- I got it.
- Bye.
- What about this?
- Oh, that's for you.
- How the hell am I gonna get it home?
Take a taxi.
Jesus Christ!
Look at this.
My sneaker's ruined!
- They're only $35.
- Fucking city's turned into one big pile of dog shit!
Come on out and take a crap on me!
Everybody else is!
Fuck.
- Give it back to the poodles.
- What's the point of jogging for two and a half miles?
Giving yourself lung cancer.
Tell you somethin', Erica.
The longer I'm married to you... the more you sound like my mother.
Clean your own sneaker.
- You wanted me to step in it.
- You're going crazy, Martin.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Why would I want you to step in dog shit?
Well, that's a good question.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not your mother.
- You know.
- Yeah.
Listen, do you think we got time for a little quickie?
I got about 11 minutes.
Hey, come on!
Gimme a break here.
I'm gettin' frostbite.
Jesus, I got to quit smoking.
- I saw Jacobs on Tuesday.
Did I tell you?
- Uh-uh.
Yeah, I went in for my annual physical.
How are you?
Fine.
You sound surprised.
Well, you know, I go up there for the damn thing... and my blood pressure goes up 20 points from the anxiety of having to take the exam.
- What are you doing today?
- Working at the gallery.
Oh, yeah.
Goin'to school.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
Hmm.
Did the earth move?
Bye.
I'm telling you, we expose that kid to too much.
- Well, we still lock the door.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Have a good time.
See you tonight.
- Mm-hmm.
"Tonight, the ballet world was introduced...
"to a brilliant new talent—
"the long-awaited debut of Erica Benton.
"Miss Benton astounded the ballet world last night... in her incredible performance of Swan Lake. "
"Her pas de deux were breathtaking."
- Hello.
- Hi.
There she is.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are you?
- You look great.
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.
You're just in time for some big news.
- Well.
- Oh, hi.
Uhhh.
- Wine.
- Let's have a glass— another carafe.
Okay?
- Yeah.
And, uh...
- Anything else?
- Steamer Vic.
- Refills for everybody.
- Are you ready?
- You're in love.
Would that I were.
It's not my news.
- Sue.
- The only thing that happened to me last week was... my elevator man got arrested for flashing.
- What is it, Jeannette?
- I met a man.
Well, that's terrific!
- Well, there's a little problem.
- He's married.
No.
- He's very young.
- You're not close.
- How young?
- He's 19.
- Oh, Jesus.
- I know.
I know.
- He's very mature.
- Nineteen?
The problem is:
Does she fuck him, or does she adopt him?
I'm a terrible person.
I'm drunk, and I'm giddy, and I'm going to the loo.
- Sorry, Jeannette.
- It's okay.
I think Elaine's going through early menopause.
It is so ironic.
I've dated so many men... in the last few years that were my age or older... and Steven— his name is Steven— is the first man that I've really liked...
- since my divorce.
- Well, what's he like?
He's calm, quiet.
He doesn't come on.
He's very bright.
He's not afraid to be tender.
Well, if you were a man and you were talking about a 19-year-old girl... then there would be no problem, would there?
No, I worry about Teddy.
I mean, how do you tell a six-year-old child his new daddy is a teenager?
- Where does he live now?
- With his parents.
Maybe I should adopt him.
Did I miss anything?
No.
It's just that last night was so incredible.
I put Teddy to bed, and Steven came over.
We just sat and talked all night long.
- I mean, till 7:00 this morning.
- What did you talk about?
We talked a lot about loneliness.
- Got kind of emotional.
- Then?
- Promise you won't laugh?
- I promise.
Well, then he undressed me, and he gave me a massage.
And it was the most incredible experience I think I've ever had in my life.
- I'll bet.
- Was it sexual?
That's it.
It was and it wasn't.
I mean, he massaged my feet and my toes... and he massaged my fingers.
He massaged my eyes.
He actually massaged my eyes.
And then I had an orgasm.
And then another and then another.
I'd say it was sexual.
There ain't nothin' wrong with a good, old-fashioned eyeball orgasm.
Oh, I love them.
I mean, I couldn't live without them.
- Have you read the latest book?
- No, I didn't.
- You think I'm going crazy.
- Crazy?
What's this boy's phone number?
- Don't be offended, okay?
- No.
What?
What?
- Is he being honest with you?
- That's pretty naive, Erica.
- No, it isn't.
- No, it's not.
There's no such thing as total honesty... not with men.
They're all wrapped up in sexual ego.
- What the hell is sexual ego, Elaine?
- Never getting enough.
Always on the make.
Constantly worried about performing.
That's ridiculous.
I know lots of men who are interested in other things besides sex.
- Name one.
- My husband.
Harold hasn't made a pass in six months.
Well, listen, Elaine.
Don't you think you're taking this thing a little too far?
Me?
No.
- I think you're getting to be a man-hater.
- I love men!
We're talking about their honesty.
- Do you think Martin is totally honest?
- I don't think about it.
I think Erica has the second-best man in the five boroughs.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, I'm sure.
I think what I'm gonna do is just go along with things the way they are...
- and just see what happens.
- Have fun, honey.
The worst that can happen is that it'll end.
No, I think the worst that could happen is that his parents will find out.
You're fabulous.
- I love you.
- Swiftly moving on.
Patti?
Hello?
Hi.
- Girls had a long meeting tonight, huh?
- They're not meetings.
- What's on the news?
- Nothin'.
They're shootin' up Rhodesia, and, uh, the garbagemen are raising' hell again.
You know.
Jeannette is having an affair with a 19-year-old boy.
Oh, shit.
She's flipped.
Men go out with younger women all the time.
Nineteen is four years older than Patti.
Yeah, where is Patti?
She went to the movies with Phil.
- I like Phil.
- Well, maybe Phil should meet Jeannette.
- Martin.
- How are Elaine and Sue?
- Fine.
- Elaine makes me very nervous.
- She likes you.
- Yeah.
I like her all right.
She just comes on too strong.
So do you sometimes.
Sometimes I get the feeling that you prefer Elaine and Sue and Jeannette to me.
That's ridiculous, Martin.
- Do you?
- Sometimes.
Look, Martin.
Patti's coming home.
I have to get up early.
Martin, I'm not in the mood.
You give me a headache.
- Take an aspirin.
- Shit.
Anybody home?
We're in here, honey.
What's goin' on in there?
Want me to go out and come in again?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How was the movie?
- Good.
We saw the new Lina Wertmüller film.
- Yeah?
Did you like it?
- I loved it.
But Phil thought it was flawed.
How old is Phil again?
You know how old he is.
Why?
Well, your mother's friend Jeannette is having an affair with a 19-year-old guy.
- Good for her.
- Yeah?
- Would Phil go out with Jeannette?
- I don't know.
You'd have to ask Phil.
Don't say anything about Jeannette.
Who am I gonna tell?
- You and Daddy fighting?
- No, it's not a fight.
- Daddy doesn't look too happy.
- Mmm!
- Good night.
- Good night.
Jesus.
You're acting like a five-year-old kid.
- I know.
I know.
- It's wonderful when you're in the mood and I'm in mood.
But, God!
It's not much fun when you make me feel like it's an obligation.
I know.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Besides, we had sex this morning.
What do you want?
Guess I'm not much fun to live with, am I?
Are you okay?
- I don't know.
- What is it?
I don't know.
I just... find myself—
I just— I'm anxious all the time, you know.
About what?
I just— I'm fantasizing and—
- About what?
- Uhh.
About changing my life.
Quit Wall Street, go be a disc jockey somewhere.
I don't know.
- Tired of your job?
- I'll tell you something.
I've been the takeover type all my life.
I mean, in school, in the navy... probably with you, certainly with Patti.
- There's nothing wrong with being a strong man.
- That's the point.
- I'm not a strong man.
I don't feel like a strong man.
- You are!
Well, I feel tired.
I don't know what to say.
You should see a psychiatrist.
Really.
I
- I don't think so.
Is it me?
Are you tired of me?
I love you.
Aww.
I'd hate to join the crowd.
Why?
What do you mean?
Oh, Elaine's boozing a lot.
Jeannette's crazy.
Sue's okay.
She's a strong woman.
- God.
- Well, so are you.
I'm beginning to wonder about me.
Oh, it's so nice to have a man to come home to.
- Is that just luck?
- Yeah.
It's luck and a fabulous body.
Jesus.
Here, three kids in the sixth grade beat their teacher up.
Where?
The Bronx.
- You never have any trouble in school, do you?
- No.
It's a jungle.
It is!
They got guys carrying guns.
Oh, you read too much.
- I what?
- It doesn't really happen that way.
Well, it doesn't happen where you go to school, because we got you in a pretty good school.
- It's costing me a lot of money.
- Oh, I'll go to public school.
- Okay.
You're on.
- Okay.
- You think that's funny?
- We'll buy you a gun, send you to public school.
- I'm sorry.
I'm getting tickets to the ballet a week from Friday.
Do you want to go?
- I don't know.
Let me ask Phil.
- Phil can come with us.
Only if he pays.
- I don't think Phil likes ballet.
- I don't either.
I'm goin'.
Good for your soul.
No.
I think I'll pass, Mom.
- Listen, am I a nagging father?
- No.
You're just feeling the loss of separation.
I'm not your little girl anymore.
Wash your mouth with soap!
- Hey, no physical contact, please!
- Got to go.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Do you think Daddy's worried about getting old?
- Are you taking a psych course this year?
- Mm-hmm.
He's always joking.
Never seems to take anything seriously, you know.
You mean, he doesn't take Phil seriously, and that bothers you.
No, it doesn't.
I don't take Phil that seriously either.
Oh, I think you're serious about Phil.
Mom, I'm still a virgin, if that's what you meant.
It's not what I meant.
But I'm glad you told me.
- I just meant that you like Phil.
- I like Phil.
I'm not gonna marry him.
I'm never getting married.
- You will.
- Don't be so sure.
- Why not?
- Why should I?
Everybody I know who's married is either miserable or divorced.
- I don't want that.
- Oh, Patti.
That's ridiculous!
- There's a lot of happily married couples.
- Name three.
- Uhh.
- Uh.
- I'll have to think about it.
- Yeah.
See you later.
383 West Broadway, please.
Now, if all this stuff wasn't done by a woman...
I don't think you could sit in the same room with it.
It isn't "stuff," Charlie.
It happens to be art.
You're a classic male chauvinist pig.
I know, but I'm cute.
- You're out of style, Charlie.
- Want a bite?
Uh-uh.
You're a beautiful woman, Erica.
- But you're leading such a sheltered life.
- How can you tell?
It's in your eyes.
You can tell everything in a woman's eyes.
Oh.
Can you tell everything in a man's eyes?
Men cover it up.
Women lay it all on the line.
Right there in the old eyes.
What do you see in my eyes, Charlie?
- Want me to be honest?
- Yeah.
You're not gettin' enough.
I think you ought to have your eyes examined.
Oh, no.
No, you're not really satisfied.
I mean, your old man's okay and all that, but, uh... underneath it all you're frustrated.
Go paint a still life, Charlie.
- You ever had an affair?
- It's none of your business.
Oh, man.
What a shame.
What a waste!
A woman as beautiful as you should be tasting a little variety in life.
Imagine if all you ever ate was apples?
Imagine never tasting a peach or a pear?
Apapaya?
Huh?
No way, babe.
Same thing with sex.
I'm allergic to papayas, Charlie.
How about a nice, fresh guava?
Huh?
- Huh?
- Leave me alone.
- Don't you ever think about anything else, Charlie?
- Yeah, like what?
Ohh, there's literature and ballet...
- and theater and dance...
- Hey, hey, hey, Erica.
- And architecture—
- Erica.
Hey, listen.
There's work, there's food, and there's sex.
That's the whole ball game.
Rowan Gallery.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
I'll meet you.
Um, 15 minutes.
Okay, honey.
Bye.
Might I inquire as to who "honey" is?
My husband.
I'm meeting him for lunch.
Well...
- think I'll hit the streets for awhile.
- Bye, Charlie.
- Hi.
- Is this together?
Uh, yeah, he's paying for me.
That'll be $3.95.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Mmm, I wanted to talk to you about something.
I think that if we're gonna go to the island this summer... that we really ought to get on it right away.
How would you feel about sharing a place with Sue and Harold?
- How's the market?
- Huh?
Just wanted to see if you were paying any attention to me.
- You want to share a place with Sue and Harold.
- Think you could handle it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Well, I'll talk to Sue, and maybe the four of us could drive out in a couple of weeks.
We really should get on it right away.
Jesus, it's gonna be even more expensive this year.
You know, if we do take a place... we're gonna have to have my club up there.
I could just see us, all lying in the sun, blabbing away.
I mean, we would— We talk.
We really do.
I love our meetings.
They're so— I don't know.
I just love them.
It's sort of like a continuing story, you know.
It's part Mary Hartman and part Ingmar Bergman.
I
- I love the women.
Marty.
Marty.
Come on.
What is it, honey?
What's the matter?
What is it?
- Th—What?
Tell me!
- I'm in love with somebody else.
I've been seeing another woman... for over a year.
Andatfirst,you know, I thought it was just a—a fling.
But it isn't.
I love her.
I want to live with her.
Oh, God.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt Patti.
But I—
I can't—
You don't know her or anything.
Her name is Marcia Brenner.
She's a— She's a teacher.
She's, uh, 26.
I met her— I met her at Bloomingdale's, for Christ's sake.
I was standing there buying a shirt, you know.
And she, uh—
She was standing next to me.
She asked me, uh... if I liked the shirt that, uh, she was buying for her father.
Oh, God.
I'msosorry.
You tell Patti— You tell Patti that you're sorry.
I'm in love with her.
Ohhh.
- She a good lay?
- Oh, she—
The first thing we have to do is get you a good lawyer.
I just can't believe it.
I really liked Martin.
- This is not a time to pity Martin.
- I am not pitying Martin.
Move fast, Erica.
Don't let the thing drag on.
That's what I did.
It just hurts more and more.
- Get it over with.
- I don't agree with you.
There's nothing to talk about.
The son of a bitch walked out on a magnificent woman.
The son of a bitch may walk right back in in a month or two.
It sounds to me like this thing's just sexual.
Would you take Harold back if he told you he was having an affair?
Oh, hon, Harold has affairs.
He doesn't tell me about 'em.
I don't give a damn, as long as we respect each other.
That's kind of a weird contradiction, isn't it?
- My marriage isn't based on a king-sized bed.
- Neither was mine.
I know it wasn't.
There was a lot of love there.
That's why I'd hate to see it wasted if there's any hope.
- There's no hope.
- You want him back?
Would you take that miserable bastard back?
No.
- I don't think so.
- "Think"?
You have doubts?
- Of course, she has doubts.
- Look, all I know is...
I feel completely and totally alone.
- That'll pass.
- Not if she sits on it, it won't.
Depression has a way of getting nice and comfortable.
There are days I really enjoy my black moods.
- It's like curling up with a good detective story.
- Merde.
How would you know if you were never there?
Hey, honey, these old bones have known plenty of misery.
But I make it a point to get busy as soon as I feel the blues comin' on.
Oh, God.
It was so much easier in the '60s.
We had Vietnam, assassinations, the Black Panthers.
There was a hell of a lot to do.
Can even find a decent cause these days.
We could use a good war.
I could use a double vodka martini.
- Patti's so sad.
- She has a right to be.
So do you.
I'm sad, Elaine.
I'm sad.
I'm lonely.
I'm depressed.
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?
Where you goin'?
See you guys next week.
Well, let me ride home with you.
- You sure you're all right?
- I'll call you later.
I think we made her feel worse than she did.
I don't think that marriage is over yet.
I hope Martin gets a permanent case of the clap and his pecker falls off.
- Hello.
- Fuck you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I had a fight with Phil.
What about?
He was defending Daddy.
He doesn't think it was the right thing, but he understands him.
Phil's a nice boy.
- I hate Daddy.
- He didn't leave you.
He left me.
I still hate him.
You'll get over it.
I don't want to see him again.
Who you talkin' about— Phil or your daddy?
- Both of'em.
- That's crazy.
Then I'm crazy.
Okay, honey.
Oh, Mom.
- I hate him, Mom.
- Oh.
I hate him too.
Would you take him back?
Do you want him to come back?
Yeah.
I guess so.
It's over, kiddo.
For good.
You'd better get used to that, you know?
- Hello?
Hello, Phil.
No.
Yes.
Star Wars.
Mm-hmm.
No.
Nothin'.
Nothin'.
I thought we went over this?
Mm-hmm.
"Balls," said the queen.
"If I had 'em, I'd be king."
Well, if you won't sue me, Erica...
I'll tell you, uh, off the record... that you're in very good health.
- Why am I tired all the time?
- It's called divorce.
Maybe I should take Valium or something.
Come on.
We'll talk about it.
Huh?
- Did you feel this way, uh, before all this happened?
- Never.
- Never?
- Maybe I should see a psychiatrist, Arthur.
Erica, it's normal to feel lousy when a husband walks out on you.
You'd have to be crazy to feel good.
It's only been a few weeks.
Some time has to pass.
- And I'm not saying you shouldn't see a psychiatrist.
- You're just saying...
- Erica's in good health.
- Mmm.
Are you— Are you seeing other men yet?
No!
Well, don't be so shocked.
I'm not in the mood for men, Arthur.
I wasn't referring to sex.
I mean, companionship.
Oh.
Oh.
There are male companions out there who don't wanna get laid?
Well, you— Well, you could have a drink with me.
Is that a pass, Arthur?
No, it was an invitation to have a drink.
How come I never got an invitation to have a drink when I was married?
Well, I don't know.
I
- I never thought about it.
It's a pass, Arthur.
A definite fucking pass.
My relationship with Hal is totally honest.
He doesn't tell me he loves me.
I don't tell him he's fascinating.
- It's pure sex.
- You always were different.
Not always.
- I've just learned to live with my ups and downs.
- I don't know how you do it.
I like my job.
I like my friends.
I like my holidays.
Oh, I'm going to the Catskills next week!
There's a new swami in town.
You wanna go?
Uh, well, my spiritual life is just fine.
What's spiritual?
There'll be some gorgeous men there.
- What does this Bob do?
- He's a press agent— Broadway shows, movies.
Hal says he's a nice guy.
- If he tries to touch me, I'll break his arms.
- Relax.
- Waiter.!
Waiter.!
Right here, pal.
These are fantastic.
These are like claws, Bob.
- Oh, yeah?
- Claw things.
- Oh, yeah.
- We'll take all four of these.
- Take 50,000 of'em, if you got 'em.
- I don't know if I can—
- What do you call these?
- Thank you.
- Claws.
- Claws.
Erica, have a claw.
Unbelievable.
Give her some of those, uh... the shrimp with the, uh—
What do you call the shrimp with the white paper on the end?
- Paper shrimp.
- Paper shrimp.
Give us some of those, okay?
- Okay, anything else?
- That's fine.
Paper shrimp.
Thank you.
Do you work, Erica?
Yeah, I, uh— I work part time at, uh—
The Rowan Gallery in Soho?
- Oh, I've never been there.
- It's a good gallery.
- We could all take a walk there later.
- That would be nice.
- Do you paint?
- No.
I
- I studied painting...
- but I'm not an artist.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm in public relations.
What are you working on?
Well, right now it's a new picture about an ex-Vietnam vet... who comes back to a small Midwestern town and shoots 300 people.
- That should make a fortune.
- I think I saw it.
- I don't think so, Hal.
- I saw it, I'm telling you.
You couldn't.
They haven't made it yet.
- Sounds familiar.
- Erica.
Claire!
Hi!
- It's nice to see you.
- Remember Allison?
Hi.
How you doin'?
- Hey, I called you about a hundred times.
- Yeah.
- You're never in.
- I know.
I know.
Oh, excuse me.
This is, um, Bob.
And this is Claire and Fred and Allison and Elaine and Hal.
- Hal.
I'm Hal.
- Fred.
Nice to meet you.
- How are you?
Glad to know you.
- Can we have lunch next week?
- Yeah.
I'll call you.
- Okay.
I will.
- Want a bear claw, honey?
- Oh, she's full.
- I'm sorry, Erica.
Call us if you need anything.
- I will.
Thank you.
- Please call me.
- Yeah!
I will.
Bye-bye.
Hal, this is great.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
What are those things that would come in this little steamer here?
Waiter,can we have the shrimp with paper?
Bring a couple of Bubble-Up.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- This is crazy.
- Erica, let's take a walk.
- I feel like I've been dim-sum-ed out of my mind.
- I think I'm gonna go home.
- You sure?
- Oh, come on!
- I'll take you home.
- Stay awhile.
- No, I really wanna go home.
- Where do you live?
- You go on, Elaine.
I live in the East 60s.
- Good, I'll take you home.
- Bye.
- Well, let me take you home.
- Bye-bye!
- I'll see you later.
Call you.
- Have a nice time.
See you.
- Boy, that's a nervous lady.
- She has a right to be.
I'm divorced.
Married 11 years.
Two children.
My wife remarried.
She's living out on the island... so I get to see the kids just about every weekend.
When did you get divorced?
It's been... three years.
It was tough at first.
- You feel very disoriented.
- I know.
Yeah, Hal said you were separated?
What happened?
Oh—
My husband left me for a younger woman.
Ha, ha, ha.
He must be out of his mind.
- Are you uncomfortable?
- With you?
No.
Why did you move closer to me?
I don't know.
I-
- I guess I want to be closer to you.
- Don't, Bob!
Uh-uh!
- Why not?
- I said so, that's why.
I-I don't want you to.
- I didn't do anything!
- But you want to, don't you?
- You're paranoid.
- Do you or don't you?
What?
You'd think I was asking you to go to bed with me.
I'm just touchy these days.
I'm sorry.
You sure are.
Maybe I am being less than honest.
I-
- I'd like to see you again, Erica.
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Why not?
- You seem like a nice man.
It-It's not that.
I'm just— I'm not dating.
- Well, what was today?
- Lunch.
Well, lunch is dating in my neighborhood.
Take a girl to lunch, it's dating.
Uh, you're right.
Lunch is dating.
Oh, God. "Dating." It's a silly word.
You are a very complicated woman.
I'm crazy about you.
You son of a... bitch.!
Stop the cab!
Stop it!
You— Stop the cab!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't—
- Stop it!
Get out, you son of a bitch!
- I didn't do anything!
- Just get out!
Just stop it!
Will you stop it?
Just pull the fuck over!
Get out!
I don't want to see you!
I didn't do anything.
This is ridiculous.
Just take me home!
Wonderful.
This is a wonderful thing to come home to.
- Get out of here, Phil!
Just get out of my house!
- I'm sorry.
Out!
I don't want to talk about it.
- We didn't do anything.
- You just get out!
- We didn't do anything!
- Here's your coat.
You be quiet, Patti!
- No!
He's not going to!
- Get out of the door!
- I want him to stay!
- Mrs. Benton— Call you tomorrow!
- Patti!
- Mom, what is with you?
Look, you've got— I don't care what you want!
- You can't run my life!
- Oh, goddamn it!
- I hate it here!
I don't want to live here anymore!
- I don't want to live here, either!
- You can't stop me from seeing Phil.
I can!
I can stop you from doing anything I want!
- No, you can't!
I'll run away!
- I don't care if you run away.
What did I do that was so wrong?
Just tell me, and I'll understand.
I don't think you would act like this if your father still lived here.
Act like what?
I wasn't having an orgy or anything!
- You want me to go to the park?
- Hush!
- Get out of the house!
- Okay, I'll go to the park.
- I'll sit on a bench and do it in public.
- Okay, go ahead!
I'd like to see you!
You might as well do it in public!
- You don't have any kind of feeling about anything!
- Fine!
I'll do it!
- I don't know.
- God, what is with you?
I'm sorry.
God.
Oh, God.
It's just confusing.
I
- I'm sorry I screamed at you, Patti.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
I just don't understand why you get so upset.
- I just can't be your father.
- So just be my mother!
Come here.
Come here, honey.
Call Phil and tell him I'm sorry.
Uh, tell him he can come over.
We can have an orgy.
Maybe he's got a friend for me.
How was your date?
My date?
Oh.
We had dim sum.
I was almost raped.
- He made a pass?
- Yeah.
I don't see what's wrong with that.
You're beginning to sound like my date.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Fine.
How 'bout you?
Call Phil.
Okay.
I'm— I'm afraid.
I'm frightened, you know.
- Mm-hmm.
- I've never been afraid of anything... before in my life.
When I was little, I was—
I don't know.
I was afraid of— that I was gonna get my clothes dirty, or... you know, I was gonna get bad marks on my report.
U
- U-Uhh.
I was afraid when I got my period for the first time.
You know, I— Well, I got my period... when I was, uh— when I was 13, you know.
And most of my—Well—
Some of my friends—
Well, my best friend—
My best friend was Karen Fienstein... and she got her period when she was 12, you know.
So I thought there was something wrong with me, because I didn't get my period.
So I had a terrible year from 12 to 13.
You know, I mean, I-I-I—
I thought there was really something wrong with me.
You know, every time I went to the bathroom...
I would sort of, you know,
- Check and see if I— Yeah, if I got my period yet.
- And go look.
And, suddenly I—
O
- Oh, I was wearing— I was wearing these... dumb little white lace panties... you know, that my grandmother had given me for my birthday or some—
And, um... suddenly I felt this... wet, warm feeling in my crotch, you know.
And then I—
I felt sort of excited, you know.
But then I felt afraid.
I was afraid.
I was afraid... that I was going to get blood all over the... chair... all over my pants.
Then the bell rang, and then the class got up... and then I saw Karen, you know.
And I smiled, and I winked at her, and I went like that.
And she came over, and she said, "What are you smiling about?"
And I said, "I think I got it." And she said, "Oh, thank God!"
I don't really know why I'm telling you all this.
- I mean, it doesn't really—
- Well.
Those are very scary moments, and you think a lot about that when you're a kid.
It's natural.
- And what's happening now?
- Everything seems very different.
I'm— I'm not able to... know what's gonna happen.
You know, before I had a sense that...
- life would go on, and—
- Yes.
- Now, it's like every day is like, "Whew!"
- Yeah.
What's gonna happen?
And I don't know how to control it.
- And I don't know—
- Yeah.
I don't know— I don't know what to do.
Your whole life has been disrupted, discombobulated.
And... it's a new life right now.
I mean, what can you do?
You know, you can't live my life for me, can you?
No.
No.
I certainly can't live your life for you.
It's your life.
But what I can do... is to explore it with you and see what's happening now in your life.
Yeah.
Maybe the confusion that you're feeling now... will clear up.
I'm pretty sure it will.
I think, right now, it would be a really good idea if you came twice a week.
But very quickly we'll move into once a week.
Because it's a lot more important what you do out there... than what you do in here.
Mr. Benton would like to meet there at 1:00.
Hello, Mrs. Benton.
Hi.
It's good to see you.
I'm glad you called.
Let me have your coat.
- You look terrific.
- I'm worried about Patti.
She's very angry at you.
Yeah.
Well, she's got a right to be.
I'm seeing a therapist, and I want her to see her too.
- It's expensive.
- That's all right.
- I'll-I'll take care of it.
- Good.
- Well, that's settled.
- Who's the—Who's the therapist?
Oh, her name is Tanya Berkel.
- A woman.
- I don't know any men named Tanya.
Well, that's good.
I think that's— that's good.
Good.
I glad you think it's good.
You really hate me, don't you?
- Yeah.
- I don't hate you.
- Oh, you were always a very compassionate man, Martin.
- Now, wait a minute.
I-
How— How can you hate somebody that you were in love with for 16 years?
I don't—
It's easy.
If you're trying to make me feel guiltier than I already do...
- you're doing a good job.
- Good.
This is ridiculous.
Why are we having this conversation?
Martin, do you know how many times we made love?
- No.
- No, I don't want to get into that.
I wanna tell you.
At least 2,000 times.
That's counting twice a week for 16 years.
You should put it up on your ticker tape.
I think it's a very interesting statistic.
I wanna know something.
Did you fall out of love with my— my flesh, my body... or me—with Erica?
Did you fall out of love with Erica?
Wait a minute.
I didn't fall out of love with you.
I
- I love you.
I mean, all right, it-it's different now, but I—
I love you.
I can't just erase all those years.
- I'll always love you.
- I was your hooker, Martin.
I was a bright, high-priced, classy hooker.
Upper East Side by way of Vassar hooker... but I was your hooker.
You have a lousy shrink.
How long do you think Marcia's gonna last?
Well, I'm gonna marry her.
The awesome sanctity of marriage.
Listen, if you want to sit up here with me and have a conversation, that's great.
But if you want to have an argument, I think you'd better leave.
- I want to have an argument!
- You're flippin'.
Call Patti.
I never had any self-esteem.
That was the trouble.
I never had any self-esteem.
That was the trouble.
I suppose I thought looks would do it.
Well, I'll tell you.
It is a nice feeling to like yourself.
Bette Davis always had self-esteem.
- Oh.
- So did Katharine Hepburn.
- Mm-hmm.
- Terrific woman.
- Look at this.
- Oh.
- Beautiful.
- It's strange, isn't it?
I mean, where are all the wonderful women that were in the movies in the old days?
Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Joan Crawford.
- Where are all the women?
- Well, we've got, uh...
- Jane Fonda, Barbra Streisand.
- Oh, please.
It's not the same thing.
I'd hate to see Fonda and Streisand...
- in a toe-to-toe with Hepburn and Davis.
- Right.
- There's no contest.
- Different times.
Hi.
- Hi.
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?
- No.
- Uh-uh.
- We were wondering where all the women movie stars are... compared to 20, 30 years ago.
Well, um, I think we're getting to an age...
- where the dominate cult figure is bisexual.
- Oh, God.
- Maybe unisexual would be a more appropriate term.
You mean like Mick and Dylan and David?
- That sort of thing?
- Mm-hmm.
What's so funny?
- Is that good or bad?
- I don't know.
Nobody knows.
- You're entitled to an opinion.
- Well, I'm not bisexual, if that's what you mean.
- Yes, we know that.
- You know, but maybe she doesn't.
How'd we get started on this?
Self-esteem.
I could write a book on self-esteem.
"Self-esteem and the American Woman."
Once divorced... sleeping around, drinking too much... pretending to have a lot of self-you-know-what.
Really having next to none.
- You getting your period, Elaine?
- Sure.
But I also have no fucking confidence.
Here.
Drink this.
Why do people always give you water when you fall apart?
- I don't need water.
I need booze.
- That's a girl.
Don't worry, honey.
Aunt Elaine is just a manic-depressive.
You know, like, uh, Jekyll and Hyde?
I don't think you get enough vitamin C.
- See you guys later.
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.
- Take care.
- She's somethin' else, Erica.
- Yeah, tough cookie.
- She's confused about Martin.
- How is the son of a bitch?
Hey.
We forgot Claire Trevor.
- Jean Arthur, Susan Hayward.
- What about Greta Garbo?
That was before my time.
I liked Rita Hayworth.
She was pretty.
Everywhere I go I see... couples.
I see people holding hands or their arms around each other... cheek to cheek or—
I just feel jealous.
Oh, I have so much to say, you know, at the end of the day.
I tell Patti everything.
I think about her, you know, going away to school and—
I know it's, uh— it's a couple of years away... but I think about it as if... it's gonna happen, you know, tomorrow.
- Yes.
- I-
I guess I'm lonely.
I was very lonely too when I got divorced.
I didn't know you were divorced.
Yes.
And it's certainly okay to feel lonely.
You're supposed to in a situation like this.
It's— It's what is— what's expected.
It's really okay to feel anything— anger, jealousy... depression.
It's okay to feel.
I— I feel guilty about my feelings.
Well, guilt is something that I get livid about... because it's kind of a man-made emotion.
And, uh...
I would like to see you... take a vacation from guilt.
Stop feeling guilty for one week.
Just-Just say, "Erica, turn off the guilt."
Just turn it off.
Don't feel guilty.
It doesn't get you anywheres.
It really prolongs the agony.
And—
- I know what you mean.
I'll try.
- Yeah.
And don't feel guilty about feeling guilty, either.
And don't feel ashamed of your feelings.
They're your feelings.
They have no I.Q.
They have no morality.
They're your feelings.
Just feel 'em.
When were you divorced?
I was divorced three years ago.
But let's get back to you and loneliness.
When you were married, did you ever feel lonely?
- No, not really.
No.
- When you were married, did you feel lonely?
Never?
No.
Well, sometimes, but I wasn't scared then, you know?
This scares me.
It is scary.
It's a whole new way of life.
Did you ever find yourself wanting to be alone?
Yes!
But I knew it wasn't gonna be forever.
Does it feel to you as if this is gonna be forever— the way you feel now?
Well...
I haven't had sex for seven weeks.
It's been seven weeks since Martin left.
I always took sex for granted.
Are you feeling sexy these days?
Hardly.
And, uh—
- What was I saying?
- Sex.
Oh, yes.
I was hoping you'd forgotten.
Um... well, we just had a pretty good sex life, you know.
I just— It was very—
This isn't fun.
No.
I just—
- I enjoyed sex.
It was— It was nice.
- Mm-hmm.
We were pretty... wild, Martin and me.
Mm-hmm.
Tell me what you mean by that.
Wha-What do you mean, you were pretty wild?
Well, we had a good sex life.
What exactly was it like?
Jesus!
What do you think happened?
What happens?
You sound pretty angry.
What's that all about?
If I knew that, I wouldn't be here.
Well, what are you gonna do about it?
You're looking at me as if I have the answers.
I don't have the answer for you.
I can tell you what I would do... if I were me and I were in your situation.
What?
Well, one thing, I'd do a lot of what you're doing already.
I'd be a— I'd spend a lot of time with my friends... as you're doing.
And I'd also sort of take myself by the hand... and say, "Come on, Tanya.
Get into the stream of life.
"Get back in there.
"Don't be scared of going out with guys.
Let's open the door and walk out and get in the stream of life."
- Men, huh?
- Yeah, men.
I'd risk it.
I'd risk it with some new men.
They're people, you know.
I think you could enjoy them.
Take a chance.
Yeah.
I guess I should.
Ugh.
- Can I help you?
- I'll have a glass of white wine, please.
Two beers, Tom.
- Erica!
- Hi!
- Come, join us.
- Okay.
It's good to see you.
Erica Benton, Edward Thoreaux.
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.
Erica works over at the Rowan.
Oh, really?
I haven't seen the new show.
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it.
Edward just got back from a year in Rome.
He's a painter.
How was Rome?
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it.
I loved it.
How are you, Erica?
Oh, I'm a little weird these days.
- I'm getting divorced.
- Ah, I'm surprised.
- Why?
- You seem like such a normal person.
Compared to me, that is.
It's the normal people who are getting divorced.
Nobody else bothers to get married.
If I got married every time I thought it was serious, I would be in lots of trouble.
How are you?
The work I'm doing is nice.
Edward and I are definitely an item.
- So life is good.
- One hates to be thought of as an item.
Hey, what's happening, babe?
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Jean, how ya doin'?
- Hi.
My name is Edward Thoreaux.
- Charlie.
Nice to see you.
- How do you do?
- Were you slumming?
- I wasn't up till now.
What does she want from me?
There's a party at Tom Whalen's loft.
Do you want to come?
Tom Whalen?
You mean the guy who paints the turtles?
- Yeah.
- I pass.
Thanks.
- Erica?
- I don't think so.
It was nice to meet you.
Arrivederla.
Arrivederla, my ass.
Listen, what are you doing out by yourself?
Where's honey?
- We're getting divorced.
- No shit?
What happened?
He was buying a shirt in Bloomingdale's, and he fell in love.
- Am I supposed to be sorry or what?
- No.
- Buy me another glass of wine, Charlie.
- Be right back.
Take me to your loft, Charlie.
Well, you want a cup of coffee?
Something to eat?
- Uh-uh.
- A bottle of Chianti in the kitchen.
Charlie, let's just do it, okay?
Now, before I change my mind.
Okay, okay.
Let's just get something straight right off the top, babe, huh?
I don't get involved with my women.
I'm a short-term guy.
I don't fall in love.
I don't wanna get married.
- Right.
- The only thing you can count on me for is sex.
I am what I am.
I make no bones about it.
Charlie, I'm very nervous.
Your talking is just making me more nervous.
Okay.
- You havin' trouble?
- Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Here.
Here.
Wait.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Just a second!
You got your thing caught.
- My necklace is in it.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
Careful.
There we go.
Oh, what a disaster!
Cheer up, will ya?
Yeah.
Ahh.
The maiden!
Delightful.
Delightful.
Will you stop actin' like some kind of virgin, huh?
Yoo-hoo?
Miss?
Yo.!
Ah, here you are.
Hi.
Charlie, I've only slept with one man in 17 years.
Jesus, I was wrong.
I could've sworn you've had a few affairs.
Oh, man, what a beautiful body.
Come here.
Cheer up, will ya?
This is your party.
I'm a little embarrassed.
- When does she stop?
- Ow!
What happened?
An injury.
- What's the matter?
- A splinter.
- Where?
- In my toe.
A splinter in the toe?
The foot doctor's here.
Let me see.
Let me see.
First we'll have to remove the outer garments.
Oh, yes.
Ah, what a lovely piece of equipment.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Huh.
You like that, huh?
You like that, don't you?
Your turn, baby.
Hmm?
You gonna turn me on?
- That was nice.
Very nice.
- I have to go.
I'll see you tomorrow night, okay?
- No.
- What's the matter?
You mad at me?
- No.
- Come back tomorrow night.
- Uh-uh.
- Why not?
I don't fall in love, Charlie.
I'm a— I'm a short-term guy.
I'll tell you one thing.
Your ex-old man's a fuckin' asshole.
Good night, Charlie.
Hi.
Wait a minute.
I want to talk to you.
- Call me.
- Hey, come on.
Hey, you wanna give me a heart attack or what?
Jesus, Martin!
What do you want?
Well, I just wanted to tell you that I had a nice talk with Patti.
- She's okay.
- I know.
How are you?
I got laid last night.
- Remember Billy Higgins?
- Uh-uh.
Yeah, you do.
He's that big, tall, blond guy, worked for Merrill Lynch.
- Tennis player.
About my age.
- Right, right.
Yeah.
He had a heart attack last week.
He dropped dead.
- That's too bad.
- You look good.
Would you try to have a linear conversation, Martin?
Look, wait a minute.
I just want us to be friends.
I mean, if not for my sake, then for Patti's.
I don't wanna be your friend!
- What the hell do you want me to do?
- Just leave me alone.
Well, Billy was supposed to go out to L.A.
- Now they want me to take his spot.
- Take it.
- Well, it means I'd have to move out there.
- Good.
If I do go out, can Patti come out and spend some time with me?
You'll have to ask Patti.
Herbert, what do you think?
It looks a little high on the right to me.
High on the right.
Hmm.
What do you think?
I
- I think the whole thing is too high.
I like it where it is.
Ifyoulikeditwhereitis, then why did you ask me?
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Where would you like to go for dinner?
I can't, Saul.
My daughter's coming home from school.
We're eating at home.
- Well, give her a call.
Tell her to join us.
- No!
- Well, she doesn't have to know I'm your lover.
- You're not my lover.
Well, uh— You, you know what I mean.
I'm not very good at hiding my feelings, Saul.
What are your feelings?
Well, I— I just slept with a man that I barely know.
- I mean, casual sex is not my—
- No, no.
- I-I don't—
- No, it's not— I don't sleep with every woman I meet.
I'm experimenting.
I'm— Well, I know it sounds a little cold... but that's... the way it is these days.
I just want to see how it feels to make love to someone that I'm not in love with.
How does it feel?
Sort of empty.
Well, at least you're honest.
The sex was very good.
You're a very nice man.
You have a bizarre way of handing out a compliment.
It was the best I could do.
Why did you flirt with me at the gallery?
I think it was mutual.
Ah, silly games we play.
There's no need for them, you know.
- Do you want to know how I really feel?
- Yes, I do.
As soon as the sex was over, I wanted to leave.
- That's very hostile.
- I don't feel hostile.
I like you.
Perhaps you'd better go home.
I'm getting a very big headache.
My husband used to get headaches whenever I didn't want to have sex.
Poor bugger must have had migraines.
- You-You got a coat?
- Yeah.
I'll see you later.
- Behave yourselves, ladies.
- Oh, yeah?
- We'll try.
- I'm always good.
Just show me the bar.
- Ah.
- That did it.
I've gotta go home pretty soon.
- Hello, Erica.
- Hi, Edward.
Nice to see you.
- These are my friends.
This is Elaine Liebowitz.
- How do you do?
- Edward Thoreaux.
And Sue Miller.
- How do you do?
- And Jeannette Lewin.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Erica.
- Can I take your coats?
- You look wonderful!
- Thanks.
I'm Jean Starret.
Erica has told me about your, uh, club.
This is Jeannette and Elaine and Sue.
- What club?
- Do you know anything about consciousness raising?
- Not really.
- Neither do we.
Wejust kind of get together once a week and complain a lot.
- That's very American.
- Aren't you an American?
I'm from Cleveland, but I try to forget it.
- I was hoping you'd show up.
- How's your headache?
I had it ever since you left.
How's the party?
Usual.
Well, whenever you put about 50 artists together in one room... you get a really pleasant combination... of gossip, paranoia, envy, fear, trembling... hatred, lust and pretense.
It's, uh, wonderful.
Tell me some good gossip.
Good gossip, eh?
Hmm.
Oh.
You see the short, wiry fellow in the corner?
The one with his arm around Lady MacBeth?
Well, his name is Conrad Zweiback.
He's Hungarian.
Very intense.
Very ambitious.
- Can't paint for shit.
- Who's the woman?
She's the wife of Henry Gebhart, the critic.
- Oh, I've never met him.
- Oh, he's a spider.
Sets traps for young artists, using his wife as bait.
- Is he gay?
- Oh, no.
No, not at all.
That would make sense.
No, it appears he likes to watch his wife make love to other men.
Now, if the other man is pleasing to Lady MacBeth... he becomes the new discovery of Gebhart.
- How do you know all this?
- I was discovered by Henry Gebhart.
I'm kidding.
No, but it's true.
The story's true.
- You're very beautiful tonight.
- You look very good yourself.
Shall we dance?
You're full of surprises.
Remember, we don't really know each other.
- Tanya!
- Erica!
- How great to see you here.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm an old friend of Jean Starret's.
- Ohh.
And I'd like to have you meet my friend, Sophie Windham.
- Hello.
- Erica Benton.
Uh, this is Saul Kaplan.
Tanya Berkel.
- Hi, Saul.
- Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- And we're looking around for Jean, so we'll go along.
- I think she's back there.
- Okay, but I see something to eat in there, so we'll go in there.
- Okay.
- See you later.
Have fun.
- Who was that woman?
- Oh, that was no woman.
That was my therapist.
- Having a good time?
- Yeah.
You?
- Hey, what do you say, babe?
- Charlie!
God.
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah.
Charlie tells me he's a great artist.
Uh, this is Elaine, and this is Jeannette.
- Hello.
- This is Charlie.
- Hello.
- This is Saul Kaplan.
Saul Kaplan?
The Saul Kaplan?
Oh, let me get over there.
Hey, this is a real honor.
I mean, really!
Hey, I bow at your feet, man.
Now, this guy's a real fucking artist.
Thank you.
You may rise.
- Thank you.
- You're drunk, Charlie.
Yes, and stoned.
Great combo.
- Is he dangerous?
- Oh, ask her if I'm good, babe.
- Shut up, Charlie.
Jesus!
- Ohhh, we really got it on one night.
I mean, dynamite.
And she slams the door in my face.
What did I do to deserve such a rotten fate?
I balled my ass off;
the lady won't see me again.
- It's getting to be a '60's party.
- What, is it raining?
What happened?
What happened?
- Why don't you go home, Charlie.
- Why don't you fuck off!
- I'll wipe the floor with you.
- Up yours!
- Come on.
Let's leave.
- No, no.
No.
He leaves.
We stay.
Oh, I get it.
You're ballin' her too.
If you don't mind your dumb fuckin' manners—
I thought you were gonna kill him.
No, I wouldn't give the bastard the satisfaction.
If he made the front page of the Daily News, he'd end up famous.
His work is good, actually.
I was surprised.
Well, you can be a bastard and have talent.
Where'd you see his work, eh?
His place.
You disappointed in me?
I don't know you well enough to be disappointed in you.
But if you ever do it again, I'll kill you.
You're a strange man.
No, I'm a simple man really.
Got very simple tastes.
I like Titian, Rembrandt, Botticelli, Kojak...
Camembert cheese... expensive shoes—
I have bad feet—
London, Vermont, New York about half the time.
And being madly in love.
And I've been without that for a long time now.
What's so funny, eh?
What the hell are you laughing at, eh?
I bare my soul, and you laugh at me.
What is it?
You stepped in dog shit!
I think this is poodle shit.
Oh, yes, after a while, you can tell one kind from another.
I can even tell the difference between an East Side dog... an uptown dog and a Village dog.
Now, East Side dogs shit only the best... and Village dogs shit art.
In London, they don't shit at all, you know.
I don't think they're allowed to, no, no.
In London, I think they have an underground passage where all the dogs shit.
I was born in London, you know.
My mother and my father had a shop near Stepney Green.
That's the Lower East Side of London.
One day when I was about six, my parents had a row, you know.
My mother, she threw a pickled herring at my dad, and it, uh, missed.
Splattered all against the wall.
I took one look at that pickled herring... and that's when I decided to become an abstract expressionist.
Your work does remind me of pickled herring.
Mmm.
Hey, I want to know about that man you lived with.
Were you passionate with each other?
- You mean sexually?
- I mean in every way.
Well, we were married for a very long time.
- Well, I was married for nine years.
- Really?
Eight of those years were very passionate.
Well, "passion's" a mild word for it, really.
It's—Well, it was more like war.
How did your marriage end?
Not with a whimper, but with a bang.
Matilda— Her name is Matilda—
She wrote poetry for her soul, and she swam a hundred laps a day for her body.
Now, this was after we had the two children.
- Boys?
- My son is 12.
My daughter's nine.
Well, one day I came home, and I found her in bed... with a high diver from the local pool.
- Oh, God.
- I wanted to kill the poor sap, but something kept me from it.
- What?
- He was about seven feet tall.
Oh, you know something?
I-
I wasn't angry.
I felt relief, really.
I was glad it was over— for both of us!
Well, I wasn't a very good husband.
My work means everything to me.
I don't think I believe that.
Don't you miss your children?
I love them.
Sometimes I miss them.
But I see them every summer.
We have a place up in Vermont.
You'll like it.
You seem to have my life worked out for me.
For us.
I want you.
- You know that?
- Yes, I'm getting the message.
Do you want me?
My head tells me to slow down.
But I don't think my pulse is normal.
You know, there are three things that we could do right now.
You could call a taxi and go home.
Or we could go on walking, and, uh, I could lecture you... on the real dilemma of modern art.
Or we could go to my place, and we could thoroughly enjoy each other.
You want hot sauce on your eggs?
Please.
- Grated cheese?
- Everything.
I feel great.
I feel... happy.
I
- I don't know what's going on.
This is craziness.
I don't understand anything anymore.
I feel— I like to do things, you know.
- I want to travel.
- We'll travel.
I want to see Greece.
I want to see Persia.
I'd like to go to Tibet.
I'd like to open up a little restaurant.
Nothing fancy.
Just a little something where I sing under a spotlight.
You ever thought about skateboarding?
I do want to go to India!
India I can do without.
Why?
I like a nice bathroom.
I may go back to school.
I may go back to school.
What's wrong with the gallery?
Oh, I need more money.
I don't want to depend on Martin forever.
Also, I could use a real challenge in my work.
Live with me.
That'd be a real challenge.
I could use a challenge in my work.
Living with me is work.
Hey, this is really delicious.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Does it still feel empty?
No, but it tastes like hot sauce.
Why do you only have one child?
Do you want to have a child?
No, no, no.
Well, I had two miscarriages after Patti.
I quit trying.
Why?
Because...
I want to know everything there is to know about you.
Mm.
Paint!
Paint!
Paint!
Please, paint!
- You are the most delicious woman I've ever met!
- I have to go.
- There's something so damn Victorian about you!
Will you ever, ever spend the whole day... followed by the whole night with me in this room?
I don't know!
Look, I'll come over to your place if it's any easier.
There's just something so nice about sleeping... and waking up with a person that you like.
You really know how to rush a girl, don't you?
You really know how to rush a girl, don't you?
Erica, underneath this haunted, driven shell of a man... there lives a warm homebody... who likes to watch TV and chew cashews... while the woman he loves is finishing a good novel.
Sounds like my marriage.
I want to meet your daughter.
- Now?
- Whenever.
Come to dinner tomorrow night.
Don't know the address.
I like your style.
A girl in my school got an abortion last week.
- How old is she?
- Sixteen.
- It's not that unusual.
- Do I know her?
Mm-mm.
Cost 200 bucks.
She said it was awful too.
The doctor kissed her on the mouth right after the abortion.
- Oh, God!
- Two hundred bucks!
What about her parents?
Do they know?
- No way!
- Well, who paid for it?
We all chipped in.
- What about the boy?
- She was too embarrassed to ask him.
That stinks.
- Here comes Casanova.
- Oh, I'm warning you.
- I'm warning you.
- Shake it.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- All right?
- Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Come in.
This is Patti Benton.
Saul Kaplan.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I saw one of your paintings in the Museum of Modern Art.
Oh?
Did you like it?
I didn't understand it.
- Hmm.
Well, I'm gonna like you.
- She never lies.
How old are you?
- Forty-two.
- You don't look it.
- You look older.
- Patti!
- How old do I look?
- I already know.
You're 15.
- Do I look it?
- You look much older.
Good.
- Can I have some?
- With dinner.
Give her half a glass.
Cut it with water.
- Yeah, that's what the French do.
- We're not French.
Booze is worse than grass.
I smoke grass once in a while.
- So do I.
- Got any?
Now, don't be precocious, Patti.
I'm not being precocious.
I'm just a normal 15-year-old girl.
Actually, I'm not normal.
I'm still a virgin.
Patti, come into the kitchen with me.
Excuse us.
- You're being very rude!
- I guess I'm just nervous.
- This is the first time you've brought a man home.
- Do you like him?
It's too early to tell.
He's cute.
This is—This is really delicious.
Your mother's a very good cook.
How can you tell from one dish?
She made eggs for me the other night.
With hot sauce and grated cheese?
- That's right.
- Hmph.
She really likes you then.
I don't think I'm having fun at this party.
I am.
Relax.
I know that you and Saul are lovers.
It's not funny.
What's the matter?
You always told me to tell the truth.
It's obvious that you invited Saul here to prepare me.
Prepare you for what?
Um, look, I'm the one who asked to come here.
- I wanted to meet you.
- I have a father.
I don't want to be your father.
I'm not marrying Saul.
I-
- Marry him!
I don't care!
- He's my friend.
So marry him.
It doesn't matter to me.
Nobody's asking you to stop loving your father.
Well, you know, it would be easier if Daddy could see me here sometimes.
Okay.
Sorry.
I behaved like a 15-year-old.
I do it all the time.

Good morning.
Hi.
How come you're not jogging?
Oh, I had an early appointment with this guy.
What's, uh—What's up?
Well, I've decided that you can come to the apartment... to see Patti whenever you want.
- Oh, good.
I'm glad.
- Just call first.
Okay.
Oh, I meant to tell you.
I'm not going to California now.
- Why?
- Oh, a lot of things.
Mostly, no money.
Well, you know, I've, uh— I've stopped seeing my therapist, and... well, I'm looking around for a better job, so... the money thing will be a lot easier for you.
We could make it real easy if you want to.
What do you mean?
Well, I broke up with Marcia.
I'm surprised.
Yeah, I am too, kind of.
Well, the truth of it is she left me.
I don't know.
I mean, the minute I moved in there, we stopped having fun.
It's craziness.
I'm sorry.
Are you really?
Yeah, I'm sorry for you.
- I want to come back.
- No.
- Will you think about it?
- No, Martin.
I mean, I was thinkin' you could think of me... as this guy who was sick for a long time, you know, and then recovered.
Think you could do that?
It doesn't work that way, you know?
Yeah.
Patti said you have a boyfriend.
Yeah.
We're goin' steady.
Well, I'll call you.
Bye.
Bye, Martin.
Patti's gonna have to spend more time alone.
Oh, she can cope with that.
Yeah.
I worry about her.
I have to.
I have to.
- You don't have to.
- I do.
I have enough money for both of us.
I don't want your money, Saul.
Look, I'd take your money, if I needed it... and if you had it.
But, you—you're an artist.
Oh, yes.
What's Patti doing this summer?
Oh, she wants to go to summer school.
Well, you know what would be nice— what would be very nice indeed— would be if both of you came up to Vermont... for the whole of the summer.
I can't leave the gallery.
I can't.
He'd let you go for the summer.
Well, maybe for a week, but not for the whole summer.
- It's very beautiful.
- Oh.
Want one?
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, um, one lemon, please.
- Make it two.
- I'm sorry.
No lemon.
Vanilla.
- Okay.
That's all right.
- Fine.
Good.
- Your children will be there, won't they?
- Yes, they certainly will!
Yes.
Well, we'd have a lot of fun.
- Madame.
- Fine.
I can't.
You keep saying you can't.
How much are these, please?
- Twenty cents each, please.
- Twenty cents each.
- "I can't."
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Well, I can't.
- Oh, you can.
What am I gonna do up there?
Watch you paint?
Go fishing?
Go swimming?
Well, it sounds nice, doesn't it?
Ah, yeah.
I'll come up for a couple of weekends.
Life is very complicated.
I've been on vacation for 16 years.
Oh, look, listen.
I-I know you want to get out on your own.
And I approve.
I wouldn't try to stop you.
- What do you mean, you approve?
- What?
- I don't understand that word.
Why are you saying you approve?
- Oh, look.
- I'm not doing this for your approval, you know.
- No, listen.
Let me finish.
- No, that's really not what I have on my mind.
- Please.
All I meant was—
- I hate that.
- Yes.
All I meant was that if—
Well, spending a few weeks with someone you like— that's not out of line.
How do you know?
How can you say that?
How do you know what I need, what I want to do for myself?
I think we need a marriage counselor.
Why don't you come back here every weekend?
Because if I stop painting for a few days...
I may stop painting altogether.
Do you really believe that?
Absolutely.
Men!
Women.
You know what I did yesterday?
I threw out a whole new jar of blackberry jam.
Martin loved blackberry jam.
I think the problem was that I didn't do things as myself, you know.
I did things as this—
Martin and Erica, Martin and Erica.
It wasn't his fault.
I
- I liked it.
Saul and Erica will be different from Martin and Erica.
- You want to see other women?
- I want you!
- You're free to.
- I don't want to.
Then don't.
Do you want to see other men?
Not today.
I'm getting a headache.
I have to go back to work.
So do I.
Would you rather go back to bed?
Mm-hmm.
Yes?
This thing needs oil.
See, I'm gonna put those pillows, you know, from the sofa around there.
- Mm-hmm.
- Carpet.
- Has a lot of outlets.
- Yeah, a lot of outlets.
Ta-da!
Another fireplace!
It's nice, isn't it?
- I can afford it.
- Then take it.
I don't know what to do with Saul, you know.
He wants me to go to Vermont.
He goes there for five months!
- Then don't take it.
- You're a lot of help.
Why don't I go to Vermont?
You stay here, work your ass off and be sensible.
I'll go pick berries and dance in the woods with Saul.
It's confusing, Elaine.
Since I started taking Lithium, I feel more sensible than this month's Good Housekeeping.
No more black, moody lows.
But I sure as hell miss my highs.
- You want my advice?
- Yeah.
Do you know how rare a man like Saul is?
You know how many jerks there are out there?
He's smart.
He's funny.
- Is he a good lover?
- Eh.
Start packin', honey.
I finally settled down.
I gotta tell you this.
Oh, it's crazy.
It's okay, honey.
It's really okay.
You're looking very beautiful.
But you're traveling awfully light.
How do you pack pickled herring?
I'll definitely come up for holidays.
Do you know what it's like up there in the woods all alone?
- Paint.
- Hmm.
Perhaps I'll find some nice, warm moose to keep me company.
Am I only a sexual object to you?
No.
No, you're a bright, willful, curious woman... who is also a sexual object.
I hope it's the hottest... muggiest, most miserable summer on record.
You're so damn stubborn!
I'm not.
I'm really not.
Come with me, for Christ's sake!
I can't.
- Independent.
- Trying to be.
Woman.
- Vicious.
- No.
Honest.
You're driving me crazy.
Okay, Mario, I've got it!
- Will you hold this a minute?
- Yeah.
- Have you got it?
- I got it.
- Bye.
- What about this?
- Oh, that's for you.
- How the hell am I gonna get it home?
Take a taxi.
Jesus Christ!
Look at this.
My sneaker's ruined!
- They're only $35.
- Fucking city's turned into one big pile of dog shit!
Come on out and take a crap on me!
Everybody else is!
Fuck.
- Give it back to the poodles.
- What's the point of jogging for two and a half miles?
Giving yourself lung cancer.
Tell you somethin', Erica.
The longer I'm married to you... the more you sound like my mother.
Clean your own sneaker.
- You wanted me to step in it.
- You're going crazy, Martin.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Why would I want you to step in dog shit?
Well, that's a good question.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not your mother.
- You know.
- Yeah.
Listen, do you think we got time for a little quickie?
I got about 11 minutes.
Hey, come on!
Gimme a break here.
I'm gettin' frostbite.
Jesus, I got to quit smoking.
- I saw Jacobs on Tuesday.
Did I tell you?
- Uh-uh.
Yeah, I went in for my annual physical.
How are you?
Fine.
You sound surprised.
Well, you know, I go up there for the damn thing... and my blood pressure goes up 20 points from the anxiety of having to take the exam.
- What are you doing today?
- Working at the gallery.
Oh, yeah.
Goin' to school.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
Hmm.
Did the earth move?
Bye.
I'm telling you, we expose that kid to too much.
- Well, we still lock the door.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Have a good time.
See you tonight.
- Mm-hmm.
"Tonight, the ballet world was introduced...
"to a brilliant new talent-
"the long-awaited debut of Erica Benton.
"Miss Benton astounded the ballet world last night... in her incredible performance of Swan Lake. "
"Her pas de deux were breathtaking."
- Hello.
- Hi.
There she is.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are you?
- You look great.
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.
You're just in time for some big news.
- Well.
- Oh, hi.
Uhhh.
- Wine.
- Let's have a glass- another carafe.
Okay?
- Yeah.
And, uh...
- Anything else?
- Steamer Vic.
- Refills for everybody.
- Are you ready?
- You're in love.
Would that I were.
It's not my news.
- Sue.
- The only thing that happened to me last week was... my elevator man got arrested for flashing.
- What is it, Jeannette?
- I met a man.
Well, that's terrific!
- Well, there's a little problem.
- He's married.
No.
- He's very young.
- You're not close.
- How young?
- He's 19.
- Oh, Jesus.
- I know.
I know.
- He's very mature.
- Nineteen?
The problem is:
Does she fuck him, or does she adopt him?
I'm a terrible person.
I'm drunk, and I'm giddy, and I'm going to the loo.
- Sorry, Jeannette.
- It's okay.
I think Elaine's going through early menopause.
It is so ironic.
I've dated so many men... in the last few years that were my age or older... and Steven- his name is Steven- is the first man that I've really liked...
- since my divorce.
- Well, what's he like?
He's calm, quiet.
He doesn't come on.
He's very bright.
He's not afraid to be tender.
Well, if you were a man and you were talking about a 19-year-old girl... then there would be no problem, would there?
No, I worry about Teddy.
I mean, how do you tell a six-year-old child his new daddy is a teenager?
- Where does he live now?
- With his parents.
Maybe I should adopt him.
Did I miss anything?
No.
It's just that last night was so incredible.
I put Teddy to bed, and Steven came over.
We just sat and talked all night long.
- I mean, till 7:00 this morning.
- What did you talk about?
We talked a lot about loneliness.
- Got kind of emotional.
- Then?
- Promise you won't laugh?
- I promise.
Well, then he undressed me, and he gave me a massage.
And it was the most incredible experience I think I've ever had in my life.
- I'll bet.
- Was it sexual?
That's it.
It was and it wasn't.
I mean, he massaged my feet and my toes... and he massaged my fingers.
He massaged my eyes.
He actually massaged my eyes.
And then I had an orgasm.
And then another and then another.
I'd say it was sexual.
There ain't nothin' wrong with a good, old-fashioned eyeball orgasm.
Oh, I love them.
I mean, I couldn't live without them.
- Have you read the latest book?
- No, I didn't.
- You think I'm going crazy.
- Crazy?
What's this boy's phone number?
- Don't be offended, okay?
- No.
What?
What?
- Is he being honest with you?
- That's pretty naive, Erica.
- No, it isn't.
- No, it's not.
There's no such thing as total honesty... not with men.
They're all wrapped up in sexual ego.
- What the hell is sexual ego, Elaine?
- Never getting enough.
Always on the make.
Constantly worried about performing.
That's ridiculous.
I know lots of men who are interested in other things besides sex.
- Name one.
- My husband.
Harold hasn't made a pass in six months.
Well, listen, Elaine.
Don't you think you're taking this thing a little too far?
Me?
No.
- I think you're getting to be a man-hater.
- I love men!
We're talking about their honesty.
- Do you think Martin is totally honest?
- I don't think about it.
I think Erica has the second-best man in the five boroughs.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, I'm sure.
I think what I'm gonna do is just go along with things the way they are...
- and just see what happens.
- Have fun, honey.
The worst that can happen is that it'll end.
No, I think the worst that could happen is that his parents will find out.
You're fabulous.
- I love you.
- Swiftly moving on.
Patti?
Hello?
Hi.
- Girls had a long meeting tonight, huh?
- They're not meetings.
- What's on the news?
- Nothin'.
They're shootin' up Rhodesia, and, uh, the garbagemen are raising' hell again.
You know.
Jeannette is having an affair with a 19-year-old boy.
Oh, shit.
She's flipped.
Men go out with younger women all the time.
Nineteen is four years older than Patti.
Yeah, where is Patti?
She went to the movies with Phil.
- I like Phil.
- Well, maybe Phil should meet Jeannette.
- Martin.
- How are Elaine and Sue?
- Fine.
- Elaine makes me very nervous.
- She likes you.
- Yeah.
I like her all right.
She just comes on too strong.
So do you sometimes.
Sometimes I get the feeling that you prefer Elaine and Sue and Jeannette to me.
That's ridiculous, Martin.
- Do you?
- Sometimes.
Look, Martin.
Patti's coming home.
I have to get up early.
Martin, I'm not in the mood.
You give me a headache.
- Take an aspirin.
- Shit.
Anybody home?
We're in here, honey.
What's goin' on in there?
Want me to go out and come in again?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How was the movie?
- Good.
We saw the new Lina Wertmüller film.
- Yeah?
Did you like it?
- I loved it.
But Phil thought it was flawed.
How old is Phil again?
You know how old he is.
Why?
Well, your mother's friend Jeannette is having an affair with a 19-year-old guy.
- Good for her.
- Yeah?
- Would Phil go out with Jeannette?
- I don't know.
You'd have to ask Phil.
Don't say anything about Jeannette.
Who am I gonna tell?
- You and Daddy fighting?
- No, it's not a fight.
- Daddy doesn't look too happy.
- Mmm!
- Good night.
- Good night.
Jesus.
You're acting like a five-year-old kid.
- I know.
I know.
- It's wonderful when you're in the mood and I'm in mood.
But, God!
It's not much fun when you make me feel like it's an obligation.
I know.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Besides, we had sex this morning.
What do you want?
Guess I'm not much fun to live with, am I?
Are you okay?
- I don't know.
- What is it?
I don't know.
I just... find myself-
I just
- I'm anxious all the time, you know.
About what?
I just
- I'm fantasizing and-
- About what?
- Uhh.
About changing my life.
Quit Wall Street, go be a disc jockey somewhere.
I don't know.
- Tired of your job?
- I'll tell you something.
I've been the takeover type all my life.
I mean, in school, in the navy... probably with you, certainly with Patti.
- There's nothing wrong with being a strong man.
- That's the point.
- I'm not a strong man.
I don't feel like a strong man.
- You are!
Well, I feel tired.
I don't know what to say.
You should see a psychiatrist.
Really.
I-I don't think so.
Is it me?
Are you tired of me?
I love you.
Aww.
I'd hate to join the crowd.
Why?
What do you mean?
Oh, Elaine's boozing a lot.
Jeannette's crazy.
Sue's okay.
She's a strong woman.
- God.
- Well, so are you.
I'm beginning to wonder about me.
Oh, it's so nice to have a man to come home to.
- Is that just luck?
- Yeah.
It's luck and a fabulous body.
Jesus.
Here, three kids in the sixth grade beat their teacher up.
Where?
The Bronx.
- You never have any trouble in school, do you?
- No.
It's a jungle.
It is!
They got guys carrying guns.
Oh, you read too much.
- I what?
- It doesn't really happen that way.
Well, it doesn't happen where you go to school, because we got you in a pretty good school.
- It's costing me a lot of money.
- Oh, I'll go to public school.
- Okay.
You're on.
- Okay.
- You think that's funny?
- We'll buy you a gun, send you to public school.
- I'm sorry.
I'm getting tickets to the ballet a week from Friday.
Do you want to go?
- I don't know.
Let me ask Phil.
- Phil can come with us.
Only if he pays.
- I don't think Phil likes ballet.
- I don't either.
I'm goin'.
Good for your soul.
No.
I think I'll pass, Mom.
- Listen, am I a nagging father?
- No.
You're just feeling the loss of separation.
I'm not your little girl anymore.
Wash your mouth with soap!
- Hey, no physical contact, please!
- Got to go.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Do you think Daddy's worried about getting old?
- Are you taking a psych course this year?
- Mm-hmm.
He's always joking.
Never seems to take anything seriously, you know.
You mean, he doesn't take Phil seriously, and that bothers you.
No, it doesn't.
I don't take Phil that seriously either.
Oh, I think you're serious about Phil.
Mom, I'm still a virgin, if that's what you meant.
It's not what I meant.
But I'm glad you told me.
- I just meant that you like Phil.
- I like Phil.
I'm not gonna marry him.
I'm never getting married.
- You will.
- Don't be so sure.
- Why not?
- Why should I?
Everybody I know who's married is either miserable or divorced.
- I don't want that.
- Oh, Patti.
That's ridiculous!
- There's a lot of happily married couples.
- Name three.
- Uhh.
- Uh.
- I'll have to think about it.
- Yeah.
See you later.
383 West Broadway, please.
Now, if all this stuff wasn't done by a woman...
I don't think you could sit in the same room with it.
It isn't "stuff," Charlie.
It happens to be art.
You're a classic male chauvinist pig.
I know, but I'm cute.
- You're out of style, Charlie.
- Want a bite?
Uh-uh.
You're a beautiful woman, Erica.
- But you're leading such a sheltered life.
- How can you tell?
It's in your eyes.
You can tell everything in a woman's eyes.
Oh.
Can you tell everything in a man's eyes?
Men cover it up.
Women lay it all on the line.
Right there in the old eyes.
What do you see in my eyes, Charlie?
- Want me to be honest?
- Yeah.
You're not gettin' enough.
I think you ought to have your eyes examined.
Oh, no.
No, you're not really satisfied.
I mean, your old man's okay and all that, but, uh... underneath it all you're frustrated.
Go paint a still life, Charlie.
- You ever had an affair?
- It's none of your business.
Oh, man.
What a shame.
What a waste!
A woman as beautiful as you should be tasting a little variety in life.
Imagine if all you ever ate was apples?
Imagine never tasting a peach or a pear?
A papaya?
Huh?
No way, babe.
Same thing with sex.
I'm allergic to papayas, Charlie.
How about a nice, fresh guava?
Huh?
- Huh?
- Leave me alone.
- Don't you ever think about anything else, Charlie?
- Yeah, like what?
Ohh, there's literature and ballet...
- and theater and dance...
- Hey, hey, hey, Erica.
- And architecture-
- Erica.
Hey, listen.
There's work, there's food, and there's sex.
That's the whole ball game.
Rowan Gallery.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
I'll meet you.
Um, 15 minutes.
Okay, honey.
Bye.
Might I inquire as to who "honey" is?
My husband.
I'm meeting him for lunch.
Well...
- think I'll hit the streets for awhile.
- Bye, Charlie.
- Hi.
- Is this together?
Uh, yeah, he's paying for me.
That'll be $3.95.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Mmm, I wanted to talk to you about something.
I think that if we're gonna go to the island this summer... that we really ought to get on it right away.
How would you feel about sharing a place with Sue and Harold?
- How's the market?
- Huh?
Just wanted to see if you were paying any attention to me.
- You want to share a place with Sue and Harold.
- Think you could handle it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Well, I'll talk to Sue, and maybe the four of us could drive out in a couple of weeks.
We really should get on it right away.
Jesus, it's gonna be even more expensive this year.
You know, if we do take a place... we're gonna have to have my club up there.
I could just see us, all lying in the sun, blabbing away.
I mean, we would- We talk.
We really do.
I love our meetings.
They're so
- I don't know.
I just love them.
It's sort of like a continuing story, you know.
It's part Mary Hartman and part Ingmar Bergman.
I
- I love the women.
Marty.
Marty.
Come on.
What is it, honey?
What's the matter?
What is it?
- Th-What?
Tell me!
- I'm in love with somebody else.
I've been seeing another woman... for over a year.
Andatfirst,you know, I thought it was just a-a fling.
But it isn't.
I love her.
I want to live with her.
Oh, God.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt Patti.
But I-
I can't-
You don't know her or anything.
Her name is Marcia Brenner.
She's a
- She's a teacher.
She's, uh, 26.
I met her
- I met her at Bloomingdale's, for Christ's sake.
I was standing there buying a shirt, you know.
And she, uh-
She was standing next to me.
She asked me, uh... if I liked the shirt that, uh, she was buying for her father.
Oh, God.
I'msosorry.
You tell Patti- You tell Patti that you're sorry.
I'm in love with her.
Ohhh.
- She a good lay?
- Oh, she-
The first thing we have to do is get you a good lawyer.
I just can't believe it.
I really liked Martin.
- This is not a time to pity Martin.
- I am not pitying Martin.
Move fast, Erica.
Don't let the thing drag on.
That's what I did.
It just hurts more and more.
- Get it over with.
- I don't agree with you.
There's nothing to talk about.
The son of a bitch walked out on a magnificent woman.
The son of a bitch may walk right back in in a month or two.
It sounds to me like this thing's just sexual.
Would you take Harold back if he told you he was having an affair?
Oh, hon, Harold has affairs.
He doesn't tell me about 'em.
I don't give a damn, as long as we respect each other.
That's kind of a weird contradiction, isn't it?
- My marriage isn't based on a king-sized bed.
- Neither was mine.
I know it wasn't.
There was a lot of love there.
That's why I'd hate to see it wasted if there's any hope.
- There's no hope.
- You want him back?
Would you take that miserable bastard back?
No.
- I don't think so.
- "Think"?
You have doubts?
- Of course, she has doubts.
- Look, all I know is...
I feel completely and totally alone.
- That'll pass.
- Not if she sits on it, it won't.
Depression has a way of getting nice and comfortable.
There are days I really enjoy my black moods.
- It's like curling up with a good detective story.
- Merde.
How would you know if you were never there?
Hey, honey, these old bones have known plenty of misery.
But I make it a point to get busy as soon as I feel the blues comin' on.
Oh, God.
It was so much easier in the '60s.
We had Vietnam, assassinations, the Black Panthers.
There was a hell of a lot to do.
Can even find a decent cause these days.
We could use a good war.
I could use a double vodka martini.
- Patti's so sad.
- She has a right to be.
So do you.
I'm sad, Elaine.
I'm sad.
I'm lonely.
I'm depressed.
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?
Where you goin'?
See you guys next week.
Well, let me ride home with you.
- You sure you're all right?
- I'll call you later.
I think we made her feel worse than she did.
I don't think that marriage is over yet.
I hope Martin gets a permanent case of the clap and his pecker falls off.
- Hello.
- Fuck you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I had a fight with Phil.
What about?
He was defending Daddy.
He doesn't think it was the right thing, but he understands him.
Phil's a nice boy.
- I hate Daddy.
- He didn't leave you.
He left me.
I still hate him.
You'll get over it.
I don't want to see him again.
Who you talkin' about- Phil or your daddy?
- Both of 'em.
- That's crazy.
Then I'm crazy.
Okay, honey.
Oh, Mom.
- I hate him, Mom.
- Oh.
I hate him too.
Would you take him back?
Do you want him to come back?
Yeah.
I guess so.
It's over, kiddo.
For good.
You'd better get used to that, you know?
- Hello?
Hello, Phil.
No.
Yes.
Star Wars.
Mm-hmm.
No.
Nothin'.
Nothin'.
I thought we went over this?
Mm-hmm.
"Balls," said the queen.
"If I had 'em, I'd be king."
Well, if you won't sue me, Erica...
I'll tell you, uh, off the record... that you're in very good health.
- Why am I tired all the time?
- It's called divorce.
Maybe I should take Valium or something.
Come on.
We'll talk about it.
Huh?
- Did you feel this way, uh, before all this happened?
- Never.
- Never?
- Maybe I should see a psychiatrist, Arthur.
Erica, it's normal to feel lousy when a husband walks out on you.
You'd have to be crazy to feel good.
It's only been a few weeks.
Some time has to pass.
- And I'm not saying you shouldn't see a psychiatrist.
- You're just saying...
- Erica's in good health.
- Mmm.
Are you- Are you seeing other men yet?
No!
Well, don't be so shocked.
I'm not in the mood for men, Arthur.
I wasn't referring to sex.
I mean, companionship.
Oh.
Oh.
There are male companions out there who don't wanna get laid?
Well, you- Well, you could have a drink with me.
Is that a pass, Arthur?
No, it was an invitation to have a drink.
How come I never got an invitation to have a drink when I was married?
Well, I don't know.
I
- I never thought about it.
It's a pass, Arthur.
A definite fucking pass.
My relationship with Hal is totally honest.
He doesn't tell me he loves me.
I don't tell him he's fascinating.
- It's pure sex.
- You always were different.
Not always.
- I've just learned to live with my ups and downs.
- I don't know how you do it.
I like my job.
I like my friends.
I like my holidays.
Oh, I'm going to the Catskills next week!
There's a new swami in town.
You wanna go?
Uh, well, my spiritual life is just fine.
What's spiritual?
There'll be some gorgeous men there.
- What does this Bob do?
- He's a press agent- Broadway shows, movies.
Hal says he's a nice guy.
- If he tries to touch me, I'll break his arms.
- Relax.
- Waiter!
Waiter!
Right here, pal.
These are fantastic.
These are like claws, Bob.
- Oh, yeah?
- Claw things.
- Oh, yeah.
- We'll take all four of these.
- Take 50,000 of 'em, if you got 'em.
- I don't know if I can-
- What do you call these?
- Thank you.
- Claws.
- Claws.
Erica, have a claw.
Unbelievable.
Give her some of those, uh... the shrimp with the, uh-
What do you call the shrimp with the white paper on the end?
- Paper shrimp.
- Paper shrimp.
Give us some of those, okay?
- Okay, anything else?
- That's fine.
Paper shrimp.
Thank you.
Do you work, Erica?
Yeah, I, uh- I work part time at, uh-
The Rowan Gallery in Soho?
- Oh, I've never been there.
- It's a good gallery.
- We could all take a walk there later.
- That would be nice.
- Do you paint?
- No.
I
- I studied painting...
- but I'm not an artist.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm in public relations.
What are you working on?
Well, right now it's a new picture about an ex-Vietnam vet... who comes back to a small Midwestern town and shoots 300 people.
- That should make a fortune.
- I think I saw it.
- I don't think so, Hal.
- I saw it, I'm telling you.
You couldn't.
They haven't made it yet.
- Sounds familiar.
- Erica.
Claire!
Hi!
- It's nice to see you.
- Remember Allison?
Hi.
How you doin'?
- Hey, I called you about a hundred times.
- Yeah.
- You're never in.
- I know.
I know.
Oh, excuse me.
This is, um, Bob.
And this is Claire and Fred and Allison and Elaine and Hal.
- Hal.
I'm Hal.
- Fred.
Nice to meet you.
- How are you?
Glad to know you.
- Can we have lunch next week?
- Yeah.
I'll call you.
- Okay.
I will.
- Want a bear claw, honey?
- Oh, she's full.
- I'm sorry, Erica.
Call us if you need anything.
- I will.
Thank you.
- Please call me.
- Yeah!
I will.
Bye-bye.
Hal, this is great.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
What are those things that would come in this little steamer here?
Waiter,can we have the shrimp with paper?
Bring a couple of Bubble-Up.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- This is crazy.
- Erica, let's take a walk.
- I feel like I've been dim-sum-ed out of my mind.
- I think I'm gonna go home.
- You sure?
- Oh, come on!
- I'll take you home.
- Stay awhile.
- No, I really wanna go home.
- Where do you live?
- You go on, Elaine.
I live in the East 60s.
- Good, I'll take you home.
- Bye.
- Well, let me take you home.
- Bye-bye!
- I'll see you later.
Call you.
- Have a nice time.
See you.
- Boy, that's a nervous lady.
- She has a right to be.
I'm divorced.
Married 11 years.
Two children.
My wife remarried.
She's living out on the island... so I get to see the kids just about every weekend.
When did you get divorced?
It's been... three years.
It was tough at first.
- You feel very disoriented.
- I know.
Yeah, Hal said you were separated?
What happened?
Oh-
My husband left me for a younger woman.
Ha, ha, ha.
He must be out of his mind.
- Are you uncomfortable?
- With you?
No.
Why did you move closer to me?
I don't know.
I-
- I guess I want to be closer to you.
- Don't, Bob!
Uh-uh!
- Why not?
- I said so, that's why.
I-I don't want you to.
- I didn't do anything!
- But you want to, don't you?
- You're paranoid.
- Do you or don't you?
What?
You'd think I was asking you to go to bed with me.
I'm just touchy these days.
I'm sorry.
You sure are.
Maybe I am being less than honest.
I-
- I'd like to see you again, Erica.
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Why not?
- You seem like a nice man.
It-It's not that.
I'm just
- I'm not dating.
- Well, what was today?
- Lunch.
Well, lunch is dating in my neighborhood.
Take a girl to lunch, it's dating.
Uh, you're right.
Lunch is dating.
Oh, God. "Dating." It's a silly word.
You are a very complicated woman.
I'm crazy about you.
You son of a... bitch!
Stop the cab!
Stop it!
You
- Stop the cab!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't-
- Stop it!
Get out, you son of a bitch!
- I didn't do anything!
- Just get out!
Just stop it!
Will you stop it?
Just pull the fuck over!
Get out!
I don't want to see you!
I didn't do anything.
This is ridiculous.
Just take me home!
Wonderful.
This is a wonderful thing to come home to.
- Get out of here, Phil!
Just get out of my house!
- I'm sorry.
Out!
I don't want to talk about it.
- We didn't do anything.
- You just get out!
- We didn't do anything!
- Here's your coat.
You be quiet, Patti!
- No!
He's not going to!
- Get out of the door!
- I want him to stay!
- Mrs. Benton
- Call you tomorrow!
- Patti!
- Mom, what is with you?
Look, you've got- I don't care what you want!
- You can't run my life!
- Oh, goddamn it!
- I hate it here!
I don't want to live here anymore!
- I don't want to live here, either!
- You can't stop me from seeing Phil.
I can!
I can stop you from doing anything I want!
- No, you can't!
I'll run away!
- I don't care if you run away.
What did I do that was so wrong?
Just tell me, and I'll understand.
I don't think you would act like this if your father still lived here.
Act like what?
I wasn't having an orgy or anything!
- You want me to go to the park?
- Hush!
- Get out of the house!
- Okay, I'll go to the park.
- I'll sit on a bench and do it in public.
- Okay, go ahead!
I'd like to see you!
You might as well do it in public!
- You don't have any kind of feeling about anything!
- Fine!
I'll do it!
- I don't know.
- God, what is with you?
I'm sorry.
God.
Oh, God.
It's just confusing.
I
- I'm sorry I screamed at you, Patti.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
I just don't understand why you get so upset.
- I just can't be your father.
- So just be my mother!
Come here.
Come here, honey.
Call Phil and tell him I'm sorry.
Uh, tell him he can come over.
We can have an orgy.
Maybe he's got a friend for me.
How was your date?
My date?
Oh.
We had dim sum.
I was almost raped.
- He made a pass?
- Yeah.
I don't see what's wrong with that.
You're beginning to sound like my date.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Fine.
How 'bout you?
Call Phil.
Okay.
I'm
- I'm afraid.
I'm frightened, you know.
- Mm-hmm.
- I've never been afraid of anything... before in my life.
When I was little, I was-
I don't know.
I was afraid of- that I was gonna get my clothes dirty, or... you know, I was gonna get bad marks on my report.
U-U-Uhh.
I was afraid when I got my period for the first time.
You know, I- Well, I got my period... when I was, uh- when I was 13, you know.
And most of my-Well-
Some of my friends-
Well, my best friend-
My best friend was Karen Fienstein... and she got her period when she was 12, you know.
So I thought there was something wrong with me, because I didn't get my period.
So I had a terrible year from 12 to 13.
You know, I mean, I-I-I-
I thought there was really something wrong with me.
You know, every time I went to the bathroom...
I would sort of, you know,
- Check and see if I- Yeah, if I got my period yet.
- And go look.
And, suddenly I-
O-Oh, I was wearing- I was wearing these... dumb little white lace panties... you know, that my grandmother had given me for my birthday or some-
And, um... suddenly I felt this... wet, warm feeling in my crotch, you know.
And then I-
I felt sort of excited, you know.
But then I felt afraid.
I was afraid.
I was afraid... that I was going to get blood all over the... chair... all over my pants.
Then the bell rang, and then the class got up... and then I saw Karen, you know.
And I smiled, and I winked at her, and I went like that.
And she came over, and she said, "What are you smiling about?"
And I said, "I think I got it." And she said, "Oh, thank God!"
I don't really know why I'm telling you all this.
- I mean, it doesn't really-
- Well.
Those are very scary moments, and you think a lot about that when you're a kid.
It's natural.
- And what's happening now?
- Everything seems very different.
I'm
- I'm not able to... know what's gonna happen.
You know, before I had a sense that...
- life would go on, and-
- Yes.
- Now, it's like every day is like, "Whew!"
- Yeah.
What's gonna happen?
And I don't know how to control it.
- And I don't know-
- Yeah.
I don't know- I don't know what to do.
Your whole life has been disrupted, discombobulated.
And... it's a new life right now.
I mean, what can you do?
You know, you can't live my life for me, can you?
No.
No.
I certainly can't live your life for you.
It's your life.
But what I can do... is to explore it with you and see what's happening now in your life.
Yeah.
Maybe the confusion that you're feeling now... will clear up.
I'm pretty sure it will.
I think, right now, it would be a really good idea if you came twice a week.
But very quickly we'll move into once a week.
Because it's a lot more important what you do out there... than what you do in here.
Mr. Benton would like to meet there at 1:00.
Hello, Mrs. Benton.
Hi.
It's good to see you.
I'm glad you called.
Let me have your coat.
- You look terrific.
- I'm worried about Patti.
She's very angry at you.
Yeah.
Well, she's got a right to be.
I'm seeing a therapist, and I want her to see her too.
- It's expensive.
- That's all right.
- I'll-I'll take care of it.
- Good.
- Well, that's settled.
- Who's the-Who's the therapist?
Oh, her name is Tanya Berkel.
- A woman.
- I don't know any men named Tanya.
Well, that's good.
I think that's- that's good.
Good.
I glad you think it's good.
You really hate me, don't you?
- Yeah.
- I don't hate you.
- Oh, you were always a very compassionate man, Martin.
- Now, wait a minute.
I-
How
- How can you hate somebody that you were in love with for 16 years?
I don't-
It's easy.
If you're trying to make me feel guiltier than I already do...
- you're doing a good job.
- Good.
This is ridiculous.
Why are we having this conversation?
Martin, do you know how many times we made love?
- No.
- No, I don't want to get into that.
I wanna tell you.
At least 2,000 times.
That's counting twice a week for 16 years.
You should put it up on your ticker tape.
I think it's a very interesting statistic.
I wanna know something.
Did you fall out of love with my- my flesh, my body... or me-with Erica?
Did you fall out of love with Erica?
Wait a minute.
I didn't fall out of love with you.
I
- I love you.
I mean, all right, it-it's different now, but I-
I love you.
I can't just erase all those years.
- I'll always love you.
- I was your hooker, Martin.
I was a bright, high-priced, classy hooker.
Upper East Side by way of Vassar hooker... but I was your hooker.
You have a lousy shrink.
How long do you think Marcia's gonna last?
Well, I'm gonna marry her.
The awesome sanctity of marriage.
Listen, if you want to sit up here with me and have a conversation, that's great.
But if you want to have an argument, I think you'd better leave.
- I want to have an argument!
- You're flippin'.
Call Patti.
I never had any self-esteem.
That was the trouble.
I never had any self-esteem.
That was the trouble.
I suppose I thought looks would do it.
Well, I'll tell you.
It is a nice feeling to like yourself.
Bette Davis always had self-esteem.
- Oh.
- So did Katharine Hepburn.
- Mm-hmm.
- Terrific woman.
- Look at this.
- Oh.
- Beautiful.
- It's strange, isn't it?
I mean, where are all the wonderful women that were in the movies in the old days?
Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Joan Crawford.
- Where are all the women?
- Well, we've got, uh...
- Jane Fonda, Barbra Streisand.
- Oh, please.
It's not the same thing.
I'd hate to see Fonda and Streisand...
- in a toe-to-toe with Hepburn and Davis.
- Right.
- There's no contest.
- Different times.
Hi.
- Hi.
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?
- No.
- Uh-uh.
- We were wondering where all the women movie stars are... compared to 20, 30 years ago.
Well, um, I think we're getting to an age...
- where the dominate cult figure is bisexual.
- Oh, God.
- Maybe unisexual would be a more appropriate term.
You mean like Mick and Dylan and David?
- That sort of thing?
- Mm-hmm.
What's so funny?
- Is that good or bad?
- I don't know.
Nobody knows.
- You're entitled to an opinion.
- Well, I'm not bisexual, if that's what you mean.
- Yes, we know that.
- You know, but maybe she doesn't.
How'd we get started on this?
Self-esteem.
I could write a book on self-esteem.
"Self-esteem and the American Woman."
Once divorced... sleeping around, drinking too much... pretending to have a lot of self-you-know-what.
Really having next to none.
- You getting your period, Elaine?
- Sure.
But I also have no fucking confidence.
Here.
Drink this.
Why do people always give you water when you fall apart?
- I don't need water.
I need booze.
- That's a girl.
Don't worry, honey.
Aunt Elaine is just a manic-depressive.
You know, like, uh, Jekyll and Hyde?
I don't think you get enough vitamin C.
- See you guys later.
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.
- Take care.
- She's somethin' else, Erica.
- Yeah, tough cookie.
- She's confused about Martin.
- How is the son of a bitch?
Hey.
We forgot Claire Trevor.
- Jean Arthur, Susan Hayward.
- What about Greta Garbo?
That was before my time.
I liked Rita Hayworth.
She was pretty.
Everywhere I go I see... couples.
I see people holding hands or their arms around each other... cheek to cheek or-
I just feel jealous.
Oh, I have so much to say, you know, at the end of the day.
I tell Patti everything.
I think about her, you know, going away to school and-
I know it's, uh- it's a couple of years away... but I think about it as if... it's gonna happen, you know, tomorrow.
- Yes.
- I-
I guess I'm lonely.
I was very lonely too when I got divorced.
I didn't know you were divorced.
Yes.
And it's certainly okay to feel lonely.
You're supposed to in a situation like this.
It's
- It's what is- what's expected.
It's really okay to feel anything- anger, jealousy... depression.
It's okay to feel.
I
- I feel guilty about my feelings.
Well, guilt is something that I get livid about... because it's kind of a man-made emotion.
And, uh...
I would like to see you... take a vacation from guilt.
Stop feeling guilty for one week.
Just-Just say, "Erica, turn off the guilt."
Just turn it off.
Don't feel guilty.
It doesn't get you anywheres.
It really prolongs the agony.
And-
- I know what you mean.
I'll try.
- Yeah.
And don't feel guilty about feeling guilty, either.
And don't feel ashamed of your feelings.
They're your feelings.
They have no I.Q.
They have no morality.
They're your feelings.
Just feel 'em.
When were you divorced?
I was divorced three years ago.
But let's get back to you and loneliness.
When you were married, did you ever feel lonely?
- No, not really.
No.
- When you were married, did you feel lonely?
Never?
No.
Well, sometimes, but I wasn't scared then, you know?
This scares me.
It is scary.
It's a whole new way of life.
Did you ever find yourself wanting to be alone?
Yes!
But I knew it wasn't gonna be forever.
Does it feel to you as if this is gonna be forever- the way you feel now?
Well...
I haven't had sex for seven weeks.
It's been seven weeks since Martin left.
I always took sex for granted.
Are you feeling sexy these days?
Hardly.
And, uh-
- What was I saying?
- Sex.
Oh, yes.
I was hoping you'd forgotten.
Um... well, we just had a pretty good sex life, you know.
I just
- It was very-
This isn't fun.
No.
I just-
- I enjoyed sex.
It was
- It was nice.
- Mm-hmm.
We were pretty... wild, Martin and me.
Mm-hmm.
Tell me what you mean by that.
Wha-What do you mean, you were pretty wild?
Well, we had a good sex life.
What exactly was it like?
Jesus!
What do you think happened?
What happens?
You sound pretty angry.
What's that all about?
If I knew that, I wouldn't be here.
Well, what are you gonna do about it?
You're looking at me as if I have the answers.
I don't have the answer for you.
I can tell you what I would do... if I were me and I were in your situation.
What?
Well, one thing, I'd do a lot of what you're doing already.
I'd be a
- I'd spend a lot of time with my friends... as you're doing.
And I'd also sort of take myself by the hand... and say, "Come on, Tanya.
Get into the stream of life.
"Get back in there.
"Don't be scared of going out with guys.
Let's open the door and walk out and get in the stream of life."
- Men, huh?
- Yeah, men.
I'd risk it.
I'd risk it with some new men.
They're people, you know.
I think you could enjoy them.
Take a chance.
Yeah.
I guess I should.
Ugh.
- Can I help you?
- I'll have a glass of white wine, please.
Two beers, Tom.
- Erica!
- Hi!
- Come, join us.
- Okay.
It's good to see you.
Erica Benton, Edward Thoreaux.
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.
Erica works over at the Rowan.
Oh, really?
I haven't seen the new show.
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it.
Edward just got back from a year in Rome.
He's a painter.
How was Rome?
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it.
I loved it.
How are you, Erica?
Oh, I'm a little weird these days.
- I'm getting divorced.
- Ah, I'm surprised.
- Why?
- You seem like such a normal person.
Compared to me, that is.
It's the normal people who are getting divorced.
Nobody else bothers to get married.
If I got married every time I thought it was serious, I would be in lots of trouble.
How are you?
The work I'm doing is nice.
Edward and I are definitely an item.
- So life is good.
- One hates to be thought of as an item.
Hey, what's happening, babe?
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Jean, how ya doin'?
- Hi.
My name is Edward Thoreaux.
- Charlie.
Nice to see you.
- How do you do?
- Were you slumming?
- I wasn't up till now.
What does she want from me?
There's a party at Tom Whalen's loft.
Do you want to come?
Tom Whalen?
You mean the guy who paints the turtles?
- Yeah.
- I pass.
Thanks.
- Erica?
- I don't think so.
It was nice to meet you.
Arrivederla.
Arrivederla, my ass.
Listen, what are you doing out by yourself?
Where's honey?
- We're getting divorced.
- No shit?
What happened?
He was buying a shirt in Bloomingdale's, and he fell in love.
- Am I supposed to be sorry or what?
- No.
- Buy me another glass of wine, Charlie.
- Be right back.
Take me to your loft, Charlie.
Well, you want a cup of coffee?
Something to eat?
- Uh-uh.
- A bottle of Chianti in the kitchen.
Charlie, let's just do it, okay?
Now, before I change my mind.
Okay, okay.
Let's just get something straight right off the top, babe, huh?
I don't get involved with my women.
I'm a short-term guy.
I don't fall in love.
I don't wanna get married.
- Right.
- The only thing you can count on me for is sex.
I am what I am.
I make no bones about it.
Charlie, I'm very nervous.
Your talking is just making me more nervous.
Okay.
- You havin' trouble?
- Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Here.
Here.
Wait.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Just a second!
You got your thing caught.
- My necklace is in it.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
Careful.
There we go.
Oh, what a disaster!
Cheer up, will ya?
Yeah.
Ahh.
The maiden!
Delightful.
Delightful.
Will you stop actin' like some kind of virgin, huh?
Yoo-hoo?
Miss?
Yo!
Ah, here you are.
Hi.
Charlie, I've only slept with one man in 17 years.
Jesus, I was wrong.
I could've sworn you've had a few affairs.
Oh, man, what a beautiful body.
Come here.
Cheer up, will ya?
This is your party.
I'm a little embarrassed.
- When does she stop?
- Ow!
What happened?
An injury.
- What's the matter?
- A splinter.
- Where?
- In my toe.
A splinter in the toe?
The foot doctor's here.
Let me see.
Let me see.
First we'll have to remove the outer garments.
Oh, yes.
Ah, what a lovely piece of equipment.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Huh.
You like that, huh?
You like that, don't you?
Your turn, baby.
Hmm?
You gonna turn me on?
- That was nice.
Very nice.
- I have to go.
I'll see you tomorrow night, okay?
- No.
- What's the matter?
You mad at me?
- No.
- Come back tomorrow night.
- Uh-uh.
- Why not?
I don't fall in love, Charlie.
I'm a
- I'm a short-term guy.
I'll tell you one thing.
Your ex-old man's a fuckin' asshole.
Good night, Charlie.
Hi.
Wait a minute.
I want to talk to you.
- Call me.
- Hey, come on.
Hey, you wanna give me a heart attack or what?
Jesus, Martin!
What do you want?
Well, I just wanted to tell you that I had a nice talk with Patti.
- She's okay.
- I know.
How are you?
I got laid last night.
- Remember Billy Higgins?
- Uh-uh.
Yeah, you do.
He's that big, tall, blond guy, worked for Merrill Lynch.
- Tennis player.
About my age.
- Right, right.
Yeah.
He had a heart attack last week.
He dropped dead.
- That's too bad.
- You look good.
Would you try to have a linear conversation, Martin?
Look, wait a minute.
I just want us to be friends.
I mean, if not for my sake, then for Patti's.
I don't wanna be your friend!
- What the hell do you want me to do?
- Just leave me alone.
Well, Billy was supposed to go out to L.A.
- Now they want me to take his spot.
- Take it.
- Well, it means I'd have to move out there.
- Good.
If I do go out, can Patti come out and spend some time with me?
You'll have to ask Patti.
Herbert, what do you think?
It looks a little high on the right to me.
High on the right.
Hmm.
What do you think?
I-I think the whole thing is too high.
I like it where it is.
Ifyoulikeditwhereitis, then why did you ask me?
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Where would you like to go for dinner?
I can't, Saul.
My daughter's coming home from school.
We're eating at home.
- Well, give her a call.
Tell her to join us.
- No!
- Well, she doesn't have to know I'm your lover.
- You're not my lover.
Well, uh- You, you know what I mean.
I'm not very good at hiding my feelings, Saul.
What are your feelings?
Well, I
- I just slept with a man that I barely know.
- I mean, casual sex is not my-
- No, no.
- I-I don't-
- No, it's not
- I don't sleep with every woman I meet.
I'm experimenting.
I'm- Well, I know it sounds a little cold... but that's... the way it is these days.
I just want to see how it feels to make love to someone that I'm not in love with.
How does it feel?
Sort of empty.
Well, at least you're honest.
The sex was very good.
You're a very nice man.
You have a bizarre way of handing out a compliment.
It was the best I could do.
Why did you flirt with me at the gallery?
I think it was mutual.
Ah, silly games we play.
There's no need for them, you know.
- Do you want to know how I really feel?
- Yes, I do.
As soon as the sex was over, I wanted to leave.
- That's very hostile.
- I don't feel hostile.
I like you.
Perhaps you'd better go home.
I'm getting a very big headache.
My husband used to get headaches whenever I didn't want to have sex.
Poor bugger must have had migraines.
- You-You got a coat?
- Yeah.
I'll see you later.
- Behave yourselves, ladies.
- Oh, yeah?
- We'll try.
- I'm always good.
Just show me the bar.
- Ah.
- That did it.
I've gotta go home pretty soon.
- Hello, Erica.
- Hi, Edward.
Nice to see you.
- These are my friends.
This is Elaine Liebowitz.
- How do you do?
- Edward Thoreaux.
And Sue Miller.
- How do you do?
- And Jeannette Lewin.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Erica.
- Can I take your coats?
- You look wonderful!
- Thanks.
I'm Jean Starret.
Erica has told me about your, uh, club.
This is Jeannette and Elaine and Sue.
- What club?
- Do you know anything about consciousness raising?
- Not really.
- Neither do we.
We just kind of get together once a week and complain a lot.
- That's very American.
- Aren't you an American?
I'm from Cleveland, but I try to forget it.
- I was hoping you'd show up.
- How's your headache?
I had it ever since you left.
How's the party?
Usual.
Well, whenever you put about 50 artists together in one room... you get a really pleasant combination... of gossip, paranoia, envy, fear, trembling... hatred, lust and pretense.
It's, uh, wonderful.
Tell me some good gossip.
Good gossip, eh?
Hmm.
Oh.
You see the short, wiry fellow in the corner?
The one with his arm around Lady MacBeth?
Well, his name is Conrad Zweiback.
He's Hungarian.
Very intense.
Very ambitious.
- Can't paint for shit.
- Who's the woman?
She's the wife of Henry Gebhart, the critic.
- Oh, I've never met him.
- Oh, he's a spider.
Sets traps for young artists, using his wife as bait.
- Is he gay?
- Oh, no.
No, not at all.
That would make sense.
No, it appears he likes to watch his wife make love to other men.
Now, if the other man is pleasing to Lady MacBeth... he becomes the new discovery of Gebhart.
- How do you know all this?
- I was discovered by Henry Gebhart.
I'm kidding.
No, but it's true.
The story's true.
- You're very beautiful tonight.
- You look very good yourself.
Shall we dance?
You're full of surprises.
Remember, we don't really know each other.
- Tanya!
- Erica!
- How great to see you here.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm an old friend of Jean Starret's.
- Ohh.
And I'd like to have you meet my friend, Sophie Windham.
- Hello.
- Erica Benton.
Uh, this is Saul Kaplan.
Tanya Berkel.
- Hi, Saul.
- Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- And we're looking around for Jean, so we'll go along.
- I think she's back there.
- Okay, but I see something to eat in there, so we'll go in there.
- Okay.
- See you later.
Have fun.
- Who was that woman?
- Oh, that was no woman.
That was my therapist.
- Having a good time?
- Yeah.
You?
- Hey, what do you say, babe?
- Charlie!
God.
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah.
Charlie tells me he's a great artist.
Uh, this is Elaine, and this is Jeannette.
- Hello.
- This is Charlie.
- Hello.
- This is Saul Kaplan.
Saul Kaplan?
The Saul Kaplan?
Oh, let me get over there.
Hey, this is a real honor.
I mean, really!
Hey, I bow at your feet, man.
Now, this guy's a real fucking artist.
Thank you.
You may rise.
- Thank you.
- You're drunk, Charlie.
Yes, and stoned.
Great combo.
- Is he dangerous?
- Oh, ask her if I'm good, babe.
- Shut up, Charlie.
Jesus!
- Ohhh, we really got it on one night.
I mean, dynamite.
And she slams the door in my face.
What did I do to deserve such a rotten fate?
I balled my ass off;
the lady won't see me again.
- It's getting to be a '60's party.
- What, is it raining?
What happened?
What happened?
- Why don't you go home, Charlie.
- Why don't you fuck off!
- I'll wipe the floor with you.
- Up yours!
- Come on.
Let's leave.
- No, no.
No.
He leaves.
We stay.
Oh, I get it.
You're ballin' her too.
If you don't mind your dumb fuckin' manners-
I thought you were gonna kill him.
No, I wouldn't give the bastard the satisfaction.
If he made the front page of the Daily News, he'd end up famous.
His work is good, actually.
I was surprised.
Well, you can be a bastard and have talent.
Where'd you see his work, eh?
His place.
You disappointed in me?
I don't know you well enough to be disappointed in you.
But if you ever do it again, I'll kill you.
You're a strange man.
No, I'm a simple man really.
Got very simple tastes.
I like Titian, Rembrandt, Botticelli, Kojak...
Camembert cheese... expensive shoes-
I have bad feet-
London, Vermont, New York about half the time.
And being madly in love.
And I've been without that for a long time now.
What's so funny, eh?
What the hell are you laughing at, eh?
I bare my soul, and you laugh at me.
What is it?
You stepped in dog shit!
I think this is poodle shit.
Oh, yes, after a while, you can tell one kind from another.
I can even tell the difference between an East Side dog... an uptown dog and a Village dog.
Now, East Side dogs shit only the best... and Village dogs shit art.
In London, they don't shit at all, you know.
I don't think they're allowed to, no, no.
In London, I think they have an underground passage where all the dogs shit.
I was born in London, you know.
My mother and my father had a shop near Stepney Green.
That's the Lower East Side of London.
One day when I was about six, my parents had a row, you know.
My mother, she threw a pickled herring at my dad, and it, uh, missed.
Splattered all against the wall.
I took one look at that pickled herring... and that's when I decided to become an abstract expressionist.
Your work does remind me of pickled herring.
Mmm.
Hey, I want to know about that man you lived with.
Were you passionate with each other?
- You mean sexually?
- I mean in every way.
Well, we were married for a very long time.
- Well, I was married for nine years.
- Really?
Eight of those years were very passionate.
Well, "passion's" a mild word for it, really.
It's-Well, it was more like war.
How did your marriage end?
Not with a whimper, but with a bang.
Matilda
- Her name is Matilda-
She wrote poetry for her soul, and she swam a hundred laps a day for her body.
Now, this was after we had the two children.
- Boys?
- My son is 12.
My daughter's nine.
Well, one day I came home, and I found her in bed... with a high diver from the local pool.
- Oh, God.
- I wanted to kill the poor sap, but something kept me from it.
- What?
- He was about seven feet tall.
Oh, you know something?
I-
I wasn't angry.
I felt relief, really.
I was glad it was over- for both of us!
Well, I wasn't a very good husband.
My work means everything to me.
I don't think I believe that.
Don't you miss your children?
I love them.
Sometimes I miss them.
But I see them every summer.
We have a place up in Vermont.
You'll like it.
You seem to have my life worked out for me.
For us.
I want you.
- You know that?
- Yes, I'm getting the message.
Do you want me?
My head tells me to slow down.
But I don't think my pulse is normal.
You know, there are three things that we could do right now.
You could call a taxi and go home.
Or we could go on walking, and, uh, I could lecture you... on the real dilemma of modern art.
Or we could go to my place, and we could thoroughly enjoy each other.
You want hot sauce on your eggs?
Please.
- Grated cheese?
- Everything.
I feel great.
I feel... happy.
I-I don't know what's going on.
This is craziness.
I don't understand anything anymore.
I feel
- I like to do things, you know.
- I want to travel.
- We'll travel.
I want to see Greece.
I want to see Persia.
I'd like to go to Tibet.
I'd like to open up a little restaurant.
Nothing fancy.
Just a little something where I sing under a spotlight.
You ever thought about skateboarding?
I do want to go to India!
India I can do without.
Why?
I like a nice bathroom.
I may go back to school.
I may go back to school.
What's wrong with the gallery?
Oh, I need more money.
I don't want to depend on Martin forever.
Also, I could use a real challenge in my work.
Live with me.
That'd be a real challenge.
I could use a challenge in my work.
Living with me is work.
Hey, this is really delicious.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Does it still feel empty?
No, but it tastes like hot sauce.
Why do you only have one child?
Do you want to have a child?
No, no, no.
Well, I had two miscarriages after Patti.
I quit trying.
Why?
Because...
I want to know everything there is to know about you.
Mm.
Paint!
Paint!
Paint!
Please, paint!
- You are the most delicious woman I've ever met!
- I have to go.
- There's something so damn Victorian about you!
Will you ever, ever spend the whole day... followed by the whole night with me in this room?
I don't know!
Look, I'll come over to your place if it's any easier.
There's just something so nice about sleeping... and waking up with a person that you like.
You really know how to rush a girl, don't you?
You really know how to rush a girl, don't you?
Erica, underneath this haunted, driven shell of a man... there lives a warm homebody... who likes to watch TV and chew cashews... while the woman he loves is finishing a good novel.
Sounds like my marriage.
I want to meet your daughter.
- Now?
- Whenever.
Come to dinner tomorrow night.
Don't know the address.
I like your style.
A girl in my school got an abortion last week.
- How old is she?
- Sixteen.
- It's not that unusual.
- Do I know her?
Mm-mm.
Cost 200 bucks.
She said it was awful too.
The doctor kissed her on the mouth right after the abortion.
- Oh, God!
- Two hundred bucks!
What about her parents?
Do they know?
- No way!
- Well, who paid for it?
We all chipped in.
- What about the boy?
- She was too embarrassed to ask him.
That stinks.
- Here comes Casanova.
- Oh, I'm warning you.
- I'm warning you.
- Shake it.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- All right?
- Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Come in.
This is Patti Benton.
Saul Kaplan.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I saw one of your paintings in the Museum of Modern Art.
Oh?
Did you like it?
I didn't understand it.
- Hmm.
Well, I'm gonna like you.
- She never lies.
How old are you?
- Forty-two.
- You don't look it.
- You look older.
- Patti!
- How old do I look?
- I already know.
You're 15.
- Do I look it?
- You look much older.
Good.
- Can I have some?
- With dinner.
Give her half a glass.
Cut it with water.
- Yeah, that's what the French do.
- We're not French.
Booze is worse than grass.
I smoke grass once in a while.
- So do I.
- Got any?
Now, don't be precocious, Patti.
I'm not being precocious.
I'm just a normal 15-year-old girl.
Actually, I'm not normal.
I'm still a virgin.
Patti, come into the kitchen with me.
Excuse us.
- You're being very rude!
- I guess I'm just nervous.
- This is the first time you've brought a man home.
- Do you like him?
It's too early to tell.
He's cute.
This is-This is really delicious.
Your mother's a very good cook.
How can you tell from one dish?
She made eggs for me the other night.
With hot sauce and grated cheese?
- That's right.
- Hmph.
She really likes you then.
I don't think I'm having fun at this party.
I am.
Relax.
I know that you and Saul are lovers.
It's not funny.
What's the matter?
You always told me to tell the truth.
It's obvious that you invited Saul here to prepare me.
Prepare you for what?
Um, look, I'm the one who asked to come here.
- I wanted to meet you.
- I have a father.
I don't want to be your father.
I'm not marrying Saul.
I-
- Marry him!
I don't care!
- He's my friend.
So marry him.
It doesn't matter to me.
Nobody's asking you to stop loving your father.
Well, you know, it would be easier if Daddy could see me here sometimes.
Okay.
Sorry.
I behaved like a 15-year-old.
I do it all the time.
Good morning.
Hi.
How come you're not jogging?
Oh, I had an early appointment with this guy.
What's, uh-What's up?
Well, I've decided that you can come to the apartment... to see Patti whenever you want.
- Oh, good.
I'm glad.
- Just call first.
Okay.
Oh, I meant to tell you.
I'm not going to California now.
- Why?
- Oh, a lot of things.
Mostly, no money.
Well, you know, I've, uh- I've stopped seeing my therapist, and... well, I'm looking around for a better job, so... the money thing will be a lot easier for you.
We could make it real easy if you want to.
What do you mean?
Well, I broke up with Marcia.
I'm surprised.
Yeah, I am too, kind of.
Well, the truth of it is she left me.
I don't know.
I mean, the minute I moved in there, we stopped having fun.
It's craziness.
I'm sorry.
Are you really?
Yeah, I'm sorry for you.
- I want to come back.
- No.
- Will you think about it?
- No, Martin.
I mean, I was thinkin' you could think of me... as this guy who was sick for a long time, you know, and then recovered.
Think you could do that?
It doesn't work that way, you know?
Yeah.
Patti said you have a boyfriend.
Yeah.
We're goin' steady.
Well, I'll call you.
Bye.
Bye, Martin.
Patti's gonna have to spend more time alone.
Oh, she can cope with that.
Yeah.
I worry about her.
I have to.
I have to.
- You don't have to.
- I do.
I have enough money for both of us.
I don't want your money, Saul.
Look, I'd take your money, if I needed it... and if you had it.
But, you-you're an artist.
Oh, yes.
What's Patti doing this summer?
Oh, she wants to go to summer school.
Well, you know what would be nice- what would be very nice indeed- would be if both of you came up to Vermont... for the whole of the summer.
I can't leave the gallery.
I can't.
He'd let you go for the summer.
Well, maybe for a week, but not for the whole summer.
- It's very beautiful.
- Oh.
Want one?
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, um, one lemon, please.
- Make it two.
- I'm sorry.
No lemon.
Vanilla.
- Okay.
That's all right.
- Fine.
Good.
- Your children will be there, won't they?
- Yes, they certainly will!
Yes.
Well, we'd have a lot of fun.
- Madame.
- Fine.
I can't.
You keep saying you can't.
How much are these, please?
- Twenty cents each, please.
- Twenty cents each.
- "I can't."
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Well, I can't.
- Oh, you can.
What am I gonna do up there?
Watch you paint?
Go fishing?
Go swimming?
Well, it sounds nice, doesn't it?
Ah, yeah.
I'll come up for a couple of weekends.
Life is very complicated.
I've been on vacation for 16 years.
Oh, look, listen.
I-I know you want to get out on your own.
And I approve.
I wouldn't try to stop you.
- What do you mean, you approve?
- What?
- I don't understand that word.
Why are you saying you approve?
- Oh, look.
- I'm not doing this for your approval, you know.
- No, listen.
Let me finish.
- No, that's really not what I have on my mind.
- Please.
All I meant was-
- I hate that.
- Yes.
All I meant was that if-
Well, spending a few weeks with someone you like- that's not out of line.
How do you know?
How can you say that?
How do you know what I need, what I want to do for myself?
I think we need a marriage counselor.
Why don't you come back here every weekend?
Because if I stop painting for a few days...
I may stop painting altogether.
Do you really believe that?
Absolutely.
Men!
Women.
You know what I did yesterday?
I threw out a whole new jar of blackberry jam.
Martin loved blackberry jam.
I think the problem was that I didn't do things as myself, you know.
I did things as this-
Martin and Erica, Martin and Erica.
It wasn't his fault.
I
- I liked it.
Saul and Erica will be different from Martin and Erica.
- You want to see other women?
- I want you!
- You're free to.
- I don't want to.
Then don't.
Do you want to see other men?
Not today.
I'm getting a headache.
I have to go back to work.
So do I.
Would you rather go back to bed?
Mm-hmm.
Yes?
This thing needs oil.
See, I'm gonna put those pillows, you know, from the sofa around there.
- Mm-hmm.
- Carpet.
- Has a lot of outlets.
- Yeah, a lot of outlets.
Ta-da!
Another fireplace!
It's nice, isn't it?
- I can afford it.
- Then take it.
I don't know what to do with Saul, you know.
He wants me to go to Vermont.
He goes there for five months!
- Then don't take it.
- You're a lot of help.
Why don't I go to Vermont?
You stay here, work your ass off and be sensible.
I'll go pick berries and dance in the woods with Saul.
It's confusing, Elaine.
Since I started taking Lithium, I feel more sensible than this month's Good Housekeeping.
No more black, moody lows.
But I sure as hell miss my highs.
- You want my advice?
- Yeah.
Do you know how rare a man like Saul is?
You know how many jerks there are out there?
He's smart.
He's funny.
- Is he a good lover?
- Eh.
Start packin', honey.
I finally settled down.
I gotta tell you this.
Oh, it's crazy.
It's okay, honey.
It's really okay.
You're looking very beautiful.
But you're traveling awfully light.
How do you pack pickled herring?
I'll definitely come up for holidays.
Do you know what it's like up there in the woods all alone?
- Paint.
- Hmm.
Perhaps I'll find some nice, warm moose to keep me company.
Am I only a sexual object to you?
No.
No, you're a bright, willful, curious woman... who is also a sexual object.
I hope it's the hottest... muggiest, most miserable summer on record.
You're so damn stubborn!
I'm not.
I'm really not.
Come with me, for Christ's sake!
I can't.
- Independent.
- Trying to be.
Woman.
- Vicious.
- No.
Honest.
You're driving me crazy.
Okay, Mario, I've got it!
- Will you hold this a minute?
- Yeah.
- Have you got it?
- I got it.
- Bye.
- What about this?
- Oh, that's for you.
- How the hell am I gonna get it home?
Take a taxi.

Son of a bitch.
Anyway, the cop is sitting there, sipping his coffee, you see?
And he's scratching his head.
He's completely confused by now.
-He says to the drunk...
-How's it going, Philo?
..."What about the guy in bed with your wife?"
And the drunk says, "The hell with him.
Let him make his own coffee."
You get it?
"Let him make his own coffee."
Excuse me.
That's funny, but don't give up your day job.
Come on, Big Al.
Let's have some fun.
You want to go some place?
-Hey, Big Al.
Are you married?
-I used to be.
MAN:
I know this place in the valley.
We could go get a couple drinks.
Lots of action there.
Great fun.
What do you say?
Hey.
Put them back.
-You talking to me?
-This ain't the Salvation Army.
Put them back.
I got plenty of peanuts, Big Al.
-You mean these?
-Yeah, asshole.
-Unless you're taking them to your tree.
-Shit.
Excuse me, gents.
The squirrel is taking his peanuts up to his tree.
The squirrel is ripping off peanuts, ain't you, squirrel?
Going to take them up to your tree?
MAN:
All right.
MAN 2:
Come on, guys.
Knock it off.
MAN 3:
Get him!
Attaboy!
-Come on, get out of here, you guys.
-Get him.
MAN 2:
Outside.
Come on, guys.
Outside!
[Every Which Way But Loose by Eddie Rabbitt playing]
Hey, Orville, what's doing?
Ma's going to try it again.
I should have remembered my wig.
You think it'll make any difference?
I don't know, Ma.
I don't expect that's all they're going to be looking at.
Don't be in such a fired, big hurry.
I want to look at these pictures one time more.
I always did have trouble with these squiggly lines.
I hope you pass it this time, Ma, because there ain't too many more... of these places we can go to.
They all know you.
They don't know how I drive.
Don't none of them know how good I drive.
Been driving since before them sons of bitches were born.
Come on, get out.
Here.
You're getting pretty tricky, Clyde.
You've done real good, Ma.
Meathead.
Waited till I passed the whole test before he tells me I'm too old.
I should have remembered my wig.
The hell with everybody.
Come on, get going, for God's sake.
-Philo, are you out here?
-No, I ain't.
What are you doing?
Are you working on the car?
Orville, that's two dumb questions in a row you've asked me.
Here.
Help me put that block under the car here.
-This one here?
-Yeah.
You want it under the wheel or under the spring?
Under the spring.
There you go.
-Thanks.
-Sure.
Ma's pissed.
It's Clyde.
He got out this morning, came over, and shit all over everything.
How did she get him back?
That's what she's pissed about.
She had to bribe him with all her Oreos.
Well, I'll make it up to her.
-You got one going tomorrow?
-Yeah, you coming?
Sure am.
Who wants some action around here?
-There you go, my man.
What's the name?
-$40.
-Name?
-John Hatfield.
I got you, my man.
Thank you.
Who else?
How much you want?
Quick, talk to me, my man.
-Give me $80.
-$80.
Let me see that.
-Name?
-Jackson.
All right, listen, I've got $100.
Who wants to make a side-bet, here?
Come on, guys.
Talk up!
He may be good, but he ain't no Tank Murdock.
Take it.
-We won't have anything--
-Take it.
You're on.
-Who's gonna hold this?
-You hold it.
No problem, you're fine.
Church, let's go, man.
You got him.
Come up here, Clyde.
There you go.
Put this bum away!
Thank you. $5, $100 and $200... $500, $600, $900....
PHILO:
Clyde could have beat him.
[Singing Send Me Down To Tuscon by Mel Tillis]
I kind of like this.
That one's a redhead.
-I'll take the one on the left.
-All right.
The one stuffing her face with chowder.
Let's go over there and see what she's drinking.
Hi.
My name's Philo.
Do you mind if I sit here for a while?
Suit yourself.
I don't recall seeing you around here.
I've never been here before.
Where do you go when you're not here?
My name is Carol.
I go to USC.
I major in sociology.
I'm here because I'm doing a paper on the country-western mentality.
Well, that just blew five minutes of our conversation.
Well, you asked if you could sit.
You didn't say nothing about talking.
Who are you mad at?
-I don't suppose you have a light, do you?
-No, I don't smoke.
Excuse me.
Orville.
Tell me, just what is the country-western mentality?
Well, if the lyrics of this song are any indication... it's somewhere between moron and dull-normal.
Oh, my....
Jesus Christ.
You are disgusting.
Let's leave.
Go.
What happened?
This wild clam got out of control.
Take it.
Did you see her face?
You could've put a turd in there and she couldn't gotten a better look on her.
Thank you so much.
Now, would you all put your hands together and keep the applause going?
Let's all give a big, big Palomino welcome... to pretty Miss Lynn Halsey...
Taylor.
Thank you.
Okay.
Ready, boys?
[Singing I Seek The Night by Sondra Locke]
Let's get out of here.
I want to watch this chick for a minute.
That's awful nice.
Lynn Halsey...
Taylor.
You can come back anytime, honey.
Excuse me.
Could I put this back there for a while?
-Sure can.
-Thank you.
-You sure sing pretty.
-Well, thank you.
I'd really be pleased if I could buy you a drink.
Sure.
-I'd like a beer.
-Two of those.
[Singing Coca Cola Cowboy by Mel Tillis]
I didn't get your name in the introduction.
My name's Philo Beddoe.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?
-She sure ran out pretty fast.
-Oh, her.
I hardly knew her a minute.
A minute?
Well, you must go through a lot of women like that.
-That was a nice song.
Did you write that?
-No.
Wish I did.
Just a song my daddy used to sing to me when I was little.
When you were little?
That's where I know you from.
When I was in third grade I knew a girl that looked enough like you... it makes my memory water.
You sure do talk funny.
Kind of smoky in here.
-Would you like to--
-I'd love to.
Say, it's kind of smoky in here.
So, I decided there was nothing I liked doing better than singing.
-So, here I am.
-Am I glad.
Row 3.
That's my lucky number.
I'll tell you what:
You're my lucky number.
Would you like to... have me in for a while, maybe?
I'd love to.
-Only--
-Only?
-Only my boyfriend, Schyler, is sleeping.
-Boyfriend?
-He wouldn't mind.
-He wouldn't?
So long as you don't drive his car.
Well, I think maybe we could make it some other time when he ain't around.
Okay.
Whatever you say.
Slightly advanced.
Look, man, it's an ape!
Yeah.
Which one's the ape?
-What did you say?
-That looks your girlfriend.
Hey, buddy.
Are you taking your mother for a ride?
-Take that up there, baby.
-Hey.
-So long, apeshit.
-Son of a bitch.
MAN:
What the hell's this?
We'll get them, right, boy?
[Monkey See, Monkey Do by Cliff Crofford playing]
Clyde, get your hands off the wheel.
-Let's get the hell out of here.
He's crazy.
-Follow me.
-Hey, why did you come in here?
-He'll never find us in here.
Get those things out of here.
Roll up your window.
Shit!
Get them out of here.
Freaks!
Hey, man, what in the hell is going on?
-Do you think we ought to stop and fight?
-Nope.
Let's catch that train.
WORKER:
Take it easy.
It's a monkey.
Crazy monkey!
Are you okay?
Thanks, Clyde.
If you don't like him, how come you stay with him?
Because he promised to help me get the $7,000.
[Singing] "Best I can"
-For what?
-"It's hard for me to say no
"to a truck drivin' man"
For the down payment.
-What do you want to buy?
-"Cadillac that I still don't have the time
"Keep the fool who wants to marry me dangling on my line"
My own club back home in Denver.
I'm going to call it the Lynn Halsey-Taylor Drinking Fountain.
"Hard for me to say no to a truck driving man"
That will be the name of my group, too.
I'll have talent night three nights a week.
How much of the $7,000 do you have already?
He won't tell me.
Well, about the only thing of any value I've got is Clyde.
-Clyde?
-Yeah, he's my ape.
-I won him in a fight.
-You won him?
Yeah.
They brought him over here to make a baby.
-You mean he's from Africa?
-No, he's from Sumatra.
When he got here, the other male orang they had on hand... had already done the job.
You're kidding?
Yeah, so Clyde got real mean as hell, so they sold him to a desert zoo.
-Desert zoo?
-One of those places out in the desert... says, "Real, live dragon, cactus candy, five miles ahead," that sort of thing.
That's where I won him.
I bet my truck and two dirt bikes on him.
-You must have wanted him a lot.
-I really hated to see him in that cage.
-So, who'd you fight for him?
-These four guys.
Four guys?
You would have thought after the first couple lost they'd have given up.
-Well, I fought all four at once.
-All four at once?
-You like to fight?
-I used to.
Better than anything.
Well, almost anything.
So, why didn't you turn professional?
None of that stuff.
There's too many rules.
You're just a regular Tank Murdock.
-You know him?
-I know of him.
He's from Denver and he's a regular institution.
You bet he is.
Now that is one guy I'd like to meet up with.
Well, I'd really like to meet Clyde.
And you will.
You will.
Right now we'll meet my friend, Orville.
He's waiting on us.
So, Tank was in the back seat of this car with this debutante.
I mean, her daddy owned the whole town.
-And his buddy was in the trunk.
-And then what happened?
Well, you see, she was so pure... that nobody believed these wild stories that Tank had been telling about her.
-What happened?
-You got to use your imagination, Orville.
Anyway, after... she heard all this bumping around and laughing coming from the trunk.
And she started to scream.
So, all these cops came in, six or eight of them.
Tank tried to explain, but nobody believed him because they all knew him.
He must have put about four cops in the hospital.
It took about 12 of them to take him in.
Man.
-One thing I want to know about the story.
-What?
Who let that poor guy out of the trunk?
Shit, he's probably still there.
Those two creeps over there asked me to bring this to the lady.
This was mighty nice of you.
-Do you see that?
-An arm?
No, that.
A tattoo?
They don't know what this means.
Do you see that?
-Sorry.
-Two tattoos.
Them's black widows.
Did you know that more people die from black widows than rattlers every year?
-Is that right?
-Yeah, that's right.
Well, listen, I sure do appreciate knowing that because... most of the people I know just step on them and squish them.
I don't need this cheap shit.
Orville, that's no way to thank two guys that just bought us a beer.
Why don't you get the check and I'll go outside and thank them properly?
Okay.
-Go ahead.
-You started it.
Shouldn't you go with him?
[Elmo grunting]
[Trash cans crashing]
Sure is good pecan pie.
[Frank moaning]
[Frank grunting]
[Trash cans crashing]
I think we'd better get out of here.
Cut it out, Clyde.
Ma, what'd you do that for?
Been trying to get your attention for five minutes.
Did you see Orville?
-Yeah.
I saw him.
-Well?
Orville tell you what?
Yeah, and I'm sorry, Ma, about you missing your driver's test again.
That ain't the one what I mean.
You mean Clyde?
I'm sorry about that too, Ma.
He won't do it again, I promise you.
-What are you gonna do about it?
-What?
The crap or the Oreos?
About Clyde!
Goddamn it!
I don't have no privacy in my own home no more.
Well, I confronted him about it, Ma.
I guarantee it won't happen again.
No privacy in your own home.
A whole goddamn bag of Oreos.
Stop that, you goddamn baboon.
No respect.
No privacy.
No nothing.
Bang.
-You're late, pretty boy.
-Shut up.
I don't believe this.
Damn.
I never knew nobody who could hit so hard or so fast.
-He could've been Denver Tank Murdock.
-That's right.
-Sound like him?
-Don't know.
Didn't get to see him so close as Elmo.
At least I didn't drop my bike and run.
Like you two!
You big suckers!
Shut up!
Now, it isn't bad enough... that you let somebody else kick your butts... without you trying to do it to each other.
If we're all talking about the same man... and I think we are... then it appears he's got a rather growing collection of our bikes.
Yeah, but we don't know for sure if he took them or not.
-We were--
-Unconscious for two hours!
-Sick son of a bitch.
-It's not true!
Shut up!
The very first thing we do... is find out who we're talking about.
I mean, we don't even know where to find him.
How are we going to find him?
Well, it appears to me that there can't be too many guys... driving around this valley with an ape.
-What you got sticking out here?
-Open it.
-It sure feels heavy.
-Open it.
-Philo.
God, where'd you get this?
-Off a couple little old widows.
-You're kidding.
-Yeah.
More people are dying to buy widow bikes than are dying by rattler bites every year.
Well.
-You like it?
-Well, yeah.
That I do.
Wait until Clyde sees you in this outfit.
-What's the matter?
-I'm okay.
-House not too good tonight?
-I'm okay, Philo.
Well, at least this outfit you bought me was a big hit.
I don't like the way this guy's driving.
Get down!
[Gunshot]
Is that somebody you know?
Schyler.
-I thought you said he didn't care.
-He must have changed his mind.
Philo, I'm scared.
-I won't let anything happen to you.
-That's not what I'm afraid of.
I'm afraid for Schyler.
Please don't hurt him.
Son of a bitch tried to blow my head off.
He didn't care you were sitting next to me.
That's just it.
He was just trying to scare you.
He doesn't even know how to shoot.
I sure don't like the way he's trying to find out.
Philo, I know him.
He's probably in there now... hiding, scared out of his wits.
I don't like to see you cry.
Let me talk to him.
Please.
I don't know.
Please.
For me.
Please.
All right.
You talk to him.
And you tell him that I want you to come with me... and I want you to stay with me, you hear?
Philo.
Here.
I want you to dry those tears.
-I want you to take this.
It's the dough.
-I couldn't take that.
Yes, you can.
I want you to have it now, you hear?
-Okay.
-I don't want you to cry no more.
Clyde, how'd you get out?
What, did you pull the lock off?
How'd you get out?
No, you don't.
Come on.
No, you don't.
Give me that!
Give me it!
What the....
Good Clyde.
Good Clyde.
Just hold that truck up, Clyde.
What are you doing, Clyde?
-Philo.
-Yeah.
Call this son of a....
No, don't call him.
Don't call him.
Good Clyde.
That's it, Clyde.
Hold it up.
How many times have I told you?
I don't want him drinking beer, except on Saturday night.
-Don't expect I'll need these no more.
-Take it easy, Ma.
This is the easy part.
Awful glad there ain't no more of them squiggly pictures.
Good.
Maybe you'll do it this time.
Maybe.
Well, I guess I will.
Why didn't you tell him you wear glasses?
It's none of his goddamn business what I wear.
Just wear them to read, anyway.
Was there anything else?
Told me I was too old.
Meathead!
Orville?
Yes, Mother?
-Next time I'll wear my glasses.
-Good.
Goddamn it.
God, you're a handsome devil.
Clyde, you're going to meet a lady now.
Understand?
I want you to handle it.
That means no spitting, pissing, farting or picking your ass.
You hear me?
Because if you do, I'll throttle you.
Understand?
Man, I'll tell you something.
Clyde, this has got to stop.
People are going to talk, you know?
-What is it?
-That trailer that was parked down there.
What happened to it?
-What spot?
-That spot right over there.
I don't see it.
-Well, where'd it go?
-It's gone.
I know it's gone, goddamn it, but where'd it go?
-Back home, I suppose.
-Denver?
Some folks just don't take me into their confidence.
The plates said Colorado.
Sound right to you?
-When'd they leave?
-This morning.
Thanks.
Goodbye, now.
[Singing Red Eye Special by Larry Collins]
Hey, Philo.
I've got a message for you.
Why don't you watch what the hell you're doing?
Why don't you shut your face, boy?
What have we got here?
A real, live, macho cowboy.
Don't turn your back.
-Somebody call the cops.
-They are the cops.
Shit.
-She didn't say where she was going?
-Nope.
-Well, how do you know where to look?
-I'll know.
Well, how do you know she wants you to come looking for her?
There you go asking those dumb questions again.
-Is Clyde going?
-Yes.
-You got room for one more?
-Yes.
Got you!
I'm coming.
-Which way are we headed?
-East.
Sounds reasonable.
East?
What are you gonna do with the baboon?
Orangutan, Ma.
Clyde's an orangutan.
-What's the difference?
-He has 12 ribs, just like you and me.
-What are you going to do with him?
-He's coming with me.
Come on.
Well, when are you coming back?
-When are you coming back?
-Whenever it's time, Ma.
It don't seem right to leave an old lady alone.
And what about my goddamn license?
This is....
It's just....
Twelve ribs.
I don't believe any of that shit!
This machine is very sensitive.
What do you think you can find out here?
You never know what you can find out here.
Just listen.
It picks up all kinds of metal.
Swiss watches, expensive foreign cameras, silver dollars.
Gold, man.
-Gold?
-Yeah.
-Herb.
-Yeah.
What are we going to do about that son of a bitch?
-Who?
-You know who I'm talking about.
That cowboy at the Palomino Club.
I don't know what you can do about him.
What can we do, man?
You mean to stand there and tell me you'd let him get away with it?
You got anything in mind?
What I got in mind is to break his stupid head.
-Listen, are you sure that thing works?
-Sure it works.
Just keep digging.
Besides, you don't even know where to find him.
Don't worry.
I'll find him.
I got a plan.
-What's that?
-I'm going to use my medical leave.
What are you laughing at?
You're going to spend your two weeks medical leave looking for him?
I'll spend the next two years looking for him if I have to.
-What's up?
-Pit stop.
-Are these cantaloupes fresh?
-Yes.
-Are they today's?
-Yes.
They just came in.
No, I only want a quarter of a pound.
These only cost a quarter a pound.
I only want a quarter of a pound of tomatoes.
Yes, ma'am.
Right.
Can I have a fresh bag now?
I'll take these two cantaloupes.
How much are they a pound?
Cantaloupes are 29 cents a pound.
I think they were cheaper down the road.
I don't know why you're so expensive here.
Ma'am.
[Orville whispering]
[Screaming]
-Can you help me out?
-Sure.
-What's your name?
-Echo.
Echo.
Do you want some cantaloupes?
Those are beautiful.
Thank you.
How many would you like?
Do you live around here?
Yeah.
Down past the wash.
Where's the wash?
How come you want to know so much about me?
Because I never met anyone that made me feel like you do.
Right out of the gate.
-Where are you headed?
-East.
[Six Pack To Go by Hank Thompson playing]
-What's your name?
-Echo.
-What?
-Echo.
Orville.
What did you say, anyway, that made that woman storm away like that?
I told her you had the clap.
All right, spread out.
-Hey, heifer, how's the slop?
-Suits the clientele real good.
Looking real good.
Don't you got no special of the day?
Liver and onions.
Why don't you read the menu?
Maybe I'd rather talk to you.
Has Philo Beddoe been around?
You want to talk, take a walk.
You want to eat, take a seat.
What are you laughing at?
Lard-ass!
I'll tell you what:
You turn around and walk out that door, and I'll forget what you said.
And I won't tell everybody that you drink horse piss.
-Elmo, Cholla, did you hear what he said?
-I heard it.
-I'll just keep this warm for you, Lester.
-Okay, big mouth, let's go.
You want me to keep a piece of that lemon meringue?
Yeah, this won't take but a minute.
Let's go, cutes.
Drinking horse piss.
What is this?
-Hey, come on!
-Get him, come on!
Kick him in the nuts.
Kick him in the shins.
Come on over here.
Give me a hand.
Where you going?
Get back here.
That's it.
Get this little son of a gun right there.
Good.
Hurry up.
Get out of there, Roy.
Look out.
My God.
Spread out!
Goddamn morphadites.
Come on.
Get the hell out of the way.
Hurry.
Let's go.
Move it.
MA:
Who is it?
COP:
The police.
I'm coming.
I'm coming, goddamn it!
What do you want with an old lady?
Ma'am, we're looking for Philo Beddoe.
Our records say he lives at this address.
Well, your records are wrong.
He lives at that address in the back.
What do you want him for?
-Just looking for him, ma'am.
-Well, he don't live there anymore.
He's gone off.
Took that son of a bitch, Clyde, with him.
Clyde?
His ape.
His ape?
You heard me.
What you making me repeat myself for?
Do you know where he's gone?
Who gives a damn?
Stealing all my Oreos.
Crapping all over the place.
Twelve ribs, my ass!
-Thank you.
Sorry to bother you.
-Yeah.
I'm sorry, too, you see.
Leave an old lady alone, fending for herself.
No protection.
It just don't seem....
Well, I don't suppose you know of a ladies' room hereabouts?
They're all over.
Just pick one.
-She's something, ain't she?
-She sure is.
You're full of all kinds of surprises these days.
Listen, I want to say that I appreciate your making her feel at home.
[Echo screaming]
Clyde.
There's something out there!
God, it's horrible!
It's a monster.
-It's not even a bear.
It's a....
-No, Echo, it's just Clyde.
Hey, Echo!
Wait.
Give me....
What?
Take it easy.
You're going to scare him.
-Me, scare him?
-That's right.
PHILO:
Let me introduce you.
Echo, this is Clyde.
Clyde, this is Echo.
Echo.
Did you get it?
It's okay.
See?
-Hey, granny, how they hanging?
-Hey, hot damn.
-What are you doing tonight, honey?
-Let her alone.
She's mine.
I saw her first.
-Say, old lady.
Where's Philo Beddoe?
-How the hell do I know?
Get off my porch with that thing.
Get off my property!
You're not very hospitable.
Hospitable, my ass.
Get off my porch!
Very well.
If you insist.
All right, lady.
Put that gun down!
I'm warning you, lady.
Put down that gun, now!
Wait for me!
First, the police.
I told those boys not to leave a vulnerable old lady all alone.
Hospitable?
Horseshit!
-Police.
-Yeah?
I want to ask you questions about a girl.
Her name was Lynn Halslay-Taylor.
Halsey.
Yeah.
She was here, but she left.
Hey, man.
How come that cat ain't moving?
MAN:
You think he's dead?
Shit, man, if he's the only one here, let's have some fun.
Shut up!
But he's only one old man.
It was only one old woman that nearly ruinated all of you.
Yeah.
Maybe we ought to split.
Hello, there.
You in there?
What is it?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, I'm looking for a girl that used to stay around here.
-She was with a guy named Philo Beddoe.
-Don't know no Philo Beddoe.
Well, the girl's name was Halsey-Taylor.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
She must've been one jim-dandy of a girl.
You're the third one come to ask about her since she left for Denver.
-You don't say.
-Yeah.
[Singing Don't Say You Don't Love Me No More by Sondra Locke]
-Could I put that back there?
-Sure, doll.
It'll be here when you need it.
-Buy you a drink?
-Sure.
Taste that, too.
Here.
Get out of my stuff, Clyde.
Here, take a piece of this.
That's my salad.
Why don't you two take the truck?
Clyde and I are going to go check around.
[I'll Wake You Up When I Get Home by Charlie Rich playing]
-What's going on?
-Orville, you've got to get up.
-Why?
-Because it just isn't right, that's why.
-What isn't right?
-What isn't right?
It just ain't right.
I mean....
I mean, you two have somebody.
And I've almost got somebody.
And it just ain't right.
-Well, what isn't right about it?
-You just don't understand, do you?
Yeah.
He just doesn't understand.
Right, and that's why we've got to do something about it.
We do?
Yeah.
Here.
Off your ass and on your feet.
[Echo shrieking]
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm talking about Clyde, damn it.
You think he doesn't understand.
He sits back there all the time.
You don't think he understands, but he's smart.
And I'll tell you something, Orville.
He thinks about a lot of things besides Oreo cookies.
Right, Clyde?
-You don't mean....
-I mean exactly that.
Where the hell are we going to get Clyde laid in the middle of the night?
Shit.
How the hell do you break into a zoo?
It's easy.
Zoos are meant to keep everybody in.
Listen to that.
He knows something good's gonna happen.
Well, how do you know there's a lady in there for him?
I don't, but if there is one there... and he doesn't find it, he wouldn't know what to do, anyway.
Give me a hand.
Come on.
ECHO:
Well, what do you want us to do?
The place is probably guarded, so I want you to stay here and keep an eye out.
Come on, pal.
Okay.
All right, Clyde.
Up.
Boy, I bet there's a gal in there.
Think there's a lady in there?
You bet, man.
Clyde, you think there's a lady in there?
Come on.
Clyde.
Orville.
When we get to this next town, you should drum up some action.
We're getting a little short on cash.
Sure, why not.
Do you know where the meat-packing plant is?
-No.
But I'll find it.
-All right, I'll see you there.
You got it.
I don't care much for that perfume they're wearing.
-Do they know me here?
-No, it's even money.
-Anything else?
-Yeah.
Guy's name is Kincaid.
He's a local champion.
Taller than you.
About 240 pounds.
I checked.
-And?
-They say he stacks up to Tank Murdock.
Tank Murdock?
You know, like them all, Tank's gonna fall.
And another thing, he fights dirty.
-Orville Boggs?
-You got it.
Okay, open the gate.
It's over there in the cold room.
-How much you want?
-What you got?
-$1,200.
-We'll take it.
You've got to show me something besides conversation.
-I'll take that.
-All right, if I see yours.
What do you want us to do with the body?
Save your breath.
It's enough you'll lose your money.
-Hey, man.
-Hey, baby!
What's up?
I want you.
Come on, Philo, put him away!
ORVILLE:
Don't let him tag you!
What the hell are you doing, Philo?
Come on.
It's getting cold in here!
-I think you owe us some money.
-What money?
Wait a minute.
You aren't gonna tell all these boys that you'll take their money, are you?
That was just so you'd know the first one was no accident.
Did you see this little filly shoot?
Where did you ever learn to do that?
You could shoot a gnat off a water buffalo's ass.
-I told you I could take care of myself.
-She took care of us.
MAN: [On radio] Car 103.
Proceed to the intersection of Interstate 5 and Velasquez Road... for a 602.
MAN 2: 103 here.
Got you, over.
That 602's the same as our 406.
No way.
It's got to be the same as our 309 or at the best our 213.
You're crazy.
No New Mexican 602 can come anywhere near California 309.
When's the last time you been out on a 309?
Maybe three or four months.
But it don't mean that I don't know that our 309 ain't more than that damn 602.
-What time you got?
-6:07.
MAN:
Unit 103, abort that 602, 103.
Proceed to Velasquez Road on Interstate 5 for a 607.
Well, kiss my....
I suppose you think I'm crazy traipsing across the country... after a girl I hardly even know.
Hell, I'm not like Orville.
It takes me a long time to get to know a girl.
Even longer to let her know me.
You know what I mean?
I'm not afraid of any man, but sharing my feelings with a woman... my stomach just turns to royal gelatin.
I don't suppose that ever happens to you.
Well, I guess you just keep howling till sometime they howl back.
If this is a strike, it means Ronstadt and Parton move over.
It's Halsey-Taylor to the top.
It's okay.
It just means it's going to take a little longer.
But we don't give up.
If I get this pickup... it means the same time next year...
Halsey-Taylor has her own special.
That was a mighty fine pickup, little lady.
Thank you.
Will you mind Clyde for me?
I'm gonna go take a run.
All right.
Shit!
Hey, Lynn!
Wait up!
Fancy meeting you here.
Yeah.
Incredible is more like it.
What are you doing?
Following you.
You're here just in time.
All this weather.
You took off so fast I thought there was something wrong.
Bad time to run.
I figured maybe I'd better follow you.
Thought you'd better?
Hell, you didn't even get a chance to meet Clyde.
Pull in right here.
Yeah.
I know where he keeps the money now, so it's a matter of finding the right time.
I still say my way would be quicker.
Philo, you promised.
Please don't make me sorry I told you.
You make me afraid to believe you.
I never want to make you sorry.
You want to come down and meet everybody?
No, I'd better go back.
We'll do it when we have more time.
Tomorrow night?
Like we agreed?
El Patio Restaurant.
Philo?
You're really something.
Bye.
Jesus Christ.
Goddamn, I don't believe what I'm seeing.
I think I'm still asleep and dreaming.
You're not dreaming.
Come on.
Get your ass up.
Hi, Clyde.
How you doing?
Let's let the little lady up.
What did you do that for?
I think he's trying to tell us something.
What's he trying to tell us?
Why are you so all fired happy, Philo?
Listen, the only time I ever see you smiling is when....
You got laid?
You were jogging down there, and you picked up somebody and laid her.
-Did he?
-I'll do you one better than that.
-You mean Clyde got laid again, too?
-No.
I ran into Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
How'd you do that?
I was running down the highway and she picked me up.
-Where is she now?
-She's in town.
She's getting things straightened up, we'll see her tonight
Goddamn, that is good news.
That means we can go home soon.
I don't see why not.
While we're waiting around for true romance...
I think I'll jump down and get some flies.
There's no way I don't want to get in on this action.
-Help me finish these first, will you?
-Right.
Did you ever notice how drinking and fishing kind of go together?
-You sell fishing licenses in here?
-Sure do.
Something about the six-pack and the worms.
-Any good trout around here?
-Four or five miles down the road.
It's a good spot, huh?
Orville.
Don't these look like the humpers Clyde was eating this morning?
Are these the flies Philo wanted?
Grayish yellow.
ORVILLE:
Hey, Philo.
Where's your boat?
I'm going to hang out here on shore.
Echo and I are going on down to the other end here.
-We got him?
-Got him.
Here.
Be careful, it's loaded.
Why the scattergun?
-Because I don't want to miss that sucker.
-Makes sense.
Here.
Why all the fishing gear?
Because we got to look like we're going fishing, dummy.
Now look, I'm gonna go right through there.
You go around the lake and come from behind him.
You got it?
I'm going around this lake--
Damn it.
Not so loud.
He'll hear you.
It's not so far.
And here.
Get going.
Now get going, will you?
Stinking hippie.
Quite a mess of fish.
Shit.
The white boy's the craziest son of a bitch in the world.
Where in the hell is that Putnam?
What are you doing, boy?
Oh, my God!
Feet!
Feet don't fail me now, man.
Goddamn apes, snakes, alligators and shit!
You so much as blink, and I'll blow a big hole in you.
Who are you and what do you want?
Just never you mind.
You'll find out soon enough.
What the hell was that?
Jesus.
Good Lord.
He must be 5 or 6 pounds.
Give him some slack.
Don't jerk, you'll lose him!
God, he's a monster.
Don't jerk him!
Give me that rod!
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
He's a monster!
He's a frigging monster!
I've never seen anything like it before.
He must weigh 25 pounds.
He's a stud!
He's got to be a stud!
Come on, help me here.
Help me.
Boy, he is a stud!
-Have a stud.
-Shit!
Putnam!
Big, dumb galoot.
Putnam, where are you?
Dummy.
[Philo imitating Tarzan]
ECHO:
What was that?
ORVILLE:
I think he's spending too much time with Clyde.
What are we supposed to do with all this stuff?
Eat it.
All of it.
-All of it?
-All of it.
What if I can't?
Then we'll give it to Clyde.
Can you imagine what this stuff would do to Clyde's digestive tract?
He already has enough gas to go to North Denver.
And he's never seen a bean in his life.
[Mimicking farting]
Say, when's your little lady coming here?
She should be along any time.
Let's get out of here.
Listen, Philo.
Does that mean we're going back to L.A.?
Hell, no.
But when I find her...
I'm gonna take care of that guy she's with.
My way.
Hey, an Airstream!
Hey, Cholla!
That's the one!
Howdy?
[Gun cocking]
I bet you're Lynn Halsey-Taylor, ain't you?
How'd you know that?
Well, we been following you, all the way from Los Angeles.
You see me sing at the Palomino?
I'm sorry to say, ma'am, I missed that... but I promise not to miss it next time.
Well, then, what did all you boys follow me all the way to Colorado for?
Do you know a guy named Philo?
Philo Beddoe?
He's been following you.
You know that?
Yeah, I know that.
Is he a friend of yours?
Not particularly.
You want to find him?
Not particularly.
We do.
Now, that's a nice looking truck.
PHILO:
There she is.
You stay here.
This is personal.
Lynn!
You Philo Beddoe?
Do I know you?
You're gonna.
Last time I saw you two, you were going for a fast freight.
The last time we saw you, you were dirt-diving in an alfalfa patch.
Philo Beddoe.
Your time has come.
Here we go again.
I got him.
The bikes, you dummies!
The bikes!
The bikes!
Get him, come on.
Are those guys coming after me?
Those guys are coming after me!
I'll get him!
I'm going to kill you all!
Look out!
Watch out for the truck!
Hi, cutie pie.
Want a ride?
-Don't mind if I do.
-Hop in.
Darling, I'm only glad you happened along when you did.
Nice day for a drive.
-Look at these guys coming up the road.
-I love this.
Ten points.
Get out of the way!
There's the boy.
-Thanks.
-Make sure that door's closed, would you?
Let's go get a bite to eat.
No, you go on ahead.
Clyde and me will eat later.
We'll bring you back something, okay, Philo?
Whatever.
-He's locked into that phone book.
-He must have called every place in town.
ECHO:
What are you hungry for?
Listen, are you sure you don't want me to go in there and just hang out?
-He pulled a shotgun the last time.
-This is personal.
I'll handle it.
Why don't Echo and I just go in and have a beer and listen to the music?
-Do you want to borrow my pea shooter?
-Thanks.
You two go have a good time.
See if you can find out the location of Tank Murdock.
[Singing I Seek The Night by Sondra Locke]
-What will you have?
-A beer.
MAN:
Lynn Halsey-Taylor, everybody.
All right!
It's great to have you back in Denver, Lynn.
And now, everybody, the featured performer of the evening... the star of tonight's show, Mr. Charlie Rich.
The best club out there is the Palomino, and the manager's a good friend of mine.
So, I'll write him, tell him to give you a good spot.
That's mighty nice of you.
[Singing I'll Wake You Up When I Get Home]
Like me?
Want me?
-Let's go.
-Harlan.
I've got a friend.
It's okay, though.
He won't mind, he just might want to come along.
Let's go.
-Is this your--
-No.
You want to talk to him?
The lady and I have a little business.
I expect you'll be excusing us.
Maybe you ought to excuse yourself.
It's okay, Harlan, I'll just be a minute.
-Are you sure?
-Yes.
It's your own goddamn fault!
Who asked you to follow me?
-I just thought--
-You thought!
If you'd thought, you would've taken some very broad hints.
I've been trying to get rid of you practically... ever since the first night we met.
-What about Taos?
-What about it?
I need it just like anybody else.
-You do this all the time?
-Yeah, I do this all the time.
And you and me had our time, so how come you don't know when to disappear?
-Come here.
-Take your hands off me!
Lynn?
Is everything all right?
Schyler, this is the one from L.A. The big, dumb one I told you about.
Schyler, with the shotgun?
That was my idea.
I was hoping he'd scare you away.
Why didn't you just say goodbye?
You're here, aren't you?
Guys like you don't understand goodbye.
What do you do?
You hustle for him?
You're just not too smart, are you?
Why did you have to come?
Why couldn't you quit like everybody else?
You had to come chasing me and spoil it all.
I guess I'm just not too smart, that's all.
Up to now, I'm the only one dumb enough to want to take you further than your bed.
I hate you!
I hate you!
I hate you!
I hate you!
I hate you.
Well, listen, do you want to rest up a little bit?
-You don't have to take him tonight.
-Tonight's fine.
-Are you Philo Beddoe?
-That's right.
Straight down.
Keep on walking, you'll see him.
Here you go.
-Is that all the money?
-That's it.
-What's with this girl here?
-Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, "Don't worry about it"?
MAN:
Right to your left.
Right that way.
Don't worry about it, Philo.
This guy's a real porker.
Look at him.
He's carrying his reputation around his waist.
Looks like you've had a go at it already.
You sure that face won't hurt too much to fight?
-I ain't going to hit you with my face.
-That's funny.
I like you.
Don't worry, kid, we're gonna get this over in a hurry and take care of you here.
Where did you hear of Tank Murdock before, kid?
-All around.
-Yeah?
-They say you're the best.
-They do?
Well, let's get with it.
Jesus Christ, who is that guy?
I don't know, but he's the one that's gonna beat Tank Murdock.
MAN:
Come on, Tank!
Come on, get him!
Jesus Christ, that guy's going to beat Tank Murdock!
MAN 2:
Get up!
Come on!
[Crowd booing]
MAN:
This guy's gonna be the new Tank Murdock!
MAN 3:
This is it for Tank!
MAN 4:
Who is this guy?
MAN:
The new guy's beaten Tank!
You has-been!
You ought to learn to box!
You old bum!
You're all washed up!
MAN 5:
That guy's the new Tank Murdock.
MAN 3:
We're going to make money on this guy.
My champ!
My champ!
MA: "5, Z."
MA:
Just a minute there, now. "B."
Why don't you try that one with your glasses on?
Yes.
Why didn't I think of that?
-There.
Now try it again.
-Thank you, I will.
"5, Z, B, D, F."
-You did it.
-Of course I did.
Now, if you'd please step over there for your photograph.
-My what?
-Your photograph.
To put on your license.
My photograph.
Well, what will they think of next?
I think I forgot my comb.
Don't you worry.
Your hair looks quite lovely.
You really think so?
All right, you ready?
Let me get you focused.
All right, now smile.
Big smile.
[Every Which Way But Loose by Eddie Rabbitt playing]
[ENGLISH SDH]
Son of a bitch.
Anyway, the cop is sitting there, sipping his coffee, you see?
And he's scratching his head.
He's completely confused by now.
- He says to the drunk...
- How's it going, Philo?
..."What about the guy in bed with your wife?"
And the drunk says, "The hell with him.
Let him make his own coffee."
You get it?
"Let him make his own coffee."
Excuse me.
That's funny, but don't give up your day job.
Come on, Big Al.
Let's have some fun.
You want to go some place?
- Hey, Big Al.
Are you married?
- I used to be.
I know this place in the valley.
We could go get a couple drinks.
Lots of action there.
Great fun.
What do you say?
Hey.
Put them back.
- You talking to me?
- This ain't the Salvation Army.
Put them back.
I got plenty of peanuts, Big Al.
- You mean these?
- Yeah, asshole.
- Unless you're taking them to your tree.
- Shit.
Excuse me, gents.
The squirrel is taking his peanuts up to his tree.
The squirrel is ripping off peanuts, ain't you, squirrel?
Going to take them up to your tree?
All right.
- Come on, guys.
Knock it off.
- Get him!
Attaboy!
- Come on, get out of here, you guys.
- Get him.
Outside.
Come on, guys.
Outside!
Hey, Orville, what's doing?
Ma's going to try it again.
I should have remembered my wig.
You think it'll make any difference?
I don't know, Ma.
I don't expect that's all they're going to be looking at.
Don't be in such a fired, big hurry.
I want to look at these pictures one time more.
I always did have trouble with these squiggly lines.
I hope you pass it this time, Ma, because there ain't too many more of these places we can go to.
They all know you.
They don't know how I drive.
Don't none of them know how good I drive.
Been driving since before them sons of bitches were born.
Come on, get out.
Here.
You're getting pretty tricky, Clyde.
You've done real good, Ma.
Meathead.
Waited till I passed the whole test before he tells me I'm too old.
I should have remembered my wig.
The hell with everybody.
Come on, get going, for God's sake.
- Philo, are you out here?
- No, I ain't.
What are you doing?
Are you working on the car?
Orville, that's two dumb questions in a row you've asked me.
Here.
Help me put that block under the car here.
- This one here?
- Yeah.
You want it under the wheel or under the spring?
Under the spring.
There you go.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
Ma's pissed.
It's Clyde.
He got out this morning, came over, and shit all over everything.
How did she get him back?
That's what she's pissed about.
She had to bribe him with all her Oreos.
Well, I'll make it up to her.
- You got one going tomorrow?
- Yeah, you coming?
Sure am.
Who wants some action around here?
- There you go, my man.
What's the name?
- $40.
- Name?
- John Hatfield.
I got you, my man.
Thank you.
Who else?
How much you want?
Quick, talk to me, my man.
- Give me $80.
- $80.
Let me see that.
- Name?
- Jackson.
All right, listen, I've got $100.
Who wants to make a side-bet, here?
Come on, guys.
Talk up!
He may be good, but he ain't no Tank Murdock.
Take it.
- We won't have anything...
- Take it.
You're on.
- Who's gonna hold this?
- You hold it.
No problem, you're fine.
Church, let's go, man.
You got him.
- Come up here, Clyde.
There you go.
- Put this bum away!
Don't waste any time on the guy, just put him away.
Put him away now, Church!
Put him away.
Thank you. $5, $100 and $200 $500, $600, $900...
Clyde could have beat him.
I kind of like this.
That one's a redhead.
- I'll take the one on the left.
- All right.
The one stuffing her face with chowder.
Let's go over there and see what she's drinking.
Hi.
My name's Philo.
Do you mind if I sit here for a while?
Suit yourself.
I don't recall seeing you around here.
I've never been here before.
Where do you go when you're not here?
My name is Carol.
I go to USC.
I major in sociology.
I'm here because I'm doing a paper on the country-western mentality.
Well, that just blew five minutes of our conversation.
Well, you asked if you could sit.
You didn't say nothing about talking.
Who are you mad at?
- I don't suppose you have a light, do you?
- No, I don't smoke.
Excuse me.
Orville.
Tell me, just what is the country-western mentality?
Well, if the lyrics of this song are any indication it's somewhere between moron and dull-normal.
Oh, my...
Jesus Christ.
You are disgusting.
Let's leave.
Go.
What happened?
This wild clam got out of control.
Take it.
Did you see her face?
You could've put a turd in there and she couldn't gotten a better look on her.
Thank you so much.
Now, would you all put your hands together and keep the applause going?
Let's all give a big, big Palomino welcome to pretty Miss Lynn Halsey Taylor.
Thank you.
Okay.
Ready, boys?
Let's get out of here.
I want to watch this chick for a minute.
That's awful nice.
Lynn Halsey Taylor.
You can come back anytime, honey.
Excuse me.
Could I put this back there for a while?
- Sure can.
- Thank you.
- You sure sing pretty.
- Well, thank you.
I'd really be pleased if I could buy you a drink.
Sure.
- I'd like a beer.
- Two of those.
I didn't get your name in the introduction.
My name's Philo Beddoe.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?
- She sure ran out pretty fast.
- Oh, her.
I hardly knew her a minute.
A minute?
Well, you must go through a lot of women like that.
- That was a nice song.
Did you write that?
- No.
Wish I did.
Just a song my daddy used to sing to me when I was little.
When you were little?
That's where I know you from.
When I was in third grade I knew a girl that looked enough like you it makes my memory water.
You sure do talk funny.
Kind of smoky in here.
- Would you like to...
- I'd love to.
Say, it's kind of smoky in here.
So, I decided there was nothing I liked doing better than singing.
- So, here I am.
- Am I glad.
Row 3.
That's my lucky number.
I'll tell you what:
You're my lucky number.
Would you like to have me in for a while, maybe?
I'd love to.
- Only...
- Only?
- Only my boyfriend, Schyler, is sleeping.
- Boyfriend?
- He wouldn't mind.
- He wouldn't?
So long as you don't drive his car.
Well, I think maybe we could make it some other time when he ain't around.
Okay.
Whatever you say.
Slightly advanced.
Look, man, it's an ape!
Yeah.
Which one's the ape?
- What did you say?
- That looks your girlfriend.
Hey, buddy.
Are you taking your mother for a ride?
- Take that up there, baby.
- Hey.
- So long, apeshit.
- Son of a bitch.
What the hell's this?
We'll get them, right, boy?
Clyde, get your hands off the wheel.
- Let's get the hell out of here.
He's crazy.
- Follow me.
- Hey, why did you come in here?
- He'll never find us in here.
Get those things out of here.
Roll up your window.
Shit!
Get them out of here.
Freaks!
Hey, man, what in the hell is going on?
- Do you think we ought to stop and fight?
- Nope.
Let's catch that train.
Take it easy.
It's a monkey.
Crazy monkey!
Are you okay?
Thanks, Clyde.
If you don't like him, how come you stay with him?
Because he promised to help me get the $7,000.
"Best I can"
- For what?
- "It's hard for me to say no
"to a truck drivin' man"
For the down payment.
- What do you want to buy?
- "Cadillac that I still don't have the time
"Keep the fool who wants to marry me dangling on my line"
My own club back home in Denver.
I'm going to call it the Lynn Halsey-Taylor Drinking Fountain.
"Hard for me to say no to a truck driving man"
That will be the name of my group, too.
I'll have talent night three nights a week.
How much of the $7,000 do you have already?
He won't tell me.
Well, about the only thing of any value I've got is Clyde.
- Clyde?
- Yeah, he's my ape.
- I won him in a fight.
- You won him?
Yeah.
They brought him over here to make a baby.
- You mean he's from Africa?
- No, he's from Sumatra.
When he got here, the other male orang they had on hand had already done the job.
You're kidding?
Yeah, so Clyde got real mean as hell, so they sold him to a desert zoo.
- Desert zoo?
- One of those places out in the desert says, "Real, live dragon, cactus candy, five miles ahead," that sort of thing.
That's where I won him.
I bet my truck and two dirt bikes on him.
- You must have wanted him a lot.
- I really hated to see him in that cage.
- So, who'd you fight for him?
- These four guys.
Four guys?
You would have thought after the first couple lost they'd have given up.
- Well, I fought all four at once.
- All four at once?
- You like to fight?
- I used to.
Better than anything.
Well, almost anything.
So, why didn't you turn professional?
None of that stuff.
There's too many rules.
You're just a regular Tank Murdock.
- You know him?
- I know of him.
He's from Denver and he's a regular institution.
You bet he is.
Now that is one guy I'd like to meet up with.
Well, I'd really like to meet Clyde.
And you will.
You will.
Right now we'll meet my friend, Orville.
He's waiting on us.
So, Tank was in the back seat of this car with this debutante.
I mean, her daddy owned the whole town.
- And his buddy was in the trunk.
- And then what happened?
Well, you see, she was so pure that nobody believed these wild stories that Tank had been telling about her.
- What happened?
- You got to use your imagination, Orville.
Anyway, after she heard all this bumping around and laughing coming from the trunk.
And she started to scream.
So, all these cops came in, six or eight of them.
Tank tried to explain, but nobody believed him because they all knew him.
He must have put four cops in the hospital.
It took about 12 of them to take him in.
Man.
- One thing I want to know about the story.
- What?
Who let that poor guy out of the trunk?
Shit, he's probably still there.
Those two creeps over there asked me to bring this to the lady.
This was mighty nice of you.
- Do you see that?
- An arm?
No, that.
A tattoo?
They don't know what this means.
Do you see that?
- Sorry.
- Two tattoos.
Them's black widows.
Did you know that more people die from black widows than rattlers each year?
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Well, listen, I sure do appreciate knowing that because most of the people I know just step on them and squish them.
I don't need this cheap shit.
Orville, that's no way to thank two guys that just bought us a beer.
Why don't you get the check and I'll go outside and thank them properly?
Okay.
- Go ahead.
- You started it.
Shouldn't you go with him?
Sure is good pecan pie.
I think we'd better get out of here.
Cut it out, Clyde.
Ma, what'd you do that for?
Been trying to get your attention for five minutes.
Did you see Orville?
- Yeah.
I saw him.
- Well?
Orville tell you what?
Yeah, and I'm sorry, Ma, about you missing your driver's test again.
That ain't the one what I mean.
You mean Clyde?
I'm sorry about that too, Ma.
He won't do it again, I promise.
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What?
The crap or the Oreos?
About Clyde!
Goddamn it!
I don't have no privacy in my own home no more.
Well, I confronted him about it, Ma.
I guarantee it won't happen again.
No privacy in your own home.
A whole goddamn bag of Oreos.
Stop that, you goddamn baboon.
No respect.
No privacy.
No nothing.
Bang.
- You're late, pretty boy.
- Shut up.
I don't believe this.
Damn.
I never knew nobody who could hit so hard or so fast.
- He could've been Denver Tank Murdock.
- That's right.
- Sound like him?
- Don't know.
Didn't get to see him so close as Elmo.
At least I didn't drop my bike and run.
Like you two!
You big suckers!
Shut up!
Now, it isn't bad enough that you let somebody else kick your butts without you trying to do it to each other.
If we're all talking about the same man and I think we are then it appears he's got a rather growing collection of our bikes.
Yeah, but we don't know for sure if he took them or not.
- We were...
- Unconscious for two hours!
- Sick son of a bitch.
- It's not true!
Shut up!
The very first thing we do is find out who we're talking about.
I mean, we don't even know where to find him.
How are we going to find him?
Well, it appears to me that there can't be too many guys driving around this valley with an ape.
- What you got sticking out here?
- Open it.
- It sure feels heavy.
- Open it.
- Philo.
God, where'd you get this?
- Off a couple little old widows.
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.
More people are dying to buy widow bikes than are dying by rattler bites every year.
Well.
- You like it?
- Well, yeah.
That I do.
Wait until Clyde sees you in this outfit.
- What's the matter?
- I'm okay.
- House not too good tonight?
- I'm okay, Philo.
Well, at least this outfit you bought me was a big hit.
I don't like the way this guy's driving.
Get down!
Is that somebody you know?
Schyler.
- I thought you said he didn't care.
- He must have changed his mind.
Philo, I'm scared.
- I won't let anything happen to you.
- That's not what I'm afraid of.
I'm afraid for Schyler.
Please don't hurt him.
He tried to shoot me and didn't care that you were next to me.
That's just it.
He was just trying to scare you.
He doesn't even know how to shoot.
I sure don't like the way he's trying to find out.
Philo, I know him.
He's probably in there now hiding, scared out of his wits.
I don't like to see you cry.
Let me talk to him.
Please.
I don't know.
Please.
For me.
Please.
All right.
You talk to him.
And you tell him that I want you to come with me and I want you to stay with me, you hear?
Philo.
Here.
I want you to dry those tears.
- I want you to take this.
It's the dough.
- I couldn't take that.
Yes, you can.
I want you to have it now, you hear?
- Okay.
- I don't want you to cry no more.
Clyde, how'd you get out?
What, did you pull the lock off?
How'd you get out?
No, you don't.
Come on.
No, you don't.
Give me that!
Give me it!
What?
Good Clyde.
Just hold that truck up, Clyde.
What are you doing, Clyde?
- Philo.
- Yeah.
Call this son of a...
No, don't call him.
Don't call him.
Good Clyde.
That's it, Clyde.
Hold it up.
How many times have I told you?
I don't want him drinking beer, except on Saturday night.
- Don't expect I'll need these no more.
- Take it easy, Ma.
This is the easy part.
Awful glad there ain't no more of them squiggly pictures.
Good.
Maybe you'll do it this time.
Maybe.
Well, I guess I will.
Why didn't you tell him you wear glasses?
It's none of his goddamn business what I wear.
Just wear them to read, anyway.
Was there anything else?
Told me I was too old.
Meathead!
Orville.
Yes, Mother?
- Next time I'll wear my glasses.
- Good.
Goddamn it.
God, you're a handsome devil.
Clyde, you're going to meet a lady now.
I want you to handle it.
That means no spitting, pissing, farting or picking your ass.
You hear me?
Because if you do, I'll throttle you.
Understand?
Man, I'll tell you something.
Clyde, this has got to stop.
People are going to talk, you know?
- What is it?
- That trailer that was parked down there.
What happened to it?
- What spot?
- That spot right over there.
I don't see it.
- Well, where'd it go?
- It's gone.
I know it's gone, goddamn it, but where'd it go?
- Back home, I suppose.
- Denver?
Some folks just don't take me into their confidence.
The plates said Colorado.
Sound right to you?
- When'd they leave?
- This morning.
Thanks.
Goodbye, now.
Hey, Philo.
I've got a message for you.
Why don't you watch what the hell you're doing?
Why don't you shut your face, boy?
What have we got here?
A real, live, macho cowboy.
Don't turn your back.
- Somebody call the cops.
- They are the cops.
Shit.
- She didn't say where she was going?
- Nope.
- Well, how do you know where to look?
- I'll know.
Well, how do you know she wants you to come looking for her?
There you go asking those dumb questions again.
- Is Clyde going?
- Yes.
- You got room for one more?
- Yes.
Got you!
I'm coming.
- Which way are we headed?
- East.
Sounds reasonable.
East?
What are you gonna do with the baboon?
Orangutan, Ma.
Clyde's an orangutan.
- What's the difference?
- He has 12 ribs, just like you and me.
- What are you going to do with him?
- He's coming with me.
Come on.
Well, when are you coming back?
- When are you coming back?
- Whenever it's time, Ma.
It don't seem right to leave an old lady alone.
And what about my goddamn license?
This is...
It's just...
Twelve ribs.
I don't believe any of that shit!
This machine is very sensitive.
What do you think you'll find here?
You never know what you'll find here.
Just listen.
It picks up all kinds of metal.
Swiss watches, expensive foreign cameras, silver dollars.
Gold, man.
- Gold?
- Yeah.
- Herb.
- Yeah.
What are we going to do about that son of a bitch?
- Who?
- You know who I'm talking about.
That cowboy at the Palomino Club.
I don't know what you can do about him.
What can we do, man?
You mean to stand there and tell me you'd let him get away with it?
You got anything in mind?
What I got in mind is to break his stupid head.
- Listen, are you sure that thing works?
- Sure it works.
Just keep digging.
Besides, you don't even know where to find him.
Don't worry.
I'll find him.
I got a plan.
- What's that?
- I'm going to use my medical leave.
What are you laughing at?
You're going to spend your two weeks medical leave looking for him?
I'll spend the next two years looking for him if I have to.
- What's up?
- Pit stop.
- Are these cantaloupes fresh?
- Yes.
- Are they today's?
- Yes.
They just came in.
No, I only want a quarter of a pound.
These only cost a quarter a pound.
I only want a quarter of a pound of tomatoes.
Yes, ma'am.
Right.
Can I have a fresh bag now?
I'll take these two cantaloupes.
How much are they a pound?
Cantaloupes are 29 cents a pound.
I think they were cheaper down the road.
I don't know why you're so expensive here.
Ma'am.
- Can you help me out?
- Sure.
- What's your name?
- Echo.
Echo.
Do you want some cantaloupes?
Those are beautiful.
Thank you.
How many would you like?
Do you live around here?
Yeah.
Down past the wash.
Where's the wash?
How come you want to know so much about me?
Because I never met anyone that made me feel like you do.
Right out of the gate.
- Where are you headed?
- East.
- What's your name?
- Echo.
- What?
- Echo.
Orville.
What did you say, anyway, that made that woman storm away?
I told her you had the clap.
All right, spread out.
- Hey, heifer, how's the slop?
- Suits the clientele real good.
Looking real good.
Don't you got no special of the day?
Liver and onions.
Why don't you read the menu?
Maybe I'd rather talk to you.
Has Philo Beddoe been around?
You want to talk, take a walk.
You want to eat, take a seat.
What are you laughing at?
Lard-ass!
I'll tell you what:
Turn around and walk out that door, and I'll forget what you said.
And I won't tell everybody that you drink horse piss.
- Elmo, Cholla, did you hear what he said?
- I heard it.
- I'll just keep this warm for you, Lester.
- Okay, big mouth, let's go.
You want me to keep a piece of that lemon meringue?
Yeah, this won't take but a minute.
Let's go, cutes.
Drinking horse piss.
What is this?
- Hey, come on!
- Get him, come on!
Kick him in the nuts.
Kick him in the shins.
Come on over here.
Give me a hand.
Where you going?
Get back here.
That's it.
Get this little son of a gun right there.
Good.
Hurry up.
Get out of there, Roy.
Look out.
My God.
Spread out!
Goddamn morphadites.
Come on.
Get the hell out of the way.
Hurry.
Let's go.
Move it.
- Who is it?
- The police.
I'm coming.
I'm coming, goddamn it!
What do you want with an old lady?
Ma'am, we're looking for Philo Beddoe.
Our records say he lives at this address.
Well, your records are wrong.
He lives at that address in the back.
What do you want him for?
- Just looking for him, ma'am.
- Well, he don't live there anymore.
He's gone off.
Took that son of a bitch, Clyde, with him.
Clyde?
His ape.
His ape?
You heard me.
What you making me repeat myself for?
Do you know where he's gone?
Who gives a damn?
Stealing all my Oreos.
Crapping all over the place.
Twelve ribs, my ass!
- Thank you.
Sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry, too, you see.
Leave an old lady alone, fending for herself.
No protection.
It just don't seem...
Well, I don't suppose you know of a ladies' room hereabouts?
They're all over.
Just pick one.
- She's something, ain't she?
- She sure is.
You're full of all kinds of surprises these days.
Listen, I want to say that I appreciate your making her feel at home.
Clyde.
There's something out there!
God, it's horrible!
It's a monster.
- It's not even a bear.
It's a...
- No, Echo, it's just Clyde.
Hey, Echo!
Wait.
Give me...
What?
Take it easy.
You're going to scare him.
- Me, scare him?
- That's right.
Let me introduce you.
Echo, this is Clyde.
Clyde, this is Echo.
Echo.
Did you get it?
It's okay.
See?
- Hey, granny, how they hanging?
- Hey, hot damn.
- What are you doing tonight, honey?
- Let her alone.
She's mine.
I saw her first.
- Say, old lady.
Where's Philo Beddoe?
- How the hell do I know?
Get off my porch with that thing.
Get off my property!
You're not very hospitable.
Hospitable, my ass.
Get off my porch!
Very well.
If you insist.
All right, lady.
Put that gun down!
I'm warning you, lady.
Put down that gun, now!
Wait for me!
First, the police.
I told those boys not to leave a vulnerable old lady all alone.
Hospitable?
Horseshit!
- Police.
- Yeah?
I want to ask you questions about a girl.
Her name was Lynn Halslay-Taylor.
Halsey.
Yeah.
She was here, but she left.
Hey, man.
How come that cat ain't moving?
You think he's dead?
Shit, man, if he's the only one here, let's have some fun.
Shut up!
But he's only one old man.
It was only one old woman that nearly ruinated all of you.
Yeah.
Maybe we ought to split.
Hello, there.
You in there?
What is it?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, I'm looking for a girl that used to stay around here.
- She was with a guy named Philo Beddoe.
- Don't know no Philo Beddoe.
Well, the girl's name was Halsey-Taylor.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
She must've been one jim-dandy of a girl.
You're the third one come to ask about her since she left for Denver.
- You don't say.
- Yeah.
- Could I put that back there?
- Sure, doll.
It'll be here when you need it.
- Buy you a drink?
- Sure.
Taste that, too.
Here.
Get out of my stuff, Clyde.
Here, take a piece of this.
That's my salad.
Why don't you two take the truck?
Clyde and I are going to go check around.
- What's going on?
- Orville, you've got to get up.
- Why?
- Because it just isn't right, that's why.
- What isn't right?
- What isn't right?
It just ain't right.
I mean...
I mean, you two have somebody.
And I've almost got somebody.
And it just ain't right.
- Well, what isn't right about it?
- You just don't understand, do you?
Yeah.
He just doesn't understand.
Right, and that's why we've got to do something about it.
We do?
Yeah.
Here.
Off your ass and on your feet.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Clyde, damn it.
You think he doesn't understand.
He sits back there all the time.
You don't think he understands, but he's smart.
And I'll tell you something, Orville.
He thinks about a lot of things besides Oreo cookies.
Right, Clyde?
- You don't mean...
- I mean exactly that.
Where the hell are we going to get Clyde laid in the middle of the night?
Shit.
How the hell do you break into a zoo?
It's easy.
Zoos are meant to keep everybody in.
Listen to that.
He knows something good will happen.
Well, how do you know there's a lady in there for him?
I don't, but if there is one there and he doesn't find it, he wouldn't know what to do, anyway.
Give me a hand.
Come on.
Well, what do you want us to do?
The place is probably guarded, so I want you to stay here and keep an eye out.
Come on, pal.
Okay.
All right, Clyde.
Up.
Boy, I bet there's a gal in there.
Think there's a lady in there?
You bet, man.
Clyde, you think there's a lady in there?
Come on.
Clyde.
Orville.
When we get to this next town, you should drum up some action.
We're getting a little short on cash.
Sure, why not.
Do you know where the meat-packing plant is?
- No.
But I'll find it.
- All right, I'll see you there.
You got it.
I don't care much for that perfume they're wearing.
- Do they know me here?
- No, it's even money.
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
Guy's name is Kincaid.
He's a local champion.
Taller than you.
About 240 pounds.
I checked.
- And?
- They say he stacks up to Tank Murdock.
Tank Murdock?
You know, like them all, Tank's gonna fall.
And another thing, he fights dirty.
- Orville Boggs?
- You got it.
Okay, open the gate.
It's over there in the cold room.
- How much you want?
- What you got?
- $1,200.
- We'll take it.
You've got to show me something besides conversation.
- I'll take that.
- All right, if I see yours.
What do you want us to do with the body?
Save your breath.
It's enough you'll lose your money.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, baby!
What's up?
I want you.
Come on, Philo, put him away!
Don't let him tag you!
What the hell are you doing, Philo?
It's getting cold in here!
- I think you owe us some money.
- What money?
Wait a minute.
You aren't gonna tell all these boys that you'll take their money, are you?
That was just so you'd know the first one was no accident.
Did you see this little filly shoot?
Where did you ever learn to do that?
You could shoot a gnat off a buffalo's ass.
- I told you I could take care of myself.
- She took care of us.
Car 103.
Proceed to the intersection of Interstate 5 and Velasquez Road for a 602.
103 here.
Got you, over.
That 602's the same as our 406.
No way.
It's got to be the same as our 309 or at the best our 213.
You're crazy.
No New Mexican 602 can come anywhere near California 309.
When's the last time you been out on a 309?
Maybe three or four months.
But it don't mean that I don't know that our 309 ain't more than their 602.
- What time you got?
- 6:07.
Unit 103, abort that 602, 103.
Proceed to Velasquez Road on Interstate 5 for a 607.
Well, kiss my...
I suppose you think I'm crazy traipsing across the country after a girl I hardly even know.
Hell, I'm not like Orville.
It takes me a long time to get to know a girl.
Even longer to let her know me.
You know what I mean?
I'm not afraid of any man, but sharing my feelings with a woman my stomach just turns to royal gelatin.
I don't suppose that ever happens to you.
I guess you just keep howling until sometime they howl back.
If this is a strike, it means Ronstadt and Parton move over.
It's Halsey-Taylor to the top.
It's okay.
It just means it's going to take a little longer.
But we don't give up.
If I get this pickup it means the same time next year Halsey-Taylor has her own special.
That was a mighty fine pickup, little lady.
Thank you.
Will you mind Clyde for me?
I'm going to take a run.
All right.
Shit!
Hey, Lynn!
Wait up!
Fancy meeting you here.
Incredible is more like it.
What are you doing?
Following you.
You picked me up just in time.
All this weather.
You took off so fast I thought there was something wrong.
Bad time to run.
I figured maybe I'd better follow you.
Thought you'd better, huh?
Hell, you didn't even get a chance to meet Clyde.
Pull in right here.
I know where he keeps the money now, so it's a matter of finding the right time.
I still say my way would be quicker.
Philo, you promised.
Please don't make me sorry I told you.
You make me afraid to believe you.
I never want to make you sorry.
You want to come down and meet everybody?
No, I'd better go back.
We'll do it when we have more time.
Tomorrow night?
Like we agreed?
El Patio Restaurant.
Philo?
You're really something.
Jesus Christ.
Goddamn, I don't believe what I'm seeing.
I think I'm still asleep and dreaming.
You're not dreaming.
Come on.
Get your ass up.
Hi, Clyde.
How you doing?
Let's let the little lady up.
What did you do that for?
I think he's trying to tell us something.
What's he trying to tell us?
Why are you so all fired happy, Philo?
Listen, the only time I ever see you smiling is when...
You got laid?
You were jogging, and you picked up somebody and laid her.
- Did he?
- I'll do you one better than that.
- You mean Clyde got laid again, too?
- No.
I ran into Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
How'd you do that?
I was running down the highway and she picked me up.
- Where is she now?
- She's in town.
She's getting things straightened up, we'll see her.
Goddamn, that is good news.
That means we can go home soon.
I don't see why not.
While we're waiting around for true romance I think I'll jump down and get some flies.
There's no way I don't want to get in on this action.
- Help me finish these first, will you?
- Right.
Did you ever notice how drinking and fishing kind of go together?
- You sell fishing licenses in here?
- Sure do.
Something about the six-pack and the worms.
- Any good trout around here?
- About four or five miles down the road.
Orville.
Don't these look like the humpers Clyde was eating this morning?
Are these the flies Philo wanted?
Grayish yellow.
Hey, Philo.
Where's your boat?
I'm going to hang out here on shore.
Echo and I are going on down to the other end here.
- We got him?
- Got him.
Here.
Be careful, it's loaded.
Why the scattergun?
- Because I don't want to miss that sucker.
- Makes sense.
Here.
Why all the fishing gear?
Because we got to look like we're going fishing, dummy.
Now look, I'll go right through there.
You go around the lake and come from behind him.
I'm going around this lake...
Damn it.
Not so loud.
He'll hear you.
It's not so far.
And here.
Get going.
Now get going, will you?
Stinking hippie.
Quite a mess of fish.
Shit.
The white boy's the craziest son of a bitch in the world.
Where in the hell is that Putnam?
What are you doing, boy?
My God!
Feet!
Feet don't fail me now, man.
Goddamn apes, snakes, alligators and shit!
You so much as blink, and I'll blow a big hole in you.
Who are you and what do you want?
Just never you mind.
You'll find out soon enough.
What the hell was that?
- Jesus.
- Good Lord.
He must be 5 or 6 pounds.
Give him some slack.
Don't jerk, you'll lose him!
God, he's a monster.
Don't jerk him!
Give me that rod!
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
He's a monster!
He's a frigging monster!
I've never seen anything like it before.
He must weigh 25 pounds.
He's a stud!
He's got to be a stud!
Come on, help me here.
Boy, he is a stud!
- Have a stud.
- Shit!
Putnam!
Big, dumb galoot.
Putnam, where are you?
Dummy.
What was that?
I think he's spending too much time with Clyde.
What are we supposed to do with all this stuff?
Eat it.
All of it.
- "All of it"?
- All of it.
What if I can't?
Then we'll give it to Clyde.
Can you imagine what this would do to Clyde's digestive tract?
He already has enough gas to go to North Denver.
And he's never seen a bean in his life.
Say, when's your little lady coming here?
She should be along any time.
Let's get out of here.
Listen, Philo.
Does that mean we're going back to L.A.?
Hell, no.
But when I find her I'll take care of that guy she's with.
My way.
Hey, an Airstream!
Hey, Cholla!
That's the one!
Howdy.
I bet you're Lynn Halsey-Taylor, ain't you?
Now how'd you know that?
Well, we been following you, all the way from Los Angeles.
You see me sing at the Palomino?
I'm sorry to say, I missed that, but I promise not to miss it next time.
Well, then, what did all you boys follow me all the way to Colorado for?
Do you know a guy named Philo?
Philo Beddoe?
He's been following you.
You know that?
Yeah, I know that.
Is he a friend of yours?
Not particularly.
You want to find him?
Not particularly.
We do.
Now, that's a nice looking truck.
There she is.
You stay here.
This is personal.
Lynn!
You Philo Beddoe?
Do I know you?
You're going to.
Last time I saw you two, you were going for a fast freight.
The last time we saw you, you were dirt-diving in an alfalfa patch.
Philo Beddoe.
Your time has come.
Here we go again.
I got him.
The bikes, you dummies!
The bikes!
The bikes!
Are those guys coming after me?
Those guys are coming after me!
I'll get him!
I'm going to kill you all!
Look out!
Watch out for the truck!
Hi, cutie pie.
Want a ride?
- Don't mind if I do.
- Hop in.
Darling, I'm only glad you happened along when you did.
Nice day for a drive.
- Look at these guys coming up the road.
- I love this.
Ten points.
Get out of the way!
There's the boy.
- Thanks.
- Make sure that door's closed, would you?
Let's go get a bite to eat.
No, you go on ahead.
Clyde and me will eat later.
We'll bring you back something, okay, Philo?
Whatever.
He's locked into that phone book.
He must have called every place in town.
What are you hungry for?
Are you sure you don't want me to go in there and just hang out?
- He pulled a shotgun last time.
- This is personal.
I'll handle it.
Why don't Echo and I just go in and have a beer and listen to the music?
- Do you want to borrow my pea shooter?
- Thanks.
You two go have a good time.
See if you can find out the location of Tank Murdock.
- What will you have?
- A beer.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor, everybody.
All right!
It's great to have you back in Denver, Lynn.
And now, everybody, the featured performer of the evening the star of tonight's show, Mr. Charlie Rich.
The best club out there is the Palomino, and the manager's a good friend.
So, I'll write him, tell him to give you a spot.
That's mighty nice of you.
Like me?
Want me?
- Let's go.
- Harlan.
I've got a friend.
It's okay, though.
He won't mind, he just might want to come along.
Let's go.
- Is this your...
- No.
You want to talk to him?
The lady and I have a little business.
I expect you'll be excusing us.
Maybe you ought to excuse yourself.
It's okay, Harlan, I'll just be a minute.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's your own goddamn fault!
Who asked you to follow me?
- I just thought...
- You thought!
If you'd thought, you would've taken some very broad hints.
I've been trying to get rid of you practically ever since the first night we met.
- What about Taos?
- What about it?
I need it just like anybody else.
- You do this all the time.
- I do this all the time.
And you and me had our time, so why don't you know when to disappear?
- Come here.
- Take your hands off me!
Lynn?
Is everything all right?
Schyler, this is the one from L.A. The big, dumb one I told you about.
Schyler, with the shotgun?
That was my idea.
I was hoping he'd scare you away.
Why didn't you just say goodbye?
You're here, aren't you?
Guys like you don't understand goodbye.
What do you do?
You hustle for him?
You're just not too smart, are you?
Why did you have to come?
Why couldn't you quit like everybody else?
You had to come chasing me and spoil it all.
I guess I'm just not too smart, that's all.
Up to now, I'm the only one dumb enough to want to take you further than your bed.
I hate you!
I hate you.
I hate you.
Well, listen, do you want to rest up a little bit?
- You don't have to take him tonight.
- No, that's fine.
- Are you Philo Beddoe?
- That's right.
Keep on walking, you'll see him.
- Here you go.
- Is that all the money?
- What's with the girl?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, "Don't worry about it"?
Right to your left.
Don't worry about it, Philo.
This guy's a real porker.
He's carrying his reputation around his waist.
Looks like you've had a go at it already.
You sure that face won't hurt too much to fight?
- I ain't going to hit you with my face.
- That's funny.
I like you.
Don't worry, we'll get this over in a hurry and take care of you.
Where did you hear of Tank Murdock before, kid?
- All around.
- Yeah?
- They say you're the best.
- They do?
Well, let's get with it.
Jesus Christ, who is that guy?
I don't know, but he's the one that'll beat Tank Murdock.
Come on, Tank!
Come on, get him!
Jesus Christ, that guy's going to beat Tank Murdock!
Get up!
Come on!
This guy will be the new Tank Murdock!
- This is it for Tank!
- Who is this guy?
The new guy's beaten Tank!
You has-been!
You ought to learn to box!
You old bum!
You're all washed up!
That guy's the new Tank Murdock.
We're going to make money on this guy.
My champ!
"5, Z."
Just a minute there, now. "B."
Why don't you try that one with your glasses on?
Yes.
Why didn't I think of that?
- There.
Now try it again.
- Thank you, I will.
"5, Z, B, D, F."
- You did it.
- Of course I did.
Now, if you'd please step over there for your photograph.
- My what?
- Your photograph.
To put on your license.
My photograph.
Well, what will they think of next?
I think I forgot my comb.
Don't you worry.
Your hair looks quite lovely.
Do you really think so?
All right, you ready?
Let me get you focused.
All right, now smile.
Big smile.
Son of a bitch.
Anyway, the cop is sitting there, sipping his coffee, you see?
And he's scratching his head.
He's completely confused by now.
- He says to the drunk...
- How's it going, Philo?
..."What about the guy in bed with your wife?"
And the drunk says, "The hell with him.
Let him make his own coffee. "
You get it?
"Let him make his own coffee. "
Excuse me.
That's funny, but don't give up your day job.
Come on, Big Al.
Let's have some fun.
You want to go some place?
- Hey, Big Al.
Are you married?
- I used to be.
I know this place in the valley.
We could go get a couple drinks.
Lots of action there.
Great fun.
What do you say?
Hey.
Put them back.
- You talking to me?
- This ain't the Salvation Army.
Put them back.
I got plenty of peanuts, Big Al.
- You mean these?
- Yeah, asshole.
- Unless you're taking them to your tree.
- Shit.
Excuse me, gents.
The squirrel is taking his peanuts up to his tree.
The squirrel is ripping off peanuts, ain't you, squirrel?
Going to take them up to your tree?
All right.
- Come on, guys.
Knock it off.
- Get him!
Attaboy!
- Come on, get out of here, you guys.
- Get him.
Outside.
Come on, guys.
Outside!
Hey, Orville, what's doing?
Ma's going to try it again.
I should have remembered my wig.
You think it'll make any difference?
I don't know, Ma.
I don't expect that's all they're going to be looking at.
Don't be in such a fired, big hurry.
I want to look at these pictures one time more.
I always did have trouble with these squiggly lines.
I hope you pass it this time, Ma, because there ain't too many more of these places we can go to.
They all know you.
They don't know how I drive.
Don't none of them know how good I drive.
Been driving since before them sons of bitches were born.
Come on, get out.
Here.
You're getting pretty tricky, Clyde.
You've done real good, Ma.
Meathead.
Waited till I passed the whole test before he tells me I'm too old.
I should have remembered my wig.
The hell with everybody.
Come on, get going, for God's sake.
- Philo, are you out here?
- No, I ain't.
What are you doing?
Are you working on the car?
Orville, that's two dumb questions in a row you've asked me.
Here.
Help me put that block under the car here.
- This one here?
- Yeah.
You want it under the wheel or under the spring?
Under the spring.
There you go.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
Ma's pissed.
It's Clyde.
He got out this morning, came over, and shit all over everything.
How did she get him back?
That's what she's pissed about.
She had to bribe him with all her Oreos.
Well, I'll make it up to her.
- You got one going tomorrow?
- Yeah, you coming?
Sure am.
Who wants some action around here?
- There you go, my man.
What's the name?
- $40.
- Name?
- John Hatfield.
I got you, my man.
Thank you.
Who else?
How much you want?
Quick, talk to me, my man.
- Give me $80.
- $80.
Let me see that.
- Name?
- Jackson.
All right, listen, I've got $100.
Who wants to make a side-bet, here?
Come on, guys.
Talk up!
He may be good, but he ain't no Tank Murdock.
Take it.
- We won't have anything...
- Take it.
You're on.
- Who's gonna hold this?
- You hold it.
No problem, you're fine.
Church, let's go, man.
You got him.
- Come up here, Clyde.
There you go.
- Put this bum away!
Don't waste any time on the guy, just put him away.
Put him away now, Church!
Put him away.
Thank you. $5, $100 and $200 $500, $600, $900...
Clyde could have beat him.
